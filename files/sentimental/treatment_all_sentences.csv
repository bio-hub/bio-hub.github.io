31944312,Respiratory tract viral infection caused by viruses or bacteria is one of the most common diseases in human worldwide, while those caused by emerging viruses, such as the novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV that caused the pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, China most recently, have posed great threats to global public health.
31944312,Identification of the causative viral pathogens of respiratory tract viral infections is important to select an appropriate treatment, save people's lives, stop the epidemics, and avoid unnecessary use of antibiotics.
31944312,Conventional diagnostic tests, such as the assays for rapid detection of antiviral antibodies or viral antigens, are widely used in many clinical laboratories.
31944312,With the development of modern technologies, new diagnostic strategies, including multiplex nucleic acid amplification and microarray-based assays, are emerging.
31944312,This review summarizes currently available and novel emerging diagnostic methods for the detection of common respiratory viruses, such as influenza virus, human respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus, human adenovirus, and human rhinovirus.
31944312,Multiplex assays for simultaneous detection of multiple respiratory viruses are also described.
31944312,It is anticipated that such data will assist researchers and clinicians to develop appropriate diagnostic strategies for timely and effective detection of respiratory virus infections.
31981224,Coronaviruses (CoVs) are by far the largest group of known positive-sense RNA viruses having an extensive range of natural hosts.
31981224,In the past few decades, newly evolved Coronaviruses have posed a global threat to public health.
31981224,The immune response is essential to control and eliminate CoV infections, however, maladjusted immune responses may result in immunopathology and impaired pulmonary gas exchange.
31981224,Gaining a deeper understanding of the interaction between Coronaviruses and the innate immune systems of the hosts may shed light on the development and persistence of inflammation in the lungs and hopefully can reduce the risk of lung inflammation caused by CoVs.
31981224,In this review, we provide an update on CoV infections and relevant diseases, particularly the host defense against CoV-induced inflammation of lung tissue, as well as the role of the innate immune system in the pathogenesis and clinical treatment.
31986264,A recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
31986264,We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.
31986264,All patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan.
31986264,We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.
31986264,Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records.
31986264,Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data.
31986264,Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.
31986264,By Jan 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.
31986264,Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).
31986264,Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0-58·0). 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market.
31986264,One family cluster was found.
31986264,Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (three [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (two [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3%] of 38).
31986264,Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0-13·0]). 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia.
31986264,All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.
31986264,Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]). 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.
31986264,Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNFα.
31986264,The 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality.
31986264,Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.

31996494,As of January 22, 2020, a total of 571 cases of the 2019-new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) have been reported in 25 provinces (districts and cities) in China.
31996494,At present, there is no vaccine or antiviral treatment for human and animal coronavirus, so that identifying the drug treatment options as soon as possible is critical for the response to the 2019-nCoV outbreak.
31996494,Three general methods, which include existing broad-spectrum antiviral drugs using standard assays, screening of a chemical library containing many existing compounds or databases, and the redevelopment of new specific drugs based on the genome and biophysical understanding of individual coronaviruses, are used to discover the potential antiviral treatment of human pathogen coronavirus.
31996494,Lopinavir /Ritonavir, Nucleoside analogues, Neuraminidase inhibitors, Remdesivir, peptide (EK1), abidol, RNA synthesis inhibitors (such as TDF, 3TC), anti-inflammatory drugs (such as hormones and other molecules), Chinese traditional medicine, such ShuFengJieDu Capsules and Lianhuaqingwen Capsule, could be the drug treatment options for 2019-nCoV.
31996494,However, the efficacy and safety of these drugs for 2019- nCoV still need to be further confirmed by clinical experiments.
32017984,On 10 January 2020, a new coronavirus causing a pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan City in central China was denoted as 2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization (WHO).
32017984,As of 24 January 2020, there were 887 confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV infection, including 26 deaths, reported in China and other countries.
32017984,Therefore, combating this new virus and stopping the epidemic is a matter of urgency.
32017984,Here, we focus on advances in research and development of fast diagnosis methods, as well as potential prophylactics and therapeutics to prevent or treat 2019-nCoV infection.
32020915,The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, which initially began in China, has spread to many countries around the globe, with the number of confirmed cases increasing every day.
32020915,With a death toll exceeding that of the SARS-CoV outbreak back in 2002 and 2003 in China, 2019-nCoV has led to a public health emergency of international concern, putting all health organizations on high alert.
32020915,Herein, we present on an overview of the currently available information on the pathogenesis, epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of this virus.
32022370,With the current trajectory of the 2019-nCoV outbreak unknown, public health and medicinal measures will both be needed to contain spreading of the virus and to optimize patient outcomes.
32022370,Although little is known about the virus, an examination of the genome sequence shows strong homology with its better-studied cousin, SARS-CoV.
32022370,The spike protein used for host cell infection shows key nonsynonymous mutations that might hamper the efficacy of previously developed therapeutics but remains a viable target for the development of biologics and macrocyclic peptides.
32022370,Other key drug targets, including RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and coronavirus main proteinase (3CLpro), share a strikingly high (&gt;95 %) homology to SARS-CoV.
32022370,Herein, we suggest four potential drug candidates (an ACE2-based peptide, remdesivir, 3CLpro-1 and a novel vinylsulfone protease inhibitor) that could be used to treat patients suffering with the 2019-nCoV.
32022370,We also summarize previous efforts into drugging these targets and hope to help in the development of broad-spectrum anti-coronaviral agents for future epidemics.
32023681,Since December 2019, China has been experiencing an outbreak of new infectious disease caused by 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).

32023681,China rapidly identified 2019-nCoV-related pneumonia a statutory infectious disease.
32023681,To standardize the diagnosis and treatment of this new infectious disease, operational guidelines for the diagnosis and management of 2019-nCoV infection is accomplished by Peking Union Medical College Hospital.
32023681,2019年12月以来，我国陆续出现2019新型冠状病毒(2019-nCoV)感染引起的以肺部病变为主的新型传染病。
32023681,临床特征是发热、干咳、气促及X线胸片炎症性改变等。
32023681,我国已将2019-nCoV感染的肺炎定为法定传染病。
32023681,为规范这一新发突发传染病的诊疗，特制订北京协和医院关于&quot;2019-nCoV感染的肺炎&quot;诊疗建议方案。.
32023682,The outbreak of pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV in Wuhan, Hubei province of China, at the end of 2019 shaped tremendous challenges to China's public health and clinical treatment.
32023682,The virus belongs to the β genus Coronavirus in the family Corornaviridae, and is closely related to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, causing severe symptoms of pneumonia.
32023682,The virus is transmitted through droplets, close contact, and other means, and patients in the incubation period could potentially transmit the virus to other persons.
32023682,According to current observations, 2019-nCoV is weaker than SARS in pathogenesis, but has stronger transmission competence; it's mechanism of cross-species spread might be related with angiotensin-converting enzyme Ⅱ (ACE2), which is consistent with the receptor SARS-CoV.
32023682,After the outbreak of this disease, Chinese scientists invested a lot of energy to carry out research by developing rapid diagnostic reagents, identifying the characters of the pathogen, screening out clinical drugs that may inhibit the virus, and are rapidly developing vaccines.
32023682,The emergence of 2019-nCoV reminds us once again of the importance of establishing a systematic coronavirus surveillance network.
32023682,It also poses new challenges to prevention and control of the emerging epidemic and rapidly responses on scientific research.
32023682,2019年岁末，在武汉暴发新型冠状病毒（2019-nCoV）引起的肺炎流行，给我国公共卫生和临床救治带来巨大挑战。
32023682,2019-nCoV属于冠状病毒科β冠状病毒属，与严重急性呼吸综合征相关冠状病毒（SARS-CoV）和中东呼吸综合征相关冠状病毒（MERS-CoV）近缘，都会导致严重肺炎症状。
32023682,该病毒经飞沫、接触等途径传播，潜伏期患者即具备传播性。
32023682,目前数据表明：2019-nCoV比SARS-CoV毒力弱，但传播力强；造成其能够跨种传播的受体可能与SARS-CoV一致，都是血管紧张素转化酶Ⅱ（ACE2）。
32023682,在此疾病暴发后，我国科技人员投入大量精力开展研究，快速开发出诊断试剂，初步确定了病原特性，并已筛选出可能抑制该病毒的临床药物，也正在加快研发疫苗。
32023682,2019-nCoV的出现再次提醒我们建立系统的冠状病毒监测网络的重要性；也给突发疫情防控和应急科研提出了新挑战。.
32023684,At the end of 2019, sporadic and clustered case with &quot;pneumonia of unknown origin&quot; emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province.
32023684,The causative pathogen was quickly confirmed as &quot;2019-nCoV&quot; .
32023684,The epidemic soon spread throughout the country and became a pandemic in over a month.
32023684,Government and medical institutions across the country mobilized all kinds of resources and took a variety of measures to actively treat patients and stop the epidemic.
32023684,Based on current studies, the author summarized the clinical characteristics and evolution of the novel viral pneumonia, and proposed the key points of diagnosis and treatment, the scientific management of both confirmed and suspected cases, and the scientific management of disease prevention and control.
32023684,2019年末湖北武汉，首先发现以&quot;不明原因发热伴肺炎&quot;为主要症状的散发和聚集性病例，经确认是由2019-nCoV新型冠状病毒感染所致，疫情由早期确诊病例逐渐增加到近一月余全国各省份和其他国家出现蔓延态势。
32023684,全国各医疗机构、各部门动员力量，采取多种措施，积极救治病人、扼制疫情进展。
32023684,笔者用现有研究发现和资料，对此新型病毒的特点、对疾病的临床规律和诊疗重点、对确诊和疑似病例的临床科学管理以及对传染病防控的科学管理，进行了总结归纳并提出了思考。.
32026148,Since December 2019, an epidemic caused by novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection has occurred unexpectedly in China.
32026148,As of 8 pm, 31 January 2020, more than 20 pediatric cases have been reported in China.
32026148,Of these cases, ten patients were identified in Zhejiang Province, with an age of onset ranging from 112 days to 17 years.
32026148,Following the latest National recommendations for diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia caused by 2019-nCoV (the 4th edition) and current status of clinical practice in Zhejiang Province, recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of respiratory infection caused by 2019-nCoV for children were drafted by the National Clinical Research Center for Child Health, the National Children's Regional Medical Center, Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine to further standardize the protocol for diagnosis and treatment of respiratory infection in children caused by 2019-nCoV.
32027631,On December 31, 2019, Chinese health officials reported a cluster of cases of acute respiratory illness in persons associated with the Hunan seafood and animal market in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, in central China.
32027631,On January 7, 2020, Chinese health officials confirmed that a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was associated with this initial cluster (1).
32027631,As of February 4, 2020, a total of 20,471 confirmed cases, including 2,788 (13.6%) with severe illness,* and 425 deaths (2.1%) had been reported by the National Health Commission of China (2).
32027631,Cases have also been reported in 26 locations outside of mainland China, including documentation of some person-to-person transmission and one death (2).
32027631,As of February 4, 11 cases had been reported in the United States.
32027631,On January 30, the World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General declared that the 2019-nCoV outbreak constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.<sup>†</sup> On January 31, the U.S.
32027631,Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary declared a U.S. public health emergency to respond to 2019-nCoV.<sup>§</sup> Also on January 31, the president of the United States signed a &quot;Proclamation on Suspension of Entry as Immigrants and Nonimmigrants of Persons who Pose a Risk of Transmitting 2019 Novel Coronavirus,&quot; which limits entry into the United States of persons who traveled to mainland China to U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents and their families (3).
32027631,CDC, multiple other federal agencies, state and local health departments, and other partners are implementing aggressive measures to slow transmission of 2019-nCoV in the United States (4,5).
32027631,These measures require the identification of cases and their contacts in the United States and the appropriate assessment and care of travelers arriving from mainland China to the United States.
32027631,These measures are being implemented in anticipation of additional 2019-nCoV cases in the United States.
32027631,Although these measures might not prevent the eventual establishment of ongoing, widespread transmission of the virus in the United States, they are being implemented to 1) slow the spread of illness; 2) provide time to better prepare health care systems and the general public to be ready if widespread transmission with substantial associated illness occurs; and 3) better characterize 2019-nCoV infection to guide public health recommendations and the development of medical countermeasures including diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines.
32027631,Public health authorities are monitoring the situation closely.
32027631,As more is learned about this novel virus and this outbreak, CDC will rapidly incorporate new knowledge into guidance for action by CDC and state and local health departments.
32029004,In December 2019, a new type viral pneumonia cases occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province; and then named &quot;2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)&quot; by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 12 January 2020.
32029004,For it is a never been experienced respiratory disease before and with infection ability widely and quickly, it attracted the world's attention but without treatment and control manual.
32029004,For the request from frontline clinicians and public health professionals of 2019-nCoV infected pneumonia management, an evidence-based guideline urgently needs to be developed.
32029004,Therefore, we drafted this guideline according to the rapid advice guidelines methodology and general rules of WHO guideline development; we also added the first-hand management data of Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University.
32029004,This guideline includes the guideline methodology, epidemiological characteristics, disease screening and population prevention, diagnosis, treatment and control (including traditional Chinese Medicine), nosocomial infection prevention and control, and disease nursing of the 2019-nCoV.
32029004,Moreover, we also provide a whole process of a successful treatment case of the severe 2019-nCoV infected pneumonia and experience and lessons of hospital rescue for 2019-nCoV infections.
32029004,This rapid advice guideline is suitable for the first frontline doctors and nurses, managers of hospitals and healthcare sections, community residents, public health persons, relevant researchers, and all person who are interested in the 2019-nCoV.
32031570,In December 2019, novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)-infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, China.
32031570,The number of cases has increased rapidly but information on the clinical characteristics of affected patients is limited.
32031570,To describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of NCIP.

32031570,Documented NCIP.
32031570,Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data were collected and analyzed.
32031570,Outcomes of critically ill patients and noncritically ill patients were compared.
32031570,Presumed hospital-related transmission was suspected if a cluster of health professionals or hospitalized patients in the same wards became infected and a possible source of infection could be tracked.
32031570,Of 138 hospitalized patients with NCIP, the median age was 56 years (interquartile range, 42-68; range, 22-92 years) and 75 (54.3%) were men.
32031570,Hospital-associated transmission was suspected as the presumed mechanism of infection for affected health professionals (40 [29%]) and hospitalized patients (17 [12.3%]).
32031570,Common symptoms included fever (136 [98.6%]), fatigue (96 [69.6%]), and dry cough (82 [59.4%]).
32031570,Lymphopenia (lymphocyte count, 0.8 × 109/L [interquartile range {IQR}, 0.6-1.1]) occurred in 97 patients (70.3%), prolonged prothrombin time (13.0 seconds [IQR, 12.3-13.7]) in 80 patients (58%), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (261 U/L [IQR, 182-403]) in 55 patients (39.9%).
32031570,Chest computed tomographic scans showed bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs of all patients.
32031570,Most patients received antiviral therapy (oseltamivir, 124 [89.9%]), and many received antibacterial therapy (moxifloxacin, 89 [64.4%]; ceftriaxone, 34 [24.6%]; azithromycin, 25 [18.1%]) and glucocorticoid therapy (62 [44.9%]).
32031570,Thirty-six patients (26.1%) were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) because of complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (22 [61.1%]), arrhythmia (16 [44.4%]), and shock (11 [30.6%]).
32031570,The median time from first symptom to dyspnea was 5.0 days, to hospital admission was 7.0 days, and to ARDS was 8.0 days.
32031570,Patients treated in the ICU (n = 36), compared with patients not treated in the ICU (n = 102), were older (median age, 66 years vs 51 years), were more likely to have underlying comorbidities (26 [72.2%] vs 38 [37.3%]), and were more likely to have dyspnea (23 [63.9%] vs 20 [19.6%]), and anorexia (24 [66.7%] vs 31 [30.4%]).
32031570,Of the 36 cases in the ICU, 4 (11.1%) received high-flow oxygen therapy, 15 (41.7%) received noninvasive ventilation, and 17 (47.2%) received invasive ventilation (4 were switched to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation).
32031570,As of February 3, 47 patients (34.1%) were discharged and 6 died (overall mortality, 4.3%), but the remaining patients are still hospitalized.
32031570,Among those discharged alive (n = 47), the median hospital stay was 10 days (IQR, 7.0-14.0).
32031570,In this single-center case series of 138 hospitalized patients with confirmed NCIP in Wuhan, China, presumed hospital-related transmission of 2019-nCoV was suspected in 41% of patients, 26% of patients received ICU care, and mortality was 4.3%.
32033513,the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China publish the guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection (trial version 5) .
32033513,With the awareness and understanding of the disease, the guidelines have been revised for recognize, treat, and prevent diseases.

32034659,Since the outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus infection (2019-nCoV) in Wuhan City, China, by January 30, 2020, a total of 9692 confirmed cases and 15,238 suspected cases have been reported around 31 provinces or cities in China.
32034659,Among the confirmed cases, 1527 were severe cases, 171 had recovered and been discharged at home, and 213 died.
32034659,And among these cases, a total of 28 children aged from 1 month to 17 years have been reported in China.
32034659,For standardizing prevention and management of 2019-nCoV infections in children, we called up an experts' committee to formulate this experts' consensus statement.
32034659,This statement is based on the Novel Coronavirus Infection Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Standards (the fourth edition) (National Health Committee) and other previous diagnosis and treatment strategies for pediatric virus infections.
32034659,The present consensus statement summarizes current strategies on diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of 2019-nCoV infection in children.
32035428,At present, the prevention and treatment of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in China has reached a critical stage.
32035428,It is extremely important to disinfect ophthalmic examination instruments and protect ophthalmic medical care during the epidemic period to reduce cross-infection in clinical practice and reduce the infection risk of ophthalmic medical staff. <i>(Chin J Ophthalmol, 2020, 56: 0001)</i>.
32035428,目前我国防治2019新型冠状病毒（2019-nCoV）疫情的工作已经到了关键时期，做好疫情期间眼科检查器具消毒及眼科医务人员的防护工作，对于减少医院交叉感染，共同抗击疫情极为重要。
32035428,本文对在疫区的眼科工作经验进行总结，为眼科医师开展相应的临床工作提供参考。
32035428,<i>（中华眼科杂志，2020，56：0001）</i>.
32037389,Pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is continuously and rapidly circulating at present.
32037389,No effective antiviral treatment has been verified thus far.
32037389,We report here the clinical characteristics and therapeutic procedure for four patients with mild or severe 2019-nCoV pneumonia admitted to Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center.
32037389,All the patients were given antiviral treatment including lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra<sup>®</sup>), arbidol, and Shufeng Jiedu Capsule (SFJDC, a traditional Chinese medicine) and other necessary support care.
32037389,After treatment, three patients gained significant improvement in pneumonia associated symptoms, two of whom were confirmed 2019-nCoV negative and discharged, and one of whom was virus negative at the first test.
32037389,The remaining patient with severe pneumonia had shown signs of improvement by the cutoff date for data collection.
32037389,Results obtained in the current study may provide clues for treatment of 2019-nCoV pneumonia.
32037389,The efficacy of antiviral treatment including lopinavir/ritonavir, arbidol, and SFJDC warrants further verification in future study.
32040667,With the expanding use of molecular assays, viral pathogens are increasingly recognized among critically ill adult patients with community-acquired severe respiratory illness; studies have detected respiratory viral infections (RVIs) in 17-53% of such patients.
32040667,In addition, novel pathogens including zoonotic coronaviruses like the agents causing Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019 nCoV) are still being identified.
32040667,Patients with severe RVIs requiring ICU care present typically with hypoxemic respiratory failure.
32040667,Oseltamivir is the most widely used neuraminidase inhibitor for treatment of influenza; data suggest that early use is associated with reduced mortality in critically ill patients with influenza.
32040667,At present, there are no antiviral therapies of proven efficacy for other severe RVIs.
32040667,Several adjunctive pharmacologic interventions have been studied for their immunomodulatory effects, including macrolides, corticosteroids, cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, sirolimus, statins, anti-influenza immune plasma, and vitamin C, but none is recommended at present in severe RVIs.
32040667,Evidence-based supportive care is the mainstay for management of severe respiratory viral infection.
32040667,Non-invasive ventilation in patients with severe RVI causing acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and pneumonia is associated with a high likelihood of transition to invasive ventilation.
32040667,Limited existing knowledge highlights the need for data regarding supportive care and adjunctive pharmacologic therapy that is specific for critically ill patients with severe RVI.
32040667,There is a need for more pragmatic and efficient designs to test different therapeutics both individually and in combination.
32044814,A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) causing an outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, Hubei province of China was isolated in January 2020.
32044814,This study aims to investigate its epidemiologic history, and analyze the clinical characteristics, treatment regimens, and prognosis of patients infected with 2019-nCoV during this outbreak.
32044814,Clinical data from 137 2019-nCoV-infected patients admitted to the respiratory departments of the respiratory departments of nine tertiary hospitals in Hubei province from December 30, 2019 to January 24, 2020 were retrospectively collected, including general status, clinical manifestations, laboratory test results, imaging characteristics, and treatment regimens.
32044814,None of the 137 patients (61 males, 76 females, aged 20-83 years, median age 57 years) had a definite history of exposure to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market.
32044814,Major initial symptoms included fever (112/137, 81.8%), coughing (66/137, 48.2%), and muscle pain or fatigue (44/137, 32.1%), with other, less typical initial symptoms observed at low frequency, including heart palpitations, diarrhea, and headache.
32044814,Nearly 80% of the patients had normal or decreased white blood cell counts, and 72.3% (99/137) had lymphocytopenia.
32044814,Lung involvement was present in all cases, with most chest computed tomography scans showing lesions in multiple lung lobes, some of which were dense; ground-glass opacity co-existed with consolidation shadows or cord-like shadows.
32044814,Given the lack of effective drugs, treatment focused on symptomatic and respiratory support.
32044814,Immunoglobulin G was delivered to some critically ill patients according to their conditions.
32044814,Systemic corticosteroid treatment did not show significant benefits.
32044814,Notably, early respiratory support facilitated disease recovery and improved prognosis.
32044814,The risk of death was primarily associated with age, underlying chronic diseases, and median interval from the appearance of initial symptoms to dyspnea.
32044814,The majority of patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia present with fever as the first symptom, and most of them still showed typical manifestations of viral pneumonia on chest imaging.
32044814,Middle-aged and elderly patients with underlying comorbidities are susceptible to respiratory failure and may have a poorer prognosis.
32048163,The outbreak of the 2019-nCoV infection began in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei province, and rapidly spread to many provinces in China as well as other countries.
32048163,Here we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics, as well as potential biomarkers for predicting disease severity in 2019-nCoV-infected patients in Shenzhen, China.
32048163,All 12 cases of the 2019-nCoV-infected patients developed pneumonia and half of them developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
32048163,The most common laboratory abnormalities were hypoalbuminemia, lymphopenia, decreased percentage of lymphocytes (LYM) and neutrophils (NEU), elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and decreased CD8 count.
32048163,The viral load of 2019-nCoV detected from patient respiratory tracts was positively linked to lung disease severity.
32048163,ALB, LYM, LYM (%), LDH, NEU (%), and CRP were highly correlated to the acute lung injury.
32048163,Age, viral load, lung injury score, and blood biochemistry indexes, albumin (ALB), CRP, LDH, LYM (%), LYM, and NEU (%), may be predictors of disease severity.
32048163,Moreover, the Angiotensin II level in the plasma sample from 2019-nCoV infected patients was markedly elevated and linearly associated to viral load and lung injury.
32048163,Our results suggest a number of potential diagnosis biomarkers and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) drugs for potential repurposing treatment of 2019-nCoV infection.
32049687,In late December 2019 a previous unidentified coronavirus, currently named as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), emerged from Wuhan, China and resulted in a formidable outbreak in many cities in China and expanding globally, including Thailand, Republic of Korea, Japan, USA, Philippines, Viet Nam, and our country (as of 2/6/2020 at least 25 countries).
32049687,The disease is officially named as the Severe Specific Contagious Pneumonia (SSCP) in 1/15/2019 and is a notifiable communicable disease of the 5 category by the Taiwan CDC, the Ministry of Health.
32049687,SSCP is a potential zoonotic disease with low to moderate (estimated 2-5%) mortality rate.
32049687,Person-to-person transmission may occur through droplet or contact transmission and jeopardized first-line healthcare workers if lack of stringent infection control or no proper personal protective equipment available.
32049687,Currently, there is no definite treatment for SSCP although some drugs are under investigation.
32049687,To promptly identify patients and prevent further spreading, physicians should be aware of travel or contact history for patients with compatible symptoms.
32051071,Since December 2019, the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection has been prevalent in China.
32051071,Due to immaturity of immune function and the possibility of mother-fetal vertical transmission, neonates are particularly susceptible to 2019-nCoV.
32051071,The perinatal-neonatal departments should cooperate closely and take integrated approaches, and the neonatal intensive care unit should prepare the emergency plan for 2019-nCoV infection as far as possible, so as to ensure the optimal management and treatment of potential victims.
32051071,According to the latest 2019-nCoV national management plan and the actual situation, the Working Group for the Prevention and Control of Neonatal 2019-nCoV Infection in the Perinatal Period of the Editorial Committee of Chinese Journal of Contemporary Pediatrics puts forward recommendations for the prevention and control of 2019-nCoV infection in neonates.
32051072,2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection has been spreading in China since December 2019.
32051072,Neonates are presumably the high-risk population susceptible to 2019-nCoV due to immature immune function.
32051072,The neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) should be prepared for 2019-nCoV infections as far as possible.
32051072,The emergency response plan enables the efficient response capability of NICU.
32051072,During the epidemic of 2019-nCoV, the emergency response plan for the NICU should be based on the actual situation, including diagnosis, isolation, and treatment, as well as available equipment and staffing, and take into account the psychosocial needs of the families and neonatal care staff.
32051073,Since December 2019, a cluster of patients have been diagnosed to be infected with 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Wuhan, China.
32051073,The epidemic has been spreading to other areas of the country and abroad.
32051073,A few cases have progressed rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome and/or multiple organ function failure.
32051073,The epidemiological survey has indicated that the general population is susceptible to 2019-nCoV.
32051073,A total of 14 children (6 months to 14 years of age, including 5 cases in Wuhan) have been confirmed to be infected with 2019-nCoV in China so far.
32051073,In order to further standardize and enhance the clinical management of 2019-nCoV infection in children, reduce the incidence, and decrease the number of severe cases, we have formulated this diagnosis and treatment recommendation according to the recent information at home and abroad.
32052466,An outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19 or 2019-CoV) infection has posed significant threats to international health and the economy.
32052466,In the absence of treatment for this virus, there is an urgent need to find alternative methods to control the spread of disease.
32052466,Here, we have conducted an online search for all treatment options related to coronavirus infections as well as some RNA-virus infection and we have found that general treatments, coronavirus-specific treatments, and antiviral treatments should be useful in fighting COVID-19.
32052466,We suggest that the nutritional status of each infected patient should be evaluated before the administration of general treatments and the current children's RNA-virus vaccines including influenza vaccine should be immunized for uninfected people and health care workers.
32052466,In addition, convalescent plasma should be given to COVID-19 patients if it is available.
32052466,In conclusion, we suggest that all the potential interventions be implemented to control the emerging COVID-19 if the infection is uncontrollable.
32054787,The continued emergence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) cases with a high case fatality rate stresses the need for the availability of effective antiviral treatments.
32054787,Remdesivir (GS-5734) effectively inhibited MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) replication in vitro, and showed efficacy against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV in a mouse model.
32054787,Here, we tested the efficacy of prophylactic and therapeutic remdesivir treatment in a nonhuman primate model of MERS-CoV infection, the rhesus macaque.
32054787,Prophylactic remdesivir treatment initiated 24 h prior to inoculation completely prevented MERS-CoV-induced clinical disease, strongly inhibited MERS-CoV replication in respiratory tissues, and prevented the formation of lung lesions.
32054787,Therapeutic remdesivir treatment initiated 12 h postinoculation also provided a clear clinical benefit, with a reduction in clinical signs, reduced virus replication in the lungs, and decreased presence and severity of lung lesions.
32054787,The data presented here support testing of the efficacy of remdesivir treatment in the context of a MERS clinical trial.
32054787,It may also be considered for a wider range of coronaviruses, including the currently emerging novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV.
32057209,The New Coronavirus Pneumonia (NCP, also named as COVID-19 by WHO on Feb 11 2020, is now causing a severe public health emergency in China since.
32057209,The number of diagnosed cases is more than 40,000 until the submission of this manuscript.
32057209,Coronavirus has caused several epidemic situations world widely, but the present contagious disease caused by 2019 new Coronavirus is unprecedentedly fulminating.
32057209,The published cohorts of 2019 new Coronavirus (n-Cov) are single-center studies, or retrospective studies.
32057209,We here share the therapeutic experiences of NCP treatment with literature review.
32057209,Combination of Ribavirin and Interferon-α is recommended by the 5(th) edition National Health Commission's Regimen (Revised Edition) because of the effect on MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome), and the effectiveness of Lopinavir/Ritonavir and Remdisivir needs to be confirmed by randomized controlled trial (RCT), given the situation of no specific antivirus drug on NCP is unavailable.
32057209,Systemic glucocorticosteroid is recommended as a short term use (1~2 mg.kg(-1).d(-1), 3~5d ) by the 5(th) edition National Health Commission's Regimen (Revised Edition) yet RCTs are expected to confirm the effectiveness.
32057209,Inappropriate application of antibiotics should be avoided, especially the combination of broad-spectrum antibiotics, for the NCP is not often complicated with bacterial infection.
32057209,新型冠状病毒肺炎（new coronavirus pneumonia，NCP）正在中国引起严重疫情，截至发稿之日，全国确诊人数已逾4万。
32057209,冠状病毒已经在全世界范围内引起数次疫情，但此次疫情的来势之迅猛及传染性之强前所未有。
32057209,我们对引起此次疫情的病原体-2019新型冠状病毒知之甚少，目前在国际上发表的临床研究文章或为单中心研究，或为回顾性分析。
32057209,我们在此结合在新冠肺炎一线的救治体会及相关发表的研究，给大家分享新冠肺炎的治疗经验。
32057209,抗病毒药物方面，目前仍无特效药物，利巴韦林和干扰素联合用药由于其治疗中东呼吸综合征（MERS）有效，仍被我国新冠肺炎诊疗方案推荐；洛匹那韦/利托那韦和瑞德西韦的疗效有待随机临床试验（randomized controlled trial，RCT）评价；糖皮质激素的短期应用（1~2 mg.kg(-1).d(-1)，3~5 d）被我国诊疗方案推荐，但仍需RCT进一步证实；本次新冠肺炎合并细菌感染较少，应当避免盲目使用抗菌药物，尤其避免联用广谱抗菌药物。.
32060789,Based on the announcement of the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2018, the Wuhan pneumonia caused by an unknown etiology should be recognized as the first Disease X.
32060789,Later, the pathogen was identified to be a novel coronavirus denoted 2019-nCoV, which has 79.5% and 96% whole genome sequence identify to SARS-CoV and bat SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV-RaTG13), respectively, suggesting its potential bat origin.
32060789,With high human-to-human transmission rate (R0), 2019-nCoV has quickly spread in China and other countries, resulting in 34,953 confirmed cases and 725 deaths as of 8 February 2020, thus calling for urgent development of therapeutics and prophylactics.
32060789,Here we suggest renaming 2019-nCoV as &quot;transmissible acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (TARS-CoV)&quot; and briefly review the advancement of research and development of neutralizing antibodies and vaccines targeting the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and viral fusion inhibitors targeting the heptad repeat 1 (HR1) domain in spike protein of 2019-nCoV.
32061198,The novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) infected patients by binding human ACE2, leading to severe pneumonia and highly mortality rate in patients.
32061198,At present, there is no definite and effective treatment for COVID-19.
32061198,ACE2 plays an important role in the RAS, and the imbalance between ACE/Ang II/AT1R pathway and ACE2/Ang (1-7)/Mas receptor pathway in the RAS system will lead to multi-system inflammation.
32061198,Increased ACE and Ang II are poor prognostic factors for severe pneumonia.
32061198,Animal studies have shown that RAS inhibitors could effectively relieve symptoms of acute severe pneumonia and respiratory failure.
32061198,The binding of COVID-19 and ACE2 resulted in the exhaustion of ACE2, and then ACE2/Ang (1-7)/Mas receptor pathway was inhibited.
32061198,The balance of the RAS system was broken, and this would lead to the exacerbation of acute severe pneumonia.
32061198,Therefore, we speculate that ACEI and AT1R inhibitors could be used in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia under the condition of controlling blood pressure, and might reduce the pulmonary inflammatory response and mortality.
32061198,新型冠状病毒通过与人体血管紧张素转化酶2（ACE2）结合感染产生重症肺炎，传染性强，病死率高，目前无确切有效的治疗方式。
32061198,ACE2是肾素-血管紧张素系统（RAS）的重要组成部分，RAS系统中ACE/Ang II/AT1R通路与ACE2/Ang (1-7)/Mas受体通路失衡将导致多系统炎症。
32061198,ACE和Ang II升高是重症肺炎的不良预后因素。
32061198,动物实验结果显示，应用RAS抑制剂可以有效缓解急性重症肺炎症状，缓解呼吸衰竭。
32061198,新型冠状病毒与ACE2的结合导致ACE2耗竭，ACE2/Ang (1-7)/Mas受体通路受到抑制，RAS系统失衡，使新型冠状病毒肺炎患者病死率升高。
32061198,因此，在控制血压的情况下，对新型冠状病毒肺炎患者应用ACEI及AT1R抑制剂，有可能减轻患者肺部炎症反应，降低患者病死率。.
32061200,<b>Objective:</b> To explore imaging characteristics of children with 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection. <b>Methods:</b> A retrospective analysis was performed on clinical data and chest CT images of 15 children diagnosed with 2019-nCoV.

32061200,The distribution and morphology of pulmonary lesions on chest CT images were analyzed. <b>Results:</b> Among the 15 children, there were 5 males and 10 females, aged from 4 to 14 years old.
32061200,Five of the 15 children were febrile and 10 were asymptomatic on first visit.
32061200,The first nasal or pharyngeal swab samples in all the 15 cases were positive for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid.
32061200,For their first chest CT images, 6 patients had no lesions, while 9 patients had pulmonary inflammation lesions.
32061200,Seven cases of small nodular ground glass opacities and 2 cases of speckled ground glass opacities were found.
32061200,After 3 to 5 days of treatment, 2019-nCoV nucleic acid in a second respiratory sample turned negative in 6 cases.
32061200,Among them, chest CT images showed less lesions in 2 cases, no lesion in 3 cases, and no improvement in 1 case.
32061200,Other 9 cases were still positive in a second nucleic acid test.
32061200,Six patients showed similar chest CT inflammation, while 3 patients had new lesions, which were all small nodular ground glass opacities. <b>Conclusions:</b> The early chest CT images of children with 2019-nCoV infection are mostly small nodular ground glass opacities.
32061200,The clinical symptoms of children with 2019-nCoV infection are nonspecific.
32061200,Dynamic reexamination of chest CT and nucleic acid are important. <b>目的：</b> 探讨儿童新型冠状病毒感染的CT影像学特征。

32061200,<b>结论：</b> 儿童感染新型冠状病毒临床症状不典型，其早期影像学多表现为小结节状磨玻璃影。
32061200,对于儿童新型冠状病毒感染胸部CT及病毒核酸动态复查很重要。.
32064854,<b>Objective:</b> To analyze the current situation of the knowledge, attitudes and practice about Novelcoronavirus pneumonia (NCP) of the residents in Anhui Province. <b>Methods:</b> Anonymous network sampling survey was carried out with an electronic questionnaire that designed by the questionnaire star, and a total of 4016 subjects from Anhui province were investigated.
32064854,The content of the survey includes that the basic information of subjects,the residents' knowledge, attitudes and practice about NCP, as well as their satisfaction with the prevention and control measures adopted by the government and health authorities and the suggestions on future prevention.
32064854,The questionnaire doesn't involve any privacy information, and all questions were mandatory to ensure the response rate. <b>Results:</b> The <i>M</i> (<i>P</i>(25), <i>P</i>(75)) age the 4016 subjects was 21 (19, 24), and the ranging from 7 to 80 years old.
32064854,The number of males was1431(35.6%).
32064854,Social networking tools such as WeChat and QQ were the main sources of epidemic information for residents (97.8%, 3 929 respondents).
32064854,Residents have a high awareness rate of the main symptoms, transmission routes, using of masks, hand washing and treatment information of NCP, while a low awareness rate of the atypical symptoms.
32064854,92.6% of the subjects (<i>n</i>=3 720) think that the outbreak was scary.
32064854,In terms of psychological behavior scores, the results showed that female (9.38±4.81), the urban (9.37±5.02) and the medical workers (10.79±5.19) had a poorer mental health than the male (8.45±5.00) , the rural (8.71±4.75) and the non-medical workers (the students: 8.85±4.83; public institude workers: 9.02±5.08; others: 8.97±5.39) (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05).
32064854,71.9% of the residents (<i>n</i>=2 887)were satisfied with the local epidemic control measures.

32064854,<b>结论：</b> 安徽省居民对NCP相关的知识、态度和行为情况较好，但需进一步加强社区宣传、居民心理健康维护和学生健康教育等工作力度。.
32064855,The epidemiological history and clinical characteristics of 7 cases of COVID-19 and 1 case of close contact in the first family aggregation epidemic of COVID-19 in Gansu Province were analyzed.
32064855,The first patient A developed on January 22, 2020, with a history of residence in Wuhan, and confirmed severe cases of NCP on January 24, 2020; patient B, on January 23, 2020, diagnosed on January 31, severe cases; patient C, asymptomatic, diagnosed on January 27; patient D, asymptomatic, diagnosed on January 27; patient E, on January 24, diagnosed on January 28; patient F, asymptomatic, diagnosed on January 31; Patient G was asymptomatic and was diagnosed on January 31.
32064855,In close contact, H was asymptomatic, PCR test was negative and asymptomatic, and he was discharged early.
32064855,Among the 7 patients, 1 case died of (B) aggravation, and the other patients' condition was effectively controlled after active treatment.
32064855,Except for the discharged cases, 5 cases were positive for COVID-19 specific IgM antibody and 1 case was negative.
32064855,In this clustering outbreak, 4 patients remained asymptomatic, but PCR and IgM antibodies were positive, indicating that asymptomatic patients may be the key point to control the epidemic.
32064855,Specific IgM antibody screening for patients whose pharyngeal swab nucleic acid test is negative but with ground glass-like lung lesions is very important for early detection and early isolation.
32064855,分析甘肃省首起新型冠状病毒（COVID-19）肺炎（NCP）家族聚集性疫情中7例COVID-19患者及1例密切接触者的流行病学史及临床特征。
32064855,首例患者A于2020年1月22日发病，有武汉居留史，1月24日确诊NCP重症病例；患者B，2020年1月23日发病，1月31日确诊，重症病例；患者C无症状，1月27日确诊；患者D无症状，1月27日确诊；患者E，1月24日发病，1月28日确诊；患者F无症状，1月31日确诊；患者G无症状，1月31日确诊；密切接触者H无症状，PCR连续检测阴性，无症状，提前出院。
32064855,7例患者中，1例（B）加重死亡，其他患者经过积极救治，病情均得到有效控制。
32064855,除了出院病例外，有5例COVID-19特异IgM抗体检测阳性，1例检测阴性。
32064855,此次聚集性暴发，4例患者始终无症状，但PCR和IgM抗体检测阳性，说明无症状者可能是此次控制此次疫情的关键节点，对于咽拭子核酸检测阴性但明确有毛玻璃样肺部病变的患者进行特异性IgM抗体筛查对病例早发现早隔离至关重要。.
32065055,The newly identified 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has caused more than 11,900 laboratory-confirmed human infections, including 259 deaths, posing a serious threat to human health.
32065055,Currently, however, there is no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine.
32065055,Considering the relatively high identity of receptor-binding domain (RBD) in 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV, it is urgent to assess the cross-reactivity of anti-SARS CoV antibodies with 2019-nCoV spike protein, which could have important implications for rapid development of vaccines and therapeutic antibodies against 2019-nCoV.
32065055,Here, we report for the first time that a SARS-CoV-specific human monoclonal antibody, CR3022, could bind potently with 2019-nCoV RBD (KD of 6.3 nM).
32065055,The epitope of CR3022 does not overlap with the ACE2 binding site within 2019-nCoV RBD.
32065055,These results suggest that CR3022 may have the potential to be developed as candidate therapeutics, alone or in combination with other neutralizing antibodies, for the prevention and treatment of 2019-nCoV infections.
32065055,Interestingly, some of the most potent SARS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies (e.g. m396, CR3014) that target the ACE2 binding site of SARS-CoV failed to bind 2019-nCoV spike protein, implying that the difference in the RBD of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV has a critical impact for the cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibodies, and that it is still necessary to develop novel monoclonal antibodies that could bind specifically to 2019-nCoV RBD.
32065348,Since December 2019, an outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, and rapidly spread to almost all parts of China.
32065348,This was followed by prevention programs recommending Chinese medicine (CM) for the prevention.
32065348,In order to provide evidence for CM recommendations, we reviewed ancient classics and human studies.
32065348,Historical records on prevention and treatment of infections in CM classics, clinical evidence of CM on the prevention of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and H1N1 influenza, and CM prevention programs issued by health authorities in China since the COVID-19 outbreak were retrieved from different databases and websites till 12 February, 2020.
32065348,Research evidence included data from clinical trials, cohort or other population studies using CM for preventing contagious respiratory virus diseases.
32065348,The use of CM to prevent epidemics of infectious diseases was traced back to ancient Chinese practice cited in Huangdi's Internal Classic (Huang Di Nei Jing) where preventive effects were recorded.
32065348,There were 3 studies using CM for prevention of SARS and 4 studies for H1N1 influenza.
32065348,None of the participants who took CM contracted SARS in the 3 studies.
32065348,The infection rate of H1N1 influenza in the CM group was significantly lower than the non-CM group (relative risk 0.36, 95% confidence interval 0.24-0.52; n=4).
32065348,For prevention of COVID-19, 23 provinces in China issued CM programs.
32065348,The main principles of CM use were to tonify qi to protect from external pathogens, disperse wind and discharge heat, and resolve dampness.
32065348,The most frequently used herbs included Radix astragali (Huangqi), Radix glycyrrhizae (Gancao), Radix saposhnikoviae (Fangfeng), Rhizoma Atractylodis Macrocephalae (Baizhu), Lonicerae Japonicae Flos (Jinyinhua), and Fructus forsythia (Lianqiao).
32065348,Based on historical records and human evidence of SARS and H1N1 influenza prevention, Chinese herbal formula could be an alternative approach for prevention of COVID-19 in high-risk population.
32065348,Prospective, rigorous population studies are warranted to confirm the potential preventive effect of CM.
32072919,This guideline is applicable to the health protection requirements of large indoor stadiums which are reconstructed as treatment sites for the Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (NPC) patients with mild symptoms during the outbreak.
32072919,Focusing on the health emergency scenario of severe virus infectious diseases and atypical places where NPC patients with mild symptom gather, from perspectives of functional zones, hygiene facilities, personal protection, and management system, health risk protection recommendations and countermeasures are comprehensively proposed to mainly protect staffs and surrounding environment.
32072919,The implementation of this guideline will provide technique support for emergency requirements of indoor stadiums reconstructed as mobile cabin hospitals.
32072919,本指南适用于新型冠状病毒肺炎疫情期间，大型室内体育场馆改造为新型冠状病毒肺炎轻症患者的治疗场所的卫生防护要求。
32072919,围绕重大病毒性传染病卫生应急情景，针对新冠肺炎轻症患者聚集的非典型场所，以工作人员和周边环境为主要保护对象，从功能分区、卫生设施、个人防护、管理制度等方面提出综合性的健康风险防护建议及应对措施。
32072919,本指南的实施将为室内体育场改建为方舱医院的应急需求提供技术支持。.
32074550,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) virus is spreading rapidly, and scientists are endeavoring to discover drugs for its efficacious treatment in China.
32074550,Chloroquine phosphate, an old drug for treatment of malaria, is shown to have apparent efficacy and acceptable safety against COVID-19 associated pneumonia in multicenter clinical trials conducted in China.
32074550,The drug is recommended to be included in the next version of the Guidelines for the Prevention, Diagnosis, and Treatment of Pneumonia Caused by COVID-19 issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China for treatment of COVID-19 infection in larger populations in the future.
32074786,The outbreak of the novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) has become a public health emergency in China.
32074786,Chinese authorities and health agencies had devoted great efforts to control this disease.
32074786,As surgeons specialized in the treatment of gastrointestinal tumors, we should always be aware of the prevention for NCP and incorporate this awareness into every detail of clinical practice.
32074786,For the patients with gastrointestinal tumors, pre-admission screening should be done in order to rule out NCP.
32074786,Real-time RT-PCR panel and chest CT scan should be conducted for patients with fever (&gt;37.3℃), travel history to Hubei Province within 14 days, or contact history with residents from Wuhan district within 14 days.
32074786,Prevention measures for both medical staffs and the screen-negative admitted patients should also be enhanced because false negative is possible.
32074786,Medical instruments should be properly discarded or disinfected according to standardized procedures established by the local center for disease control and prevention (CDC).
32074786,Surgical operation should be reduced at a minimal level to prevent cross infection in this special period.Surgical intervention for benign tumor should be postponed.
32074786,For malignant tumor, multidisciplinary therapy (MDT) is recommended and non-surgical anti-tumor therapy should be selected with higher priority.
32074786,Neoadjuvant therapy is highly recommended for gastrointestinal cancer at advanced stages that meet the indications of NCCN guideline (gastric cancer T stage ≥ 2/rectal cancer T stage ≥ 3/unresectable colon cancer).
32074786,Gastric or esophagogastricjunction (EGJ) malignant tumor with obstruction can be managed with gastric tube decompression or stent placement to relieve the symptoms.
32074786,Transnasal enteral feeding tube intubation/percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy could be adopted to ensure enteral nutrition supply.
32074786,For colorectal malignancy with simple intestinal obstruction, stent placement can achieve a high success rate, which not only helps avoid emergency surgery, but also creates a better condition for subsequent surgery.
32074786,Transcatheter arterial embolization for hemostasis is an alternative choice for gastrointestinal tumor with bleeding.
32074786,However, emergency operation still must be performed for patients with acute uncontrolled bleeding, obstruction or after other alternative treatment measures fail.
32074786,All cases with suspicious or confirmed with NCP must be reported to the local CDC department.
32074786,All invasive intervention must be performed in a designated isolation area.
32074786,Tertiary prevention measure must be adopted for all anesthetists with additional face mask or medical goggle protection to prevent respiratory droplet transmission.
32074786,Preventive enterostomy is preferable in lower digestive tract surgery.
32074786,Thoroughly disinfecting the operating room after surgery is necessary.
32074786,Fever after surgery must be carefully differentiated whether it's caused by post-surgery abdominal infection/inflammation or NCP.
32074786,Single-room isolation and related examinations should be performed according to the standard procedures.
32074786,We believe that with the unprecedentedly joint efforts of doctors and patients, we will eventually win this war against NCP.
32074786,当前，我国新型冠状病毒肺炎（简称&quot;新冠肺炎&quot;）的疫情形势严峻，全国医护人员都义不容辞地肩负起了抗击疫情的重任。
32074786,作为胃肠外科医师，我们应积极学习新冠肺炎的相关知识，科学应对，把防疫的意识渗透到临床工作的每个诊疗细节和临床操作中去。
32074786,对于胃肠肿瘤患者，首先应做好入院前筛查，肺部CT应作为常规检查项目。
32074786,经过严密筛查的患者入院后术前检查时需加强防护措施，包括医护人员的自我防护；诊疗过的器械或物品应妥善丢弃，或按规范流程进行消毒，严防交叉感染。
32074786,对于胃肠道良性肿瘤，如无合并明显出血或梗阻，不建议在这个非常时期进行手术治疗，可待疫情高峰期过后择期手术。
32074786,对于进展期胃肠恶性肿瘤患者，建议经过多学科联合会诊（MDT），如果符合新辅助治疗指征，应优先选择新辅助治疗而推迟手术。
32074786,胃肠道肿瘤合并梗阻或出血的病例可考虑通过内镜或介入治疗解除梗阻或止血；若肿瘤合并出血保守治疗及内镜治疗无效，可尝试于介入下进行选择性血管栓塞；合并梗阻但没有合并腹膜炎者，肠道支架置入具有较高的解除梗阻成功率，大部分患者可免于急诊手术。
32074786,对于胃窦肿瘤合并胃潴留、食管胃结合部肿瘤合并食管梗阻的患者，可留置胃管和空肠营养管，进行减压和营养支持以缓解症状，为限期手术创造更好的身体情况。
32074786,对于确实需要手术、且疑似或确诊新冠肺炎患者，在向医院、疾控中心进行报备的前提下，最好转至定点医院诊治，或于专门隔离病区进行术前准备、专门的通道进行转运以及专门的感染手术室进行手术；麻醉医师在三级预防的基础上注意配戴防护面罩进行气管插管及拔管，以防飞沫喷溅。
32074786,对于下消化道手术，应更积极行预防性肠造口。
32074786,术后对手术间进行彻底消毒。
32074786,对于手术后发热患者，应与新冠肺炎相鉴别，若伴咳嗽、咳痰者，应按疑似新冠肺炎病例的标准进行单间隔离和相关检查。
32074786,相信通过医患双方的共同努力，取得这场防疫战争的胜利将指日可待！.
32075365,At the end of December 2019, a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) caused an outbreak in Wuhan, and has quickly spread to all provinces in China and 26 other countries around the world, leading to a serious situation for epidemic prevention.
32075365,So far, there is still no specific medicine.
32075365,Previous studies have shown that chloroquine phosphate (chloroquine) had a wide range of antiviral effects, including anti-coronavirus.
32075365,Here we found that treating the patients diagnosed as novel coronavirus pneumonia with chloroquine might improve the success rate of treatment, shorten hospital stay and improve patient outcome.
32075365,In order to guide and regulate the use of chloroquine in patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia, the multicenter collaboration group of Department of Science and Technology of Guangdong Province and Health Commission of Guangdong Province for chloroquine in the treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia developed this expert consensus after extensive discussion.
32075365,It recommended chloroquine phosphate tablet, 500mg twice per day for 10 days for patients diagnosed as mild, moderate and severe cases of novel coronavirus pneumonia and without contraindications to chloroquine.
32075365,自2019年12月，武汉暴发了一种新型冠状病毒病（COVID-19），迅速蔓延至我国各省市及全球26个国家，防疫情势十分严峻。
32075365,但是目前尚无特效药物。
32075365,磷酸氯喹（简称氯喹）具有广泛抗病毒及抗冠状病毒的作用，临床研究结果显示氯喹或可提高新型冠状病毒肺炎患者的救治成功率、缩短住院时间及改善预后。
32075365,为指引并规范氯喹在新型冠状病毒肺炎中的使用，广东省科技厅、广东省卫生健康委氯喹治疗新冠状病毒肺炎多中心协作组经充分讨论后，制定本专家共识,对确诊为新型冠状病毒肺炎轻型、普通型和重型患者，排除氯喹禁忌证后，可以使用磷酸氯喹片每次500 mg，2次/d，疗程10 d。.
32077440,In December 2019, China diagnosed the first patient with 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), and the following development of the epidemic had a huge impact on China and the whole world.
32077440,For patients with lung occupying lesions, the whole process of diagnosis and treatment can not be carried out as usual due to the epidemic.
32077440,For thoracic surgeons, the timing of surgical intervention should be very carefully considered.
32077440,All thoracic surgeons in China should work together to develop the proper procedures for the diagnosis and treatment in this special situation, and continuously update the recommendations based on epidemic changes and further understanding of COVID-19.
32077440,Here, we only offer some preliminary suggestions based on our own knowledge for further reference and discussion.

32077441,Since late December 2019, an outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China has spread quickly nationwide.
32077441,With the spread of COVID-19, the routine clinical diagnosis and treatment for lung cancer patients has been disturbed.
32077441,Due to the systemic immunosuppressive of lung cancer patients caused by the malignancy and anticancer treatments, lung cancer patients are more susceptible to infection than healthy individuals.
32077441,Furthermore, patients with cancer had poorer prognosis from infection.
32077441,Lung cancer patients should be the priority group for COVID-19 prevention.
32077441,The protection provisions and control measures aiming to protect lung cancer patients from COVID-19 have been increasingly concerned.
32077441,During the COVID-19 outbreak period, it should be carefully differentiated for fever and respiratory symptoms for lung cancer patients receiving anti-tumor treatment, in order to evaluate the risk of COVID-19.
32077441,Moreover, it is necessary to carry out meticulous and individualized clinical management for lung cancer patients to effectively protect the patients from COVID-19.
32077441,【中文题目：新型冠状病毒肺炎疫情期间肺癌患者临床管理】 【中文摘要：自2019年12月底以来，湖北省武汉市陆续发现多例新型冠状病毒肺炎（简称：新冠肺炎，2019 novel coronavirus disease，COVID-19），并在全国范围内蔓延。
32077441,随着新冠肺炎疫情的蔓延，肺癌患者的常规医疗受到影响。
32077441,由于肺癌患者接受抗肿瘤治疗后免疫力低，合并感染后症状重，应是疫情防治的重点对象，肺癌患者对新冠肺炎的防范措施日益受到关注。
32077441,复杂严峻的新冠肺炎疫情下，接受抗肿瘤治疗的肺癌患者如出现发热及呼吸道症状，更需要仔细地进行鉴别诊断，评估新冠肺炎感染的风险。
32077441,对于肺癌患者，在新冠肺炎疫情期间，需要进行精细化和个体化的管理，最大程度地保护患者，有效防范新冠肺炎。】

32077660,<b>Objective:</b> To analyze the clinical characteristics of cases of novel coronavirus pneumonia and a preliminary study to explore the relationship between different clinical classification and liver damage. <b>Methods:</b> Consecutively confirmed novel coronavirus infection cases admitted to seven designated hospitals during January 23, 2020 to February 8, 2020 were included.
32077660,Clinical classification (mild, moderate, severe, and critical) was carried out according to the diagnosis and treatment program of novel coronavirus pneumonia (Trial Fifth Edition) issued by the National Health Commission.
32077660,The research data were analyzed using SPSS19.0 statistical software.
32077660,Quantitative data were expressed as median (interquartile range), and qualitative data were expressed as frequency and rate. <b>Results:</b> 32 confirmed cases that met the inclusion criteria were included. 28 cases were of mild or moderate type (87.50%), and four cases (12.50%) of severe or critical type.
32077660,Four cases (12.5%) were combined with one underlying disease (bronchial asthma, coronary heart disease, malignant tumor, chronic kidney disease), and one case (3.13%) was simultaneously combined with high blood pressure and malignant tumor.
32077660,The results of laboratory examination showed that the alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), albumin (ALB), and total bilirubin (TBil) for entire cohort were 26.98 (16.88 ~ 46.09) U/L and 24.75 (18.71 ~ 31.79) U/L, 39.00 (36.20 ~ 44.20) g/L and 16.40 (11.34- ~ 21.15) mmol/L, respectively.
32077660,ALT, AST, ALB and TBil of the mild or moderate subgroups were 22.75 (16.31- ~ 37.25) U/L, 23.63 (18.71 ~ 26.50) U/L, 39.70 (36.50 ~ 46.10) g/L, and 15.95 (11.34 ~ 20.83) mmol/L, respectively.

32077661,Definite evidence has shown that the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) could be transmitted from person to person, so far more than 1,700 bedside clinicians have been infected.
32077661,A lot of respiratory treatments for critically ill patients are deemed as high-risk factors for nosocomial transmission, such as intubation, manual ventilation by resuscitator, noninvasive ventilation, high-flow nasal cannula, bronchoscopy examination, suction and patient transportation, etc, due to its high possibility to cause or worsen the spread of the virus.
32077661,As such, we developed this consensus recommendations on all those high-risk treatments, based on the current evidence as well as the resource limitation in some areas, with the aim to reduce the nosocomial transmission and optimize the treatment for the COVID-19 pneumonia patients.
32077661,Those recommendations include: (1) Standard prevention and protection, and patient isolation; (2) Patient wearing mask during HFNC treatment; (3) Using dual limb ventilator with filters placed at the ventilator outlets, or using heat-moisture exchanger (HME) instead of heated humidification in single limb ventilator with HME placed between exhalation port and mask; avoid using mask with exhalation port on the mask; (4) Placing filter between resuscitator and mask or artificial airway; (5) For spontaneous breathing patients, placing mask for patients during bronchoscopy examination; for patients receiving noninvasive ventilation, using the special mask with bronchoscopy port to perform bronchoscopy; (6) Using sedation and paralytics during intubation, cuff pressure should be maintained between 25-30 cmH(2)O; (7) In-line suction catheter is recommended and it can be used for one week; (8) Dual-limb heated wire circuits are recommended and only changed with visible soiled; (9.
32077661,For patients who need breathing support during transportation, placing an HME between ventilator and patient; (10) PSV is recommended for implementing spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), avoid using T-piece to do SBT.
32077661,When tracheotomy patients are weaned from ventilator, HME should be used, avoid using T-piece or tracheostomy mask.
32077661,(11) Avoid unnecessary bronchial hygiene therapy; (12) For patients who need aerosol therapy, dry powder inhaler metered dose inhaler with spacer is recommended for spontaneous breathing patients; while vibrating mesh nebulizer is recommended for ventilated patients and additional filter is recommended to be placed at the expiratory port of ventilation during nebulization.
32077661,自首例新型冠状病毒肺炎确诊以来，已有大量人传人的病例，其中超过1700例医护人员遭受了感染。
32077661,对危重症患者进行呼吸治疗时有大量高危操作，例如气管插管、简易呼吸器辅助通气、无创正压通气、高流量鼻导管治疗、气管镜检查、吸痰以及转运等均可引起或加重患者气道内呼出病毒的大量传播。
32077661,因此，我们根据目前最佳证据以及国内现有条件制定了本防范建议，旨在降低医护人员感染风险的同时为患者提供最佳治疗。.
32078069,An ongoing outbreak of 2019-nCoV pneumonia was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei province, China at the end of 2019.
32078069,With the spread of the new coronavirus accelerating, person-to-person transmission in family homes or hospitals, and intercity spread of 2019-nCoV occurred.
32078069,At least 40,261 cases confirmed, 23,589 cases suspected, 909 cases death and 3444 cases cured in China and worldwide 24 countries confirmed 383 cases being diagnosed, 1 case death in February 10th, 2020.
32078069,At present, the mortality of 2019-nCoV in China is 2.3%, compared with 9.6% of SARS and 34.4% of MERS reported by WHO.
32078069,It seems the new virus is not as fatal as many people thought.
32078069,Chinese authorities improved surveillance network, made the laboratory be able to recognize the outbreak within a few weeks and announced the virus genome that provide efficient epidemiological control.
32078069,More comprehensive information is required to understand 2019-nCoV feature, the epidemiology of origin and spreading, and the clinical phenomina.
32078069,According to the current status, blocking transmission, isolation, protection, and alternative medication are the urgent management strategies against 2019-nCoV.
32079150,The geographic spread of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infections from the epicenter of Wuhan, China, has provided an opportunity to study the natural history of the recently emerged virus.
32079150,Using publicly available event-date data from the ongoing epidemic, the present study investigated the incubation period and other time intervals that govern the epidemiological dynamics of COVID-19 infections.
32079150,Our results show that the incubation period falls within the range of 2-14 days with 95% confidence and has a mean of around 5 days when approximated using the best-fit lognormal distribution.
32079150,The mean time from illness onset to hospital admission (for treatment and/or isolation) was estimated at 3-4 days without truncation and at 5-9 days when right truncated.
32079150,Based on the 95th percentile estimate of the incubation period, we recommend that the length of quarantine should be at least 14 days.
32079150,The median time delay of 13 days from illness onset to death (17 days with right truncation) should be considered when estimating the COVID-19 case fatality risk.
32080994,Complying with overall requirements of the government and regulations on public health emergences, as well as the clinical features of diagnosis and treatment of dental illness, this paper refers to previous guidelines and studies on the infection prevention and control in dental diagnosis and treatment in China and foreign countries.
32080994,Nanjing Stomatological Hospital has implemented the emergency management practices for the prevention and control of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP), mainly focusing on the implementation of prevention and control training programs for medical staffs and the infection control projects on the hospital environment.
32080994,This study could provide reference for rapid response and emergency management for the prevention and control of NCP in the departments of stomatology.
32080994,本文根据国家有关新型冠状病毒感染防控要求和突发公共卫生事件应急条例，以及口腔专科的临床诊疗特点，参考国内外口腔诊疗中感染防控相关指南和文献，结合医院疫情期口腔诊疗中感染防控的应急管理工作举措，提出应对此次新型冠状病毒肺炎疫情期医院感染防控的建议，重点聚焦疫情期医务人员防护培训及医院感染防控落实等方面，旨在为口腔专科在疫情发生期快速应对新型冠状病毒感染防控的应急管理提供参考。.
32084675,In December 2019, a new outbreak of coronavirus pneumonia began to occur.
32084675,Its pathogen is 2019-nCoV, which has the characteristics of strong infectivity and general susceptibility.
32084675,The current situation of prevention and control of new coronavirus pneumonia is severe.
32084675,In this context, as front-line medical workers bearing important responsibilities and pressure, while through strict management strategy, we can minimize the risk of infection exposure.
32084675,By summarizing the research progress and guidelines in recent years in the fields of colorectal cancer disease screening, treatment strategies(including early colorectal cancer, locally advanced colorectal cancer, obstructive colorectal cancer, metastatic colorectal cancer and the treatment of patients after neoadjuvant therapy), the choice of medication and time limit for adjuvant therapy, the protective measures for patients undergoing emergency surgery, the re-examination of postoperative patients and the protection of medical staff, etc., authors improve treatment strategies in order to provide more choices for patients to obtain the best treatment under the severe epidemic situation of new coronavirus pneumonia.
32084675,Meanwhile we hope that it can also provide more timely treatment modeling schemes for colleagues.
32084675,2019年12月，新型冠状病毒肺炎开始暴发流行，其病原体为2019-nCoV，具有感染力强，人群普遍易感的特点。
32084675,目前新型冠状病毒肺炎的防控形势严峻。
32084675,在这样的背景下，作为一线的医务工作者肩负着重要的责任和压力，但是通过我们严格的管理策略，可以尽可能地减少感染暴露的风险。
32084675,笔者通过对近几年的研究进展和指南的归纳总结，从结直肠癌的疾病筛查、治疗策略（包括早期结直肠癌、局部晚期结直肠癌、梗阻性结直肠癌、转移性结直肠癌以及新辅助治疗后患者的治疗）、辅助治疗的药物选择和时限选择、急诊手术患者的防护措施、术后患者复查以及医务人员的防护等方面，进行了治疗策略的改进，以期在新型冠状病毒肺炎疫情严峻的形势下，为广大患者提供更多的选择，以获得最佳的治疗，也为各位同道提供更合时宜的治疗模式。.
32084676,Novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) is currently raging in China.
32084676,It has been proven that NCP can be transmitted from human to human and cause hospital infection, which seriously threatens surgical staffs and inpatients.
32084676,Although colorectal surgery is not a front-line subject in the fight against the epidemic, but in this special situation, now it is a difficult task that with the premise of how to maximize the protection for patients and their families, health of medical staff, and the safety of wards and hospitals, we can provide the highest quality medical services to ensure the orderly development of previous clinical work.
32084676,Referring to the &quot;Diagnosis and Treatment Scheme for NCP (Trial Version 4 and 5)&quot; and combining the actual practice situation in our hospital with the &quot;Summary of New Coronavirus Files of Shanghai Renji Hospital&quot;, we summarize how to carry out the clinical practice of colorectal surgery under the situation of the prevention and control of the NCP epidemiology, meanwhile under such situation aiming the procedure of diagnose and treatment for emergency patients with colorectal tumor, we share the experiences of the diagnosis of colorectal tumor, the management of patients with colorectal cancer who are scheduled to be admitted for surgery, the protection of wards, the perioperative management.
32084676,More importantly, we introduce in detail the operative management and perioperative management of colorectal surgery patients suspected or diagnosed with new coronary pneumonia, including prevention and control measures for medical staff, operating rooms and surgical instruments.
32084676,The main points are as follows: (1) Multidisciplinary team (MDT) must be run through the diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer.
32084676,The members include not only routine departments, but also respiratory department and infectious department.
32084676,(2) Colonoscopy examination may cause cross infection of NCP to patients and doctors.
32084676,Therefore, it is prior to examine the emergency cases and life-threatening patients (bleeding, obstruction, gastrointestinal foreign bodies, etc.).
32084676,If the emergent patients (intestinal obstruction) with suspected or confirmed NCP, the surgeons must perform emergency surgery, and intestinal decompressive tube through colonoscopy is not recommended.
32084676,(3) The colorectal cancer patients with suspected or confirmed NCP should be placed in the isolated room with separate medical devices, and the operative room with negative pressure (under-5 Pa) must be separated.
32084676,All disposable medical items, body fluids and feces of the patients in perioperative periods must be unified disposed according to the medical waste standard.
32084676,(4) The surgical medical workers who process colorectal cancer patients with NCP must be protected by three-level.
32084676,After operation, the medical workers must receive medical observation and be isolated for 14 days.
32084676,We hope our &quot;Renji experience&quot; will be beneficial to colleagues.
32084676,新型冠状病毒肺炎（新冠肺炎）目前正在我国肆虐。
32084676,已经证实，新冠肺炎存在明显的院内感染现象，给外科医护人员和住院患者造成严重威胁。
32084676,虽然结直肠外科并不是此次抗击疫情的一线学科，但在特殊的形式下，如何最大限度地在保护患者、家属、医务工作者自身的健康以及病区和医院医疗安全的前提下，为患者提供最优质的医疗服务，保证以往临床工作的有序开展，是当下的艰巨任务。
32084676,笔者参照《新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎诊疗方案(试行第四版)》和《新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎诊疗方案(试行第五版)》，结合本院《上海仁济医院新型冠状病毒文件汇总》的实际工作情况，总结了新冠肺炎疫情防控形势下，如何开展结直肠外科临床工作，分享了如何在疫情防控情况下，针对结直肠肿瘤急诊患者的诊疗流程、对结直肠肿瘤的诊断和准备择期入院手术结直肠癌患者的处理、病房的防护、围手术期的管理等，更重要的是详细介绍了疑似或确诊新冠肺炎的结直肠外科患者手术及围手术期的管理，包括医务人员及手术室、手术器械的防控措施。
32084676,其中特别强调的包括：（1）多学科诊疗模式(MDT)应贯穿于结直肠肿瘤整个诊疗过程，MDT成员中，除常规相科室外，呼吸科和感染科也需列入。（
32084676,2）肠镜检查有可能导致患者交叉感染，对操作人员和护理人员也存在较大风险，故仅优先对于可能危及生命的急诊患者（出血、梗阻、消化道异物等）进行；若疑似新冠肺炎患者，不采取内镜下减压措施，直接拟定急诊手术治疗方案。（
32084676,3）疑似或确诊新冠肺炎的结直肠外科患者应放置于隔离病室，配备单独医疗器具，在指定的独立负压（-5 Pa以下）手术间完成手术；围手术期伤口换药等使用过所有一次性物品、体液、粪便等，均按医疗废物规范进行处置。（
32084676,4）参加疑似或确诊新冠肺炎的结直肠外科患者手术的医护人员应实施三级防护，术后应隔离进行&quot;医学观察&quot;14 d。
32084676,希望能对同道有所助益。.
32086886,Public health emergencies have an impact on the public mental health.
32086886,The outbreak of the novel coronavirus has affected the normal diagnosis and treatment services in oral medical institutions across the country.
32086886,Delay of non-emergency dental service will have a potential impact on the experience, cognition, treatment and rehabilitation of patients with oral diseases.
32086886,Through literature review, this paper reviewed the oral psychosomatic diseases closely related to patients' psychological state, such as oral mucosal disease, temporomandibular joint disease, bruxism, periodontal disease and so on.
32086886,It was believed that these patients might be more susceptible to the impact of stress events, and dental specialists should pay more attention to them.
32086886,At the same time, this paper analyzes the possible psychological stress symptoms of patients with different oral diseases, and puts forward suggestions for remote consultation and emergency treatment of dentists.
32086886,From the perspective of social role, dentists not only played the role of expert in dental home professional guidance, but also played the role of psychological counseling for patients.
32086886,突发公共卫生事件可对公众心理产生影响。
32086886,新型冠状病毒疫情爆发影响了全国口腔医疗机构正常开展诊疗服务，口腔门诊延期等应对措施可对口腔疾病患者的体验、认知、治疗和康复等方面产生潜在影响。
32086886,本文通过文献复习，对口腔黏膜病、颞下颌关节病、磨牙症、牙周病等与患者心理状态密切相关的口腔心身疾病进行回顾，认为这些患者可能更容易受到应激事件的影响，需要口腔专科医师提高关注度。
32086886,同时分析了不同口腔疾病患者可能出现的心理应激症状，为口腔医师远程咨询和急诊接诊提出建议。
32086886,疫情期间口腔医师不仅承担了口腔专业指导的专家角色，还承担了帮助患者进行心理疏导的角色。.
32086938,To provide an overview of the three major deadly coronaviruses and identify areas for improvement of future preparedness plans, as well as provide a critical assessment of the risk factors and actionable items for stopping their spread, utilizing lessons learned from the first two deadly coronavirus outbreaks, as well as initial reports from the current novel coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic in Wuhan, China.
32086938,Utilizing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, USA) website, and a comprehensive review of PubMed literature, we obtained information regarding clinical signs and symptoms, treatment and diagnosis, transmission methods, protection methods and risk factors for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and COVID-19.
32086938,Comparisons between the viruses were made.
32086938,Inadequate risk assessment regarding the urgency of the situation, and limited reporting on the virus within China has, in part, led to the rapid spread of COVID-19 throughout mainland China and into proximal and distant countries.
32086938,Compared with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has spread more rapidly, due in part to increased globalization and the focus of the epidemic.
32086938,Wuhan, China is a large hub connecting the North, South, East and West of China via railways and a major international airport.
32086938,The availability of connecting flights, the timing of the outbreak during the Chinese (Lunar) New Year, and the massive rail transit hub located in Wuhan has enabled the virus to perforate throughout China, and eventually, globally.
32086938,We conclude that we did not learn from the two prior epidemics of coronavirus and were ill-prepared to deal with the challenges the COVID-19 epidemic has posed.
32086938,Future research should attempt to address the uses and implications of internet of things (IoT) technologies for mapping the spread of infection.
32087334,At the end of December 2019, a novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, caused an outbreak of pneumonia spreading from Wuhan, Hubei province, to the whole country of China, which has posed great threats to public health and attracted enormous attention around the world.
32087334,To date, there are no clinically approved vaccines or antiviral drugs available for these human coronavirus infections.
32087334,Intensive research on the novel emerging human infectious coronaviruses is urgently needed to elucidate their route of transmission and pathogenic mechanisms, and to identify potential drug targets, which would promote the development of effective preventive and therapeutic countermeasures.
32087334,Herein, we describe the epidemic and etiological characteristics of 2019-nCoV, discuss its essential biological features, including tropism and receptor usage, summarize approaches for disease prevention and treatment, and speculate on the transmission route of 2019-nCoV.
32087621,The novel coronavirus pneumonia (new coronavirus pneumonia) (NCP) has been prevalent in Wuhan and spread rapidly to all of our country.
32087621,Some cases can develop into ARDS, or even death.
32087621,We will share the treatment experience of severe NCP with the first-line treatment experience.
32087621,The best respiratory support mode should be selected, but the timing of intubation and protection during intubation are two difficulties; patients with high level peep and poor effect in prone position can be given ECMO support.
32087621,For NCP patients with mechanical ventilation, reasonable sedation and analgesia strategies should be formulated; delirium should not be ignored.
32087621,In addition, there is up regulation of inflammatory factors in patients with severe NCP, but the effect of renal replacement therapy needs to be further confirmed by clinical research.
32087621,新型冠状病毒肺炎（novel coronavirus pneumonia，NCP）在武汉感染流行并迅速蔓延至全国，部分病例可发生急性呼吸窘迫综合征（acute respiratory distress syndrome，ARDS），甚至引起死亡。
32087621,在此我们结合一线的救治体会，给大家分享危重型NCP的治疗经验。
32087621,需选择最佳呼吸支持方式，但气管插管时机的把握及插管时的防护是两个难点；高水平呼气末正压通气（PEEP）、俯卧位效果不佳的患者可行体外膜氧合（ECMO）支持。
32087621,对于机械通气的NCP患者，制定合理的镇静镇痛策略，谵妄不容忽视。
32087621,此外，危重型NCP患者体内存在炎性因子的上调，但肾脏替代治疗的效果还需临床研究进一步证实。.
32088333,Only a month after the outbreak of pneumonia caused by 2019-nCoV, more than forty-thousand people were infected.
32088333,This put enormous pressure on the Chinese government, medical healthcare provider, and the general public, but also made the international community deeply nervous.
32088333,On the 25th day after the outbreak, the Chinese government implemented strict traffic restrictions on the area where the 2019-nCoV had originated-Hubei province, whose capital city is Wuhan.
32088333,Ten days later, the rate of increase of cases in Hubei showed a significant difference (p = 0.0001) compared with the total rate of increase in other provinces of China.
32088333,These preliminary data suggest the effectiveness of a traffic restriction policy for this pandemic thus far.
32088333,At the same time, solid financial support and improved research ability, along with network communication technology, also greatly facilitated the application of epidemic prevention measures.
32088333,These measures were motivated by the need to provide effective treatment of patients, and involved consultation with three major groups in policy formulation-public health experts, the government, and the general public.
32088333,It was also aided by media and information technology, as well as international cooperation.
32088333,This experience will provide China and other countries with valuable lessons for quickly coordinating and coping with future public health emergencies.
32092748,Rapidly sharing scientific information is an effective way to reduce public panic about COVID-19, and doing so is the key to providing real-time guidance to epidemiologists working to contain the outbreak, clinicians managing patients, and modelers helping to understand future developments and the possible effectiveness of various interventions.
32092748,This issue has rapidly reviewed and published articles describing COVID-19, including the drug treatment options for SARS-CoV-2, its clinical characteristics, and therapies involving a combination of Chinese and Western medicine, the efficacy of chloroquine phosphate in the treatment of COVID-19 associated pneumonia according to clinical studies, and reflections on the system of reserve medical supplies for public health emergencies.
32092748,As an academic journal, we will continue to quickly and transparently share data with frontline healthcare workers who need to know the epidemiological and clinical features of COVID-19.
32093211,In December 2019, cases of unidentified pneumonia with a history of exposure in the Huanan Seafood Market were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province.
32093211,A novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was identified to be accountable for this disease.
32093211,Human-to-human transmission is confirmed, and this disease (named COVID-19 by World Health Organization (WHO)) spread rapidly around the country and the world.
32093211,As of 18 February 2020, the number of confirmed cases had reached 75,199 with 2009 fatalities.
32093211,The COVID-19 resulted in a much lower case-fatality rate (about 2.67%) among the confirmed cases, compared with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).
32093211,Among the symptom composition of the 45 fatality cases collected from the released official reports, the top four are fever, cough, short of breath, and chest tightness/pain.
32093211,The major comorbidities of the fatality cases include hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, cerebral infarction, and chronic bronchitis.
32093211,The source of the virus and the pathogenesis of this disease are still unconfirmed.
32093211,No specific therapeutic drug has been found.
32093211,The Chinese Government has initiated a level-1 public health response to prevent the spread of the disease.
32093211,Meanwhile, it is also crucial to speed up the development of vaccines and drugs for treatment, which will enable us to defeat COVID-19 as soon as possible.
32096366,To analyze the dynamic changes of chest CT images of patients with corona virus disease-19 (COVID-19).
32096366,Fifty-two cases of COVID-19 were admitted in the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine.
32096366,The consecutive chest CT scans were followed up for all patients with an average of 4 scans performed per patient during the hospitalization.
32096366,The shortest interval between each scan was 2 days and the longest was 7 days.
32096366,The shape, number and distribution of lung shadows, as well as the characteristics of the lesions on the CT images were reviewed.
32096366,The obvious shadows infiltrating the lungs were shown on CT images in 50 cases, for other 2 cases there was no abnormal changes in the lungs during the first CT examination.
32096366,Ground-glass opacities (GGO) were found in 48 cases (92.3%), and 19 cases (36.5%) had patchy consolidation and sub-consolidation, which were accompanied with air bronchi sign in 17 cases (32.7%).
32096366,Forty one cases (78.8%) showed a thickened leaflet interval, 4 cases (7.6%) had a small number of fibrous stripes.
32096366,During hospitalization, GGO lesions in COVID-19 patients gradually became rare, the fibrous strip shadows increased and it became the most common imaging manifestation.
32096366,The lesions rapidly progressed in 39 cases (75.0%) within 6-9 days after admission.
32096366,On days 10-14 of admission, the lesions distinctly resolved in 40 cases (76.9%).
32096366,The chest CT images of patients with COVID-19 have certain characteristics with dynamic changes, which are of value for monitoring disease progress and clinical treatment.
32096367,The current epidemic situation of corona virus disease-19 (COVID-19) still remained severe.
32096367,As the National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine is the primary medical care center for COVID-19 inZhejiang Province.
32096367,Based on the present expert consensus carried out by National Health Commission and National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, our team summarized and established an effective treatment strategy centered on &quot;Four-Anti and Two-Balance&quot; for clinical practice.
32096367,The &quot;Four-Anti and Two-Balance&quot;strategy included antivirus, anti-shock, anti-hyoxemia, anti-secondary infection, and maintaining of water, electrolyte and acid base balance and microecological balance.
32096367,Meanwhile, integrated multidisciplinarypersonalized treatment was recommended to improve therapeutic effect.
32096367,The importance of early viralogical detection, dynamic monitoring of inflammatory indexes and chest radiograph was emphasized in clinical decision-making.
32096367,Sputum was observed with the highest positive rate of RT-PCR results.
32096367,Viral nucleic acids could be detected in10% patients'blood samples at acute periodand 50% of patients had positive RT-PCR results in their feces.
32096367,We also isolated alive viral strains from feces, indicating potential infectiousness of feces.Dynamic cytokine detection was necessary to timely identifyingcytokine storms and application of artificial liver blood purification system.
32096367,The &quot;Four-Anti and Two-Balance&quot;strategyeffectively increased cure rate and reduced mortality.
32096367,Early antiviral treatment could alleviate disease severity and prevent illness progression, and we found lopinavir/ritonavir combined with abidol showed antiviraleffects in COVID-19.
32096367,Shock and hypoxemia were usually caused by cytokine storms.
32096367,The artificial liver blood purification system could rapidly remove inflammatory mediators and block cytokine storm.Moreover, it also favoredthe balance of fluid, electrolyte and acid-base and thus improved treatment efficacy in critical illness.
32096367,For cases of severe illness, early and also short periods of moderate glucocorticoid was supported.
32096367,Patients with oxygenation index below 200 mmHg should be transferred to intensive medical center.
32096367,Conservative oxygen therapy was preferred and noninvasive ventilation was not recommended.
32096367,Patients with mechanical ventilation should be strictly supervised with cluster ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention strategies.
32096367,Antimicrobial prophylaxis should be prescribed rationally and was not recommended except for patients with long course of disease, repeated fever and elevated procalcitonin (PCT), meanwhile secondary fungal infection should be concerned.Some patients with COVID-19 showed intestinal microbialdysbiosis with decreasedprobiotics such as <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Bifidobacterium</i>.
32096367,Nutritional and gastrointestinal function should be assessed for all patients.Nutritional support and application of prebiotics or probiotics were suggested to regulate the balance of intestinal microbiota and reduce the risk of secondary infection due to bacterial translocation.
32096367,Anxiety and fear were common in patients with COVID-19.
32096367,Therefore, we established dynamic assessment and warning for psychological crisis.
32096367,We also integrated Chinese medicine in treatment to promote disease rehabilitation through classification methods of traditional Chinese medicine.
32096367,We optimized nursing process for severe patients to promote their rehabilitation.
32096367,It remained unclear about viral clearance pattern after the SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32096367,Therefore, two weeks' quarantine for discharged patients was required and a regular following up was also needed.The Zhejiang experience above and suggestions have been implemented in our center and achieved good results.
32096367,However, since COVID-19 was a newly emerging disease, more work was warranted to improve strategies of prevention, diagnosis and treatment for COVID-19.
32096395,Currently, the epidemic of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is still ongoing.
32096395,The characteristics including high contagiousness, herd susceptibility and clinical phenotype diversity, made a serious influence on people's daily life and rountine therapy for other diseases.
32096395,Breast dieases are clinical common diseases.
32096395,In the central epidemic area of COVID-19, Hubei province, especially Wuhan, the clinical specialists of breast diseases should consider all of the following factors comprehensively: the prevention of COVID-19, the diagnosis and treatment of breast diseases and the accessibility of medical resources.
32096395,Besides, we should select the appropriate therapy and optimize treatment process so as to prevent the propagation and cross infection of COVID-19 as well as manage the breast diseases without delay.
32096395,Therefore, we carried out some management proposals of the patients with breast diseases in the central epidemic area during the epidemic of COVID-19 on the basis of conventional treatment guidelines and clinical experiences.
32096395,The suggestions and corrections from colleagues will be welcomed.
32096395,新型冠状病毒肺炎爆发以来，由于其传染力强，人群易感性高，临床表现多样化，严重影响了群众正常的工作和生活，也影响了其他疾病的正常诊疗。
32096395,乳腺疾病是临床常见病、多发病。
32096395,在湖北省，特别是武汉等疫情严重地区，乳腺专科医师需要全面考虑疫情防控、疾病诊疗和医疗资源可及性等因素，合理选择诊疗方案，优化诊治流程；既避免新型冠状病毒肺炎的传播和交叉感染，也不延误疾病诊治。
32096395,为此，我们依据相关诊疗规范和指南，结合实际工作经验，就疫情严重地区乳腺疾病诊疗问题提出有关策略建议。.
32096396,The outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia occurred in Wuhan, Hubei province of China, at the end of 2019, and spread rapidly across the country.
32096396,After the outbreak of this disease, the overwhelming majority of cities have launched the &quot;first level response&quot; and the regular diagnosis and treatment of cancer patients are greatly affected.
32096396,The digestive systemic cancer is the most common malignancy.
32096396,Most patients are diagnosed in the advanced stage with poor prognosis.
32096396,The epidemic of novel coronavirus pneumonia poses new challenges to diagnosis and treatment of the patients with digestive system malignancies.
32096396,Based on the fully understanding of the characteristics of digestive system tumors, we should change the treatment strategy and adopt more reasonable treatment strategy timely during the epidemic period to minimize the adverse effects of the epidemic of novel coronavirus pneumonia on the treatment.
32096396,2019年12月，新型冠状病毒肺炎疫情在湖北武汉发生，并迅速向全国蔓延。

32096396,疫情期间，消化系统恶性肿瘤患者的诊治面临着巨大考验。
32096396,在充分认识消化系统恶性肿瘤特点的基础上，疫情期间适时地转变治疗策略，采用更加合理的治疗方式，以最大程度降低疫情对消化系统恶性肿瘤患者的治疗造成的不良影响。.
32098302,Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is an emerging pathogen that was first identified in Wuhan, China in late December 2019.
32098302,This virus is responsible for the ongoing outbreak that causes severe respiratory illness and pneumonia-like infection in humans.
32098302,Due to the increasing number of cases in China and outside China, the WHO declared coronavirus as a global health emergency.
32098302,Nearly 35,000 cases were reported and at least 24 other countries or territories have reported coronavirus cases as early on as February.
32098302,Inter-human transmission was reported in a few countries, including the United States.
32098302,Neither an effective anti-viral nor a vaccine is currently available to treat this infection.
32098302,As the virus is a newly emerging pathogen, many questions remain unanswered regarding the virus's reservoirs, pathogenesis, transmissibility, and much more is unknown.
32098302,The collaborative efforts of researchers are needed to fill the knowledge gaps about this new virus, to develop the proper diagnostic tools, and effective treatment to combat this infection.
32098302,Recent advancements in plant biotechnology proved that plants have the ability to produce vaccines or biopharmaceuticals rapidly in a short time.
32098302,In this review, the outbreak of 2019-nCoV in China, the need for rapid vaccine development, and the potential of a plant system for biopharmaceutical development are discussed.
32098422,After the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in the world in 2003, human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been reported as pathogens that cause severe symptoms in respiratory tract infections.
32098422,Recently, a new emerged HCoV isolated from the respiratory epithelium of unexplained pneumonia patients in the Wuhan seafood market caused a major disease outbreak and has been named the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32098422,This virus causes acute lung symptoms, leading to a condition that has been named as &quot;coronavirus disease 2019&quot; (COVID-19).
32098422,The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and of SARS-CoV caused widespread fear and concern and has threatened global health security.
32098422,There are some similarities and differences in the epidemiology and clinical features between these two viruses and diseases that are caused by these viruses.
32098422,The goal of this work is to systematically review and compare between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in the context of their virus incubation, originations, diagnosis and treatment methods, genomic and proteomic sequences, and pathogenic mechanisms.
32098466,Thousands of medical workers in the Military support Hubei medical team are exerting themselves in many hospitals in Hubei Province.
32098466,They are diligent in treating patients, at the same time, they constantly summarize experience and combine the characteristics of military hospitals.
32098466,According to &quot; the Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia &quot;(6th edition) of the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, a new guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of 2019 novel coronavirus infection suitable for the military (first trial version) was established.

32100486,From December 2019, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia (formerly known as the 2019 novel Coronavirus [2019-nCoV]) broke out in Wuhan, China.
32100486,In this study, we present serial CT findings in a 40-year-old female patient with COVID-19 pneumonia who presented with the symptoms of fever, chest tightness, and fatigue.
32100486,She was diagnosed with COVID-19 infection confirmed by real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction.
32100486,CT showed rapidly progressing peripheral consolidations and ground-glass opacities in both lungs.
32100486,After treatment, the lesions were shown to be almost absorbed leaving the fibrous lesions.
32100979,The outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is spreading rapidly.
32100979,In order to prevent cluster outbreaks, the government strengthened the management and control of personnel mobility, which had a great impact on the examination and treatment of breast cancer patients.

32102777,An ongoing outbreak of a novel coronavirus infection in Wuhan, China since December 2019 has led to 31,516 infected persons and 638 deaths across 25 countries (till 16:00 on February 7, 2020).
32102777,The virus causing this pneumonia was then named as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by the World Health Organization.
32102777,To promote the data sharing and make all relevant information of 2019-nCoV publicly available, we construct the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Resource (2019nCoVR, https://bigd.big.ac.cn/ncov). 2019nCoVR features comprehensive integration of genomic and proteomic sequences as well as their metadata information from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data, National Center for Biotechnology Information, China National GeneBank, National Microbiology Data Center and China National Center for Bioinformation (CNCB)/National Genomics Data Center (NGDC).
32102777,It also incorporates a wide range of relevant information including scientific literatures, news, and popular articles for science dissemination, and provides visualization functionalities for genome variation analysis results based on all collected 2019-nCoV strains.
32102777,Moreover, by linking seamlessly with related databases in CNCB/NGDC, 2019nCoVR offers virus data submission and sharing services for raw sequence reads and assembled sequences.
32102777,In this report, we provide comprehensive descriptions on data deposition, management, release and utility in 2019nCoVR, laying important foundations in aid of studies on virus classification and origin, genome variation and evolution, fast detection, drug development and pneumonia precision prevention and therapy.
32102777,2019年12月在中国武汉开始爆发的新型肺炎已造成全球25个国家/地区的31516人感染、638人死亡(截止2020年2月7日16时),引起该肺炎的病毒被世界卫生组织命名为2019新型冠状病毒(2019-nCoV)。
32102777,为促进2019-nCoV数据共享应用并及时向全球公众提供病毒的相关信息,国家生物信息中心(CNCB)/国家基因组科学数据中心(NGDC)建立了2019新型冠状病毒信息库(2019nCoVR,https://bigd.big.ac.cn/ncov)。
32102777,该信息库整合了来自德国全球流感病毒数据库、美国国家生物技术信息中心、深圳(国家)基因库、国家微生物科学数据中心及CNCB/NGDC等机构公开发布的2019-nCoV核苷酸和蛋白质序列数据、元信息、学术文献、新闻动态、科普文章等信息,开展了不同冠状病毒株的基因组序列变异分析并提供可视化展示。
32102777,同时,2019nCoVR无缝对接CNCB/NGDC的相关数据库,提供新测序病毒株系的基因组原始测序数据、组装后序列的在线汇交、管理与共享、国际数据库同步发布等数据服务。
32102777,本文对2019nCoVR数据汇交、管理、发布及使用等进行全面阐述,以方便用户了解该信息库各项功能及数据状况,为加速开展病毒的分类溯源、变异演化、快速检测、药物研发以及新型肺炎的精准预防与治疗等研究提供重要基础。.
32104915,Following the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), another highly pathogenic coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 (previously known as 2019-nCoV) emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and rapidly spreads around the world.
32104915,This virus shares highly homological sequence with SARS-CoV, and causes acute, highly lethal pneumonia coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with clinical symptoms similar to those reported for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
32104915,The most characteristic symptom of patients with COVID-19 is respiratory distress, and most of the patients admitted to the intensive care could not breathe spontaneously.
32104915,Additionally, some patients with COVID-19 also showed neurologic signs, such as headache, nausea, and vomiting.
32104915,Increasing evidence shows that coronaviruses are not always confined to the respiratory tract and that they may also invade the central nervous system inducing neurological diseases.
32104915,The infection of SARS-CoV has been reported in the brains from both patients and experimental animals, where the brainstem was heavily infected.
32104915,Furthermore, some coronaviruses have been demonstrated able to spread via a synapse-connected route to the medullary cardiorespiratory center from the mechanoreceptors and chemoreceptors in the lung and lower respiratory airways.
32104915,Considering the high similarity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2, it remains to make clear whether the potential invasion of SARS-CoV2 is partially responsible for the acute respiratory failure of patients with COVID-19.
32104915,Awareness of this may have a guiding significance for the prevention and treatment of the SARS-CoV-2-induced respiratory failure.
32104917,The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) quickly spread all over China and to more than 20 other countries.
32104917,Although the virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [SARS-Cov-2]) nucleic acid real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test has become the standard method for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, these real-time PCR test kits have many limitations.
32104917,In addition, high false-negative rates were reported.
32104917,There is an urgent need for an accurate and rapid test method to quickly identify a large number of infected patients and asymptomatic carriers to prevent virus transmission and assure timely treatment of patients.
32104917,We have developed a rapid and simple point-of-care lateral flow immunoassay that can detect immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG antibodies simultaneously against SARS-CoV-2 virus in human blood within 15 minutes which can detect patients at different infection stages.
32104917,With this test kit, we carried out clinical studies to validate its clinical efficacy uses.
32104917,The clinical detection sensitivity and specificity of this test were measured using blood samples collected from 397 PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients and 128 negative patients at eight different clinical sites.
32104917,The overall testing sensitivity was 88.66% and specificity was 90.63%.
32104917,In addition, we evaluated clinical diagnosis results obtained from different types of venous and fingerstick blood samples.
32104917,The results indicated great detection consistency among samples from fingerstick blood, serum and plasma of venous blood.
32104917,The IgM-IgG combined assay has better utility and sensitivity compared with a single IgM or IgG test.
32104917,It can be used for the rapid screening of SARS-CoV-2 carriers, symptomatic or asymptomatic, in hospitals, clinics, and test laboratories.
32105052,Since December 2019, unexplained pneumonia has appeared in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, and a new type of coronavirus infection was confirmed as COVID-19.
32105052,COVID-19 spread rapidly nationwide and abroad.
32105052,The COVID-19 has brought huge impacts to all the people and walks of life, especially to the medical and health systems.
32105052,It has also brought great challenges to the treatment of patients with cancer.
32105052,Esophageal cancer is a common malignant tumor in China and most of the patients are in the middle and advanced stage when diagnosed, with immunosuppressive and poor prognosis.
32105052,The selection of surgical procedures and perioperative managements of esophageal cancer require all thoracic surgeons work together to figure out a reasonable system of surgical treatment and emergency response.
32105052,自2019年12月以来，湖北省武汉市出现不明原因肺炎，后确诊为2019新型冠状病毒感染，疫情迅速向全国其他地区及境外传播。
32105052,新型冠状病毒肺炎疫情给各行各业都带来巨大影响，尤其对于医疗卫生事业影响巨大，也对肿瘤患者的诊治提出巨大挑战。
32105052,食管癌是我国常见的恶性肿瘤，大多数患者确诊时已处于中晚期，患者免疫力低，预后差。
32105052,对于胸外科医师而言，适时选择外科手术，以及如何应对疫情下食管癌患者的围手术期处理，需要全体胸外科医师共同努力，制定科学的胸外科诊治流程和应急对策。.
32105632,An ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.
32105632,Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce.
32105632,We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.
32105632,In this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020.
32105632,Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected.
32105632,Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors.
32105632,The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020.
32105632,Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.
32105632,Of 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included.
32105632,The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever. 32 (61·5%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3-11) days for non-survivors.
32105632,Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively.
32105632,Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax. 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation.
32105632,Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients.
32105632,The mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable.
32105632,The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1-2 weeks after ICU admission.
32105632,Older patients (&gt;65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.
32105632,The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.
32105632,None.
32105680,Coronavirus disease 2019 is an emerging disease with a rapid increase in cases and deaths since its first identification in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.
32105680,Limited data are available about coronavirus disease 2019 during pregnancy; however, information on illnesses associated with other highly pathogenic coronaviruses (ie, severe acute respiratory syndrome and the Middle East respiratory syndrome) might provide insights into coronavirus disease 2019's effects during pregnancy.
32105680,Coronaviruses cause illness ranging in severity from the common cold to severe respiratory illness and death.
32105680,Currently the primary epidemiologic risk factors for coronavirus disease 2019 include travel from mainland China (especially Hubei Province) or close contact with infected individuals within 14 days of symptom onset.
32105680,Data suggest an incubation period of ∼5 days (range, 2-14 days).
32105680,Average age of hospitalized patients has been 49-56 years, with a third to half with an underlying illness.
32105680,Children have been rarely reported.
32105680,Men were more frequent among hospitalized cases (54-73%).
32105680,Frequent manifestations include fever, cough, myalgia, headache, and diarrhea.
32105680,Abnormal testing includes abnormalities on chest radiographic imaging, lymphopenia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia.
32105680,Initial reports suggest that acute respiratory distress syndrome develops in 17-29% of hospitalized patients.
32105680,Overall case fatality rate appears to be ∼1%; however, early data may overestimate this rate.
32105680,In 2 reports describing 18 pregnancies with coronavirus disease 2019, all were infected in the third trimester, and clinical findings were similar to those in nonpregnant adults.
32105680,Fetal distress and preterm delivery were seen in some cases.
32105680,All but 2 pregnancies were cesarean deliveries and no evidence of in utero transmission was seen.
32105680,Data on severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome in pregnancy are sparse.
32105680,For severe acute respiratory syndrome, the largest series of 12 pregnancies had a case-fatality rate of 25%.
32105680,Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome in 4, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy in 3, renal failure in 3, secondary bacterial pneumonia in 2, and sepsis in 2 patients.
32105680,Mechanical ventilation was 3 times more likely among pregnant compared with nonpregnant women.
32105680,Among 7 first-trimester infections, 4 ended in spontaneous abortion.
32105680,Four of 5 women with severe acute respiratory syndrome after 24 weeks' gestation delivered preterm.
32105680,For Middle East respiratory syndrome, there were 13 case reports in pregnant women, of which 2 were asymptomatic, identified as part of a contact investigation; 3 patients (23%) died.
32105680,Two pregnancies ended in fetal demise and 2 were born preterm.
32105680,No evidence of in utero transmission was seen in severe acute respiratory syndrome or Middle East respiratory syndrome.
32105680,Currently no coronavirus-specific treatments have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.
32105680,Because coronavirus disease 2019 might increase the risk for pregnancy complications, management should optimally be in a health care facility with close maternal and fetal monitoring.
32105680,Principles of management of coronavirus disease 2019 in pregnancy include early isolation, aggressive infection control procedures, oxygen therapy, avoidance of fluid overload, consideration of empiric antibiotics (secondary to bacterial infection risk), laboratory testing for the virus and coinfection, fetal and uterine contraction monitoring, early mechanical ventilation for progressive respiratory failure, individualized delivery planning, and a team-based approach with multispecialty consultations.
32105680,Information on coronavirus disease 2019 is increasing rapidly.
32105680,Clinicians should continue to follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website to stay up to date with the latest information (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/hcp/index.html).
32106216,An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) began in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019, and has spread throughout China and to 31 other countries and territories, including the United States (1).
32106216,As of February 23, 2020, there were 76,936 reported cases in mainland China and 1,875 cases in locations outside mainland China (1).
32106216,There have been 2,462 associated deaths worldwide; no deaths have been reported in the United States.
32106216,Fourteen cases have been diagnosed in the United States, and an additional 39 cases have occurred among repatriated persons from high-risk settings, for a current total of 53 cases within the United States.
32106216,This report summarizes the aggressive measures (2,3) that CDC, state and local health departments, multiple other federal agencies, and other partners are implementing to slow and try to contain transmission of COVID-19 in the United States.
32106216,These measures require the identification of cases and contacts of persons with COVID-19 in the United States and the recommended assessment, monitoring, and care of travelers arriving from areas with substantial COVID-19 transmission.
32106216,Although these measures might not prevent widespread transmission of the virus in the United States, they are being implemented to 1) slow the spread of illness; 2) provide time to better prepare state and local health departments, health care systems, businesses, educational organizations, and the general public in the event that widespread transmission occurs; and 3) better characterize COVID-19 to guide public health recommendations and the development and deployment of medical countermeasures, including diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines.
32106216,U.S. public health authorities are monitoring the situation closely, and CDC is coordinating efforts with the World Health Organization (WHO) and other global partners.
32106216,Interim guidance is available at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/index.html.
32106216,As more is learned about this novel virus and this outbreak, CDC will rapidly incorporate new knowledge into guidance for action by CDC, state and local health departments, health care providers, and communities.

32108351,We aim to summarize reliable evidence of evidence-based medicine for the treatment and prevention of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by analyzing all the published studies on the clinical characteristics of patients with SARS-CoV-2.
32108351,PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and other databases were searched.
32108351,Several studies on the clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection were collected for meta-analysis.
32108351,Ten studies were included in Meta-analysis, including a total number of 50466 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32108351,Meta-analysis shows that, among these patients, the incidence of fever was 0.891 (95% CI: 0.818, 0.945), the incidence of cough was 0.722 (95% CI: 0.657, 0.782), and the incidence of muscle soreness or fatigue was 0.425 (95% CI: 0.213, 0.652).
32108351,The incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was 0.148 (95% CI: 0.046, 0.296), the incidence of abnormal chest computer tomography (CT) was 0.966 (95% CI: 0.921, 0.993), the percentage of severe cases in all infected cases was 0.181 (95% CI: 0.127, 0.243), and the case fatality rate of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection was 0.043 (95% CI: 0.027, 0.061).
32108351,Fever and cough are the most common symptoms in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and most of these patients have abnormal chest CT examination.
32108351,Several people have muscle soreness or fatigue as well as ARDS.
32108351,Diarrhea, hemoptysis, headache, sore throat, shock, and other symptoms are rare.
32108351,The case fatality rate of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is lower than that of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).
32108351,This meta-analysis also has limitations, so the conclusions of this Meta-analysis still need to be verified by more relevant studies with more careful design, more rigorous execution, and larger sample size.
32108352,So far, there is a lack of effective drugs for the new coronavirus pneumonia.
32108352,With more and more patients diagnosed, China has carried out more than 100 clinical studies of new coronavirus infection, including antiviral drugs, antimalarial drugs, glucocorticoids, plasma therapy, virus vaccine, and other Western drugs, while Chinese medicine research accounted for half of the studies.
32108352,Most of the trials were initiated by investigators and the study period would last for 1 to 11 months.
32108352,The primary endpoints included symptom improvement and virus nucleic acid turning negative, but the optimal endpoint has not been determined.
32108352,Although the final results of studies will take a long time to complete, the interim research data may provide some help for the current urgent demand for drug treatment.
32108352,Compared with that of during SARS period in 2003, China has the stronger capability to carry out clinical trials of new drugs in emergency period.
32108459,Prevention and control about the situation of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) are grim at present.
32108459,In addition to supporting the frontline actively, medical workers in general surgery spare no efforts in making good diagnosis and treatment of specialized diseases by optimizing treatment process, providing medical advice online, mastering indications of delayed operation and emergency operation reasonably, etc.
32108459,Budd-Chiari syndrome is a complex disorder, and severity of the disease varies, serious cases can be life threatening.
32108459,While fighting the epidemic, medical workers should also ensure the medical needs of patients.
32108459,However, instead of continuing the traditional treatment, a new management system should be developed.
32108459,Based on the characteristics of Budd-Chiari syndrome patients in China and our experience, we divide the patients into ordinary and critical cases, and treatment strategies suitable for the epidemic period of COVID-19 are put forward for reference and discussion by physicians.
32108459,目前新型冠状病毒肺炎疫情防控形势严峻，普通外科医务人员除积极支援一线外，也通过优化就诊流程、开通线上诊疗、合理把握延期手术及急诊手术指征等，做好专科疾病的诊治工作。
32108459,巴德-吉亚利综合征疾病复杂，患者病情轻重程度不一，严重者可危及生命。
32108459,医务人员在抗击疫情的同时，也应保障患者的医疗需求。
32108459,但疫情期间不能延续传统诊疗方案，需制定新的管理体系。
32108459,本文根据国内巴德-吉亚利综合征患者的病情特征，结合自身经验，将巴德-吉亚利综合征患者分为普通患者和急危重症患者，提出适用于新型冠状病毒肺炎疫情期间巴德-吉亚利综合征的治疗策略，供广大医师借鉴和探讨。.
32108460,From December 2019, the new coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) broke out in Wuhan, Hubei, and spread rapidly to the nationwide.
32108460,On January 20, 2020, the National Health Committee classified COVID-19 pneumonia as one of B class infectious diseases and treated it as class A infectious disease.
32108460,During the epidemic period, the routine diagnosis and treatment of tumor patients was affected with varying degrees.
32108460,In this special period, we performed the superiority of the multi-disciplinary team of diagnosis and treatment, achieved accurate diagnosis and treatment of patients with hepatobiliary malignant tumors, provided support for these patients with limited medical resources, and helped them to survive during the epidemic period.On the basis of fully understanding the new coronavirus pneumonia, the treatment strategy should be changed timely during the epidemic, and more appropriate treatment methods should be adopted to minimize the adverse effect of the epidemic on tumor treatment.
32108460,2019年12月底新型冠状病毒肺炎（COVID-19）在湖北武汉爆发，短时间内疫情蔓延至全国范围。
32108460,2020年1月20日，国家卫生健康委员会将COVID-19纳入乙类传染病并按照甲类传染病进行防治。
32108460,在抗击疫情期间，肿瘤患者的常规诊治流程受到了不同程度的影响。
32108460,在这一特殊时期，应充分发挥多学科诊疗团队的优势，做到肝胆系统恶性肿瘤患者的精准诊疗，利用有限的医疗资源为患者提供支持，帮助患者度过疫情。

32109443,To investigate the clinical and imaging characteristics of computed tomography (CT) in novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) caused by SARS-CoV-2.
32109443,A retrospective analysis was performed on the imaging findings of patients confirmed with COVID-19 pneumonia who had chest CT scanning and treatment after disease onset.
32109443,The clinical and imaging data were analyzed.
32109443,Fifty patients were enrolled, including mild type in nine, common in 28, severe in 10 and critically severe in the rest three.
32109443,Mild patients (29 years) were significantly (P&lt;0.03) younger than either common (44.5 years) or severe (54.7) and critically severe (65.7 years) patients, and common patients were also significantly (P&lt;0.03) younger than severe and critically severe patients.
32109443,Mild patients had low to moderate fever (&lt;39.1 °C), 49 (98%) patients had normal or slightly reduced leukocyte count, 14 (28%) had decreased counts of lymphocytes, and 26 (52%) patients had increased C-reactive protein.
32109443,Nine mild patients were negative in CT imaging.
32109443,For all the other types of NCP, the lesion was in the right upper lobe in 30 cases, right middle lobe in 22, right lower lobe in 39, left upper lobe in 33 and left lower lobe in 36.
32109443,The lesion was primarily located in the peripheral area under the pleura with possible extension towards the pulmonary hilum.
32109443,Symmetrical lesions were seen in 26 cases and asymmetrical in 15.
32109443,The density of lesion was mostly uneven with ground glass opacity as the primary presentation accompanied by partial consolidation and fibrosis.
32109443,CT imaging presentations of NCP are mostly patchy ground glass opacities in the peripheral areas under the pleura with partial consolidation which will be absorbed with formation of fibrotic stripes if improved.
32109443,CT scanning provides important bases for early diagnosis and treatment of NCP.
32110875,Rapid diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics are important interventions for the management of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak.
32110875,It is timely to systematically review the potential of these interventions, including those for Middle East respiratory syndrome-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, to guide policymakers globally on their prioritization of resources for research and development.
32110875,A systematic search was carried out in three major electronic databases (PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library) to identify published studies in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.
32110875,Supplementary strategies through Google Search and personal communications were used.
32110875,A total of 27 studies fulfilled the criteria for review.
32110875,Several laboratory protocols for confirmation of suspected 2019-nCoV cases using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) have been published.
32110875,A commercial RT-PCR kit developed by the Beijing Genomic Institute is currently widely used in China and likely in Asia.
32110875,However, serological assays as well as point-of-care testing kits have not been developed but are likely in the near future.
32110875,Several vaccine candidates are in the pipeline.
32110875,The likely earliest Phase 1 vaccine trial is a synthetic DNA-based candidate.
32110875,A number of novel compounds as well as therapeutics licensed for other conditions appear to have in vitro efficacy against the 2019-nCoV.
32110875,Some are being tested in clinical trials against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, while others have been listed for clinical trials against 2019-nCoV.
32110875,However, there are currently no effective specific antivirals or drug combinations supported by high-level evidence.
32111113,The treatment of critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) faces compelling challenges.
32111113,In this issue, we'd like to share our first-line treatment experience in treating COVID-19.
32111113,Hemodynamics need be closely monitored and different types of shock should be distinguished.
32111113,Vasoconstrictor drugs should be used rationally and alerting of complications is of the same importance.
32111113,The risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) needs to be assessed, and effective prevention should be carried out for high-risk patients.
32111113,It is necessary to consider the possibility of pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) in patients with sudden onset of oxygenation deterioration, respiratory distress, reduced blood pressure.
32111113,However, comprehensive analysis of disease state should be taken into the interpretation of abnormally elevated D-Dimer.
32111113,Nutritional support is the basis of treatment.
32111113,It's important to establish individual therapy regimens and to evaluate, monitor and adjust dynamically.
32111113,Under the current epidemic situation, convalescent plasma can only be used empirically, indications need to be strictly screened, the blood transfusion process should be closely monitored and the curative effect should be dynamically evaluated.
32111113,新型冠状病毒肺炎（coronavirus disease 2019，COVID-19）危重型患者的救治面临严峻挑战。
32111113,循环状态需严密监测并鉴别不同类型的休克，合理应用血管收缩药物，警惕并发症。
32111113,评估静脉血栓栓塞症（VTE）风险，高危者需实施有效预防，对突然出现氧合恶化、呼吸窘迫、血压下降等临床表现者需警惕肺血栓栓塞症（PTE）的发生，但对D-二聚体异常增高的解读需结合疾病的严重状态综合分析。
32111113,营养支持作为基础治疗手段，应制定个体化营养方案，评估并动态调整。
32111113,当前疫情下，恢复期血浆只能经验性应用，适应证需严格把控，输血过程中严密监测并动态评估疗效。.

32111114,We hope these recommendations could benefit the professionals of the same occupation as us and related hospital managers, improve the treatment of burn during the outbreak of the COVID-19, and avoid or reduce the risk of infection of medical staff .
32111114,新型冠状病毒属于β属的冠状病毒，是导致2019年严重疫情——新型冠状病毒肺炎暴发的元凶。
32111114,我国也已经正式将新型冠状病毒肺炎纳入《中华人民共和国传染病防治法》规定的乙类传染病，并按甲类传染病进行管理。
32111114,目前仍是新型冠状病毒肺炎疫情防控的关键时期，作为急诊科室的烧伤科面临着严峻的风险。
32111114,为提高患者救治率，避免或减少医务人员感染，笔者依据国家最新发布的《新型冠状病毒肺炎诊疗方案（试行第六版）》，结合国内外最新的文献资料，根据新型冠状病毒肺炎基本特性和国家卫生健康委员会关于新型冠状病毒肺炎的防治建议，并参考兄弟学科的诊疗管理经验，在门急诊、住院治疗、手术及病区管理等方面提出指导新型冠状病毒肺炎疫情期间烧伤科诊疗工作的建议，希望对烧伤救治同道们和相关医院管理者有所裨益。.
32112549,Since the outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia in December 2019, the diagnosis and treatment of patients with cancer have been facing great challenges.
32112549,Although oncologists are not fighting on the front line to against the epidemic, during this special period, we should not only protect patients, their families and medical staff from the infection of novel Coronavirus, but also minimize the impact of the epidemic on the diagnosis and the treatment of patients with cancer.
32112549,Combining the guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of tumors with our clinical experience, in this epidemic period, we discuss the strategies for diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of malignant tumors of the digestive system in this article.
32112549,自2019年12月新型冠状病毒肺炎疫情暴发以来，肿瘤患者的诊治面临很大的挑战。
32112549,肿瘤专科医师虽然未亲临抗击疫情的一线，但是在这个特殊的时期，不仅需要兼顾患者及其家属和医护人员的健康安全，还要最大程度降低因疫情对肿瘤诊治产生的影响。
32112549,文章结合肿瘤诊疗指南和笔者的临床经验，对疫情期间消化系统肿瘤的诊断、治疗和随访策略进行探讨，以供读者参考。.
32112886,Since the first case of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection pneumonia was detected in Wuhan, China, a series of confirmed cases of the COVID-19 were found in Beijing.
32112886,We analyzed the data of 262 confirmed cases to determine the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in Beijing.
32112886,We collected patients who were transferred by Beijing Emergency Medical Service to the designated hospitals.
32112886,The information on demographic, epidemiological, clinical, laboratory test for the COVID-19 virus, diagnostic classification, cluster case and outcome were obtained.
32112886,Furthermore we compared the characteristics between severe and common confirmed cases which including mild cases, no-pneumonia cases and asymptomatic cases, and we also compared the features between COVID-19 and 2003 SARS.
32112886,By Feb 10, 2020, 262 patients were transferred from the hospitals across Beijing to the designated hospitals for special treatment of the COVID-19 infected by Beijing emergency medical service.
32112886,Among of 262 patients, 46 (17.6%) were severe cases, 216 (82.4%) were common cases, which including 192 (73.3%) mild cases, 11(4.2%) non-pneumonia cases and 13 (5.0%) asymptomatic cases respectively.
32112886,The median age of patients was 47.5 years old and 48.5% were male.
32112886,192 (73.3%) patients were residents of Beijing, 50 (26.0%) of which had been to Wuhan, 116 (60.4%) had close contact with confirmed cases, 21 (10.9%) had no contact history.
32112886,The most common symptoms at the onset of illness were fever (82.1%), cough (45.8%), fatigue (26.3%), dyspnea (6.9%) and headache (6.5%).
32112886,The median incubation period was 6.7 days, the interval time from between illness onset and seeing a doctor was 4.5 days.
32112886,As of Feb 10, 17.2% patients have discharged and 81.7% patients remain in hospital in our study, the fatality of COVID-19 infection in Beijing was 0.9%.
32112886,On the basis of this study, we provided the ratio of the COVID-19 infection on the severe cases to the mild, asymptomatic and non-pneumonia cases in Beijing.
32112886,Population was generally susceptible, and with a relatively low fatality rate.
32112886,The measures to prevent transmission was very successful at early stage, the next steps on the COVID-19 infection should be focused on early isolation of patients and quarantine for close contacts in families and communities in Beijing.
32112886,Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission and Ministry of Science and Technology.
32113704,Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-COV2 and represents the causative agent of a potentially fatal disease that is of great global public health concern.
32113704,Based on the large number of infected people that were exposed to the wet animal market in Wuhan City, China, it is suggested that this is likely the zoonotic origin of COVID-19.
32113704,Person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 infection led to the isolation of patients that were subsequently administered a variety of treatments.
32113704,Extensive measures to reduce person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 have been implemented to control the current outbreak.
32113704,Special attention and efforts to protect or reduce transmission should be applied in susceptible populations including children, health care providers, and elderly people.
32113704,In this review, we highlights the symptoms, epidemiology, transmission, pathogenesis, phylogenetic analysis and future directions to control the spread of this fatal disease.
32113824,An outbreak of respiratory illness proved to be infected by a 2019 novel coronavirus, officially named Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), was notified first in Wuhan, China, and has spread rapidly in China and to other parts of the world.
32113824,Herein, we reported the first confirmed case of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) imported from China in Taiwan.
32113824,This case report revealed a natural course of NCP with self-recovery, which may be a good example in comparison with medical treatments.
32113846,In this study we execute a rational screen to identify Chinese medical herbs that are commonly used in treating viral respiratory infections and also contain compounds that might directly inhibit 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), an ongoing novel coronavirus that causes pneumonia.
32113846,There were two main steps in the screening process.
32113846,In the first step we conducted a literature search for natural compounds that had been biologically confirmed as against sever acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus or Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus.
32113846,Resulting compounds were cross-checked for listing in the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database.
32113846,Compounds meeting both requirements were subjected to absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) evaluation to verify that oral administration would be effective.
32113846,Next, a docking analysis was used to test whether the compound had the potential for direct 2019-nCoV protein interaction.
32113846,In the second step we searched Chinese herbal databases to identify plants containing the selected compounds.
32113846,Plants containing 2 or more of the compounds identified in our screen were then checked against the catalogue for classic herbal usage.
32113846,Finally, network pharmacology analysis was used to predict the general in vivo effects of each selected herb.
32113846,Of the natural compounds screened, 13 that exist in traditional Chinese medicines were also found to have potential anti-2019-nCoV activity.
32113846,Further, 125 Chinese herbs were found to contain 2 or more of these 13 compounds.
32113846,Of these 125 herbs, 26 are classically catalogued as treating viral respiratory infections.
32113846,Network pharmacology analysis predicted that the general in vivo roles of these 26 herbal plants were related to regulating viral infection, immune/inflammation reactions and hypoxia response.
32113846,Chinese herbal treatments classically used for treating viral respiratory infection might contain direct anti-2019-nCoV compounds.
32114744,<b>Objective:</b> To investigate the clinical characteristics and placental pathology of 2019-nCoV infection in pregnancy, and to evaluate intrauterine vertical transmission potential of 2019-nCoV infection. <b>Methods:</b> The placentas delivered from pregnant women with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection which were received in the Department of Pathology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology collected by February 4th, 2020 and retrospectively studied.
32114744,Their clinical material including placental tissue and lung CT, and laboratory results were collected, meanwhile, nucleic acid detection of 2019-nCoV of the placentas were performed by RT-PCR. <b>Results:</b> Three placentas delivered from pregnant women with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection, who were all in their third trimester with emergency caesarean section.
32114744,All of the three patients presented with fever (one before caesarean and two in postpartum), and had no significant leukopenia and lymphopenia.
32114744,Neonatal throat swabs from three newborns were tested for 2019-nCoV, and all samples were negative for the nucleic acid of 2019-nCoV.
32114744,One premature infant was transferred to Department of Neonatology due to low birth weight.
32114744,By the end of February 25, 2020, none of the three patients developed severe 2019-nCoV pneumonia or died(two patients had been cured and discharged, while another one had been transferred to a square cabin hospital for isolation treatment).
32114744,There were various degrees of fibrin deposition inside and around the villi with local syncytial nodule increases in all three placentas.
32114744,One case of placenta showed the concomitant morphology of chorionic hemangioma and another one with massive placental infarction.
32114744,No pathological change of villitis and chorioamnionitis was observed in our observation of three cases.
32114744,All samples from three placentas were negative for the nucleic acid of 2019-nCoV. <b>Conclusions:</b> The clinical characteristics of pregnant women with 2019-nCoV infection in late pregnancy are similar to those of non-pregnant patients, and no severe adverse pregnancy outcome is found in the 3 cases of our observation.
32114744,Pathological study suggests that there are no morphological changes related to infection in the three placentas.
32114744,Currently no evidence for intrauterine vertical transmission of 2019-nCoV is found in the three women infected by 2019-nCoV in their late pregnancy. <b>目的：</b> 探讨新型冠状病毒（2019-nCoV）感染孕妇的临床特点及胎盘病理学变化，并评估有无宫内垂直传播的可能。
32114744,<b>方法：</b> 回顾性分析华中科技大学同济医学院附属协和医院病理科2020年2月4日接收的3例确诊2019-nCoV感染孕妇的患者资料，收集胎盘组织、肺部CT及实验室检查结果，同时采用逆转录-聚合酶链反应（RT-PCR）方法检测胎盘组织内2019-nCoV病毒核酸序列。
32114744,<b>结果：</b> 3例确诊2019-nCoV感染孕妇均为妊娠晚期，急诊入院行剖腹产手术分娩。
32114744,3例均伴有发热（1例产前发热，2例产后发热），不伴有明显的白细胞减少及淋巴细胞减少；3例新生儿咽拭子2019-nCoV核酸检测均为阴性，仅1例因早产儿低体重转入新生儿科；截至2020年2月25日，3例产妇均未进展为重症或死亡（2例治愈出院，1例转至方舱医院隔离治疗）。
32114744,胎盘组织病理学分析显示1例合并绒毛膜血管瘤，另1例伴有多灶性梗死；3例镜下均有不同程度的绒毛间质内或绒毛周围纤维蛋白沉积，局部合胞体小结增多；未查见绒毛炎或绒毛膜羊膜炎。
32114744,3例胎盘组织2019-nCoV核酸检测均阴性。
32114744,<b>结论：</b> 该组3例妊娠晚期2019-nCoV感染孕妇的临床表现与非妊娠期患者相似，未发现严重不良妊娠结局；病理学分析提示胎盘组织缺乏病毒感染相关形态学改变，未发现宫内母胎垂直传播。.
32114747,Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has seriously affected the treatment of patients and social stability.
32114747,In the later stage of disease, some COVID-19 patients may develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome or even multiple organ failure.
32114747,However, one of the most important mechanism underlying the deterioration of disease is cytokine storm.
32114747,At present, some therapies such as interleukin-6 antibody blocker, stem cell therapy, and transfusion of convalescent plasma have been applied to counteract the cytokine storm and have made some progress.
32114747,This article reviews the influences of cytokine storm syndrome on the COVID-19 and the corresponding immunotherapies to resist cytokine storm.
32114747,新型冠状病毒肺炎（COVID-19）已严重影响了患者的生命安全和社会稳定。
32114747,部分COVID-19患者在疾病后期可发展为急性呼吸窘迫综合征、甚至多器官功能衰竭，而导致这一病情转变潜在的重要机制就是细胞因子风暴的产生。
32114747,目前，白细胞介素6抗体阻断剂、干细胞疗法和回输康复患者血清等方法缓解细胞因子风暴已取得一定进展。
32114747,本文就细胞因子风暴对COVID-19的影响及抵抗细胞因子风暴的免疫治疗方法进行综述。.
32115733,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) cause china epidemics with high morbidity and mortality, the infection has been transmitted to other countries.
32115733,About three neonates and more than 230 children cases are reported.
32115733,The disease condition of the main children was mild.
32115733,There is currently no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted transplacentally from mother to the newborn.
32115733,The treatment strategy for children with Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is based on adult experience.
32115733,Thus far, no deaths have been reported in the pediatric age group.
32115733,This review describes the current understanding of COVID-19 infection in newborns and children.
32117569,A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) originating in Wuhan, China presents a potential respiratory viral pandemic to the world population.
32117569,Current efforts are focused on containment and quarantine of infected individuals.
32117569,Ultimately, the outbreak could be controlled with a protective vaccine to prevent 2019-nCoV infection.
32117569,While vaccine research should be pursued intensely, there exists today no therapy to treat 2019-nCoV upon infection, despite an urgent need to find options to help these patients and preclude potential death.
32117569,Herein, I review the potential options to treat 2019-nCoV in patients, with an emphasis on the necessity for speed and timeliness in developing new and effective therapies in this outbreak.
32117569,I consider the options of drug repurposing, developing neutralizing monoclonal antibody therapy, and an oligonucleotide strategy targeting the viral RNA genome, emphasizing the promise and pitfalls of these approaches.
32117569,Finally, I advocate for the fastest strategy to develop a treatment now, which could be resistant to any mutations the virus may have in the future.
32117569,The proposal is a biologic that blocks 2019-nCoV entry using a soluble version of the viral receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), fused to an immunoglobulin Fc domain, providing a neutralizing antibody with maximal breath to avoid any viral escape, while also helping to recruit the immune system to build lasting immunity.
32117569,The sequence of the ACE2-Fc protein is provided to investigators, allowing its possible use in recombinant protein expression systems to start producing drug today to treat patients under compassionate use, while formal clinical trials are later undertaken.
32117569,Such a treatment could help infected patients before a protective vaccine is developed and widely available in the coming months to year(s).
32118389,<b>Objective:</b> To analyze the epidemiological history, clinical manifestations, treatment and the short-term prognosis of 31 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus(2019-nCoV) infection in children from six provinces (autonomous region) in northern China. <b>Methods:</b> A retrospective analysis of the epidemiological history, clinical symptoms, signs, laboratory examinations, chest imaging, treatment and the short-term prognosis of 31 cases of 2019-nCoV was conducted.

32118389,Nine cases (29%) were imported cases.
32118389,Other 21 cases (68%) had contact with confirmed infected adults.
32118389,One case (3%) had contact with asymptomatic returnees from Wuhan.
32118389,Among the 31 children, 28 patients (90%) were family cluster cases.
32118389,The clinical types were asymptomatic type in 4 cases (13%), mild type in 13 cases (42%), and common type in 14 cases (45%).
32118389,No severe or critical type existed.
32118389,The most common symptom was fever (<i>n</i>=20, 65%), including 1 case of high fever, 9 cases of moderate fever, 10 cases of low fever.
32118389,Fever lasted from 1 day to 9 days.
32118389,The fever of fifteen cases lasted for ≤3 d, while in other 5 cases lasted &gt; 3 d.
32118389,Other symptoms included cough (<i>n</i>=14, 45%), fatigue (<i>n</i>=3, 10%) and diarrhea (<i>n</i>=3, 9%).
32118389,Pharyngalgia, runny nose, dizziness, headache and vomiting were rare.
32118389,In the early stage, the total leukocytes count in peripheral blood decreased in 2 cases (6%), the lymphocytes count decreased in 2 cases (6%), and the platelet count increased in 2 cases (6%).
32118389,Elevation of C-reactive protein (10%, 3/30), erythrocyte sedimentation rate(19%,4/21), procalcitonin(4%,1/28), liver enzyme(22%, 6/27) and muscle enzyme (15%, 4/27) occurred in different proportions.
32118389,Renal function and blood glucose were normal.
32118389,There were abnormal chest CT changes in 14 cases, including 9 cases with patchy ground glass opacities and nodules, mostly located in the lower lobe of both lungs near the pleural area.
32118389,After receiving supportive treatment, the viral nucleic acid turned negative in 25 cases within 7-23 days.
32118389,Among them, 24 children (77%) recovered and were discharged from hospital.

32118391,With a large number of COVID-19 patients discharging from hospital, some had showed re-fever and positive nucleic acid test after discharge from hospital.
32118391,This might be due to the biological characteristics of 2019-nCoV, and might also be related to the basic disease, clinical status, glucocorticoid using, sample sampling, processing and detecting of patients, and some even related to the re-infection or secondary bacterial virus infection.
32118391,Therefore, we suggest that in view of this phenomenon, further stratified management of discharge from hospital should be carried out on the basis of guidelines, especially for patients with advanced age, underlying diseases or severe or critical pneumonia.
32118391,For those patients who can't completely deoxygenate for a long time after hospitalization, individualized treatment methods and different discharge evaluation criteria should be adopted to ensure the complete cure of patients and prevent recurrencing after discharge from hospital.
32118391,随着新型冠状病毒肺炎（COVID-19）患者大量出院，部分患者出院后出现再次发热、核酸检测阳性的现象。
32118391,这可能是由于新型冠状病毒（2019-nCoV）的生物学特性所决定的，也可能与患者的基础疾病、临床状况、糖皮质激素的使用以及标本采样、处理、检测有关，甚至还与部分患者再次感染或继发其他细菌病毒感染有关。
32118391,为此，我们建议针对这一现象，应在指南基础上进一步对患者出院进行分层管理，尤其是高龄、有基础疾病或重症及危重型患者可能要进行相应处理措施，对于患者住院后长期吸氧难以完全脱氧者采用个体化的处理方式和不同出院评估标准，旨在保证彻底治愈患者，防止出院后&quot;复发&quot;。.
32118394,With the increasing number of cases and widening geographical spread, the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been classified as one of the class B infectious diseases but prevented and controlled as class A infectious disease by the National Health Commission of China.
32118394,The diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer patients have been challenged greatly because of extraordinary public health measures since the lung cancer patients are a high-risk population during the COVID-19 outbreak period.
32118394,Strict protection for lung cancer patients is needed to avoid infection.
32118394,Lung cancer patients are difficult to differentiate from patients with COVID-19 in terms of clinical symptoms, which will bring great trouble to the clinical work and physical and mental health of lung cancer patients.
32118394,This review will demonstrate how to applicate appropriate and individual management for lung cancer patients to protect them from COVID-19.
32118394,随着新型冠状病毒肺炎（简称新冠肺炎）病例报告的增加，国家卫生健康委员会将新冠肺炎纳入乙类传染病，按照甲类传染病进行管理。
32118394,在全国各地新冠肺炎防控工作开展的同时，肺癌患者的诊疗工作在新的疫情下受到了极大的挑战。
32118394,肺癌患者在新冠肺炎疫情下属于高危人群，需要严密防护，避免感染。
32118394,新冠肺炎患者与肺癌患者在临床症状之间易于混淆，这将给肺癌患者的鉴别诊断以及身心健康带来极大的困扰。

32118639,A patient's infectivity is determined by the presence of the virus in different body fluids, secretions, and excreta.
32118639,The persistence and clearance of viral RNA from different specimens of patients with 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) remain unclear.
32118639,This study analyzed the clearance time and factors influencing 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) RNA in different samples from patients with COVID-19, providing further evidence to improve the management of patients during convalescence.
32118639,The clinical data and laboratory test results of convalescent patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to from January 20, 2020 to February 10, 2020 were collected retrospectively.
32118639,The reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results for patients' oropharyngeal swab, stool, urine, and serum samples were collected and analyzed.
32118639,Convalescent patients refer to recovered non-febrile patients without respiratory symptoms who had two successive (minimum 24 h sampling interval) negative RT-PCR results for viral RNA from oropharyngeal swabs.
32118639,The effects of cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4)+ T lymphocytes, inflammatory indicators, and glucocorticoid treatment on viral nucleic acid clearance were analyzed.
32118639,In the 292 confirmed cases, 66 patients recovered after treatment and were included in our study.
32118639,In total, 28 (42.4%) women and 38 men (57.6%) with a median age of 44.0 (34.0-62.0) years were analyzed.
32118639,After in-hospital treatment, patients' inflammatory indicators decreased with improved clinical condition.
32118639,The median time from the onset of symptoms to first negative RT-PCR results for oropharyngeal swabs in convalescent patients was 9.5 (6.0-11.0) days.
32118639,By February 10, 2020, 11 convalescent patients (16.7%) still tested positive for viral RNA from stool specimens and the other 55 patients' stool specimens were negative for 2019-nCoV following a median duration of 11.0 (9.0-16.0) days after symptom onset.
32118639,Among these 55 patients, 43 had a longer duration until stool specimens were negative for viral RNA than for throat swabs, with a median delay of 2.0 (1.0-4.0) days.
32118639,Results for only four (6.9%) urine samples were positive for viral nucleic acid out of 58 cases; viral RNA was still present in three patients' urine specimens after throat swabs were negative.
32118639,Using a multiple linear regression model (F = 2.669, P = 0.044, and adjusted R = 0.122), the analysis showed that the CD4+ T lymphocyte count may help predict the duration of viral RNA detection in patients' stools (t = -2.699, P = 0.010).
32118639,The duration of viral RNA detection from oropharyngeal swabs and fecal samples in the glucocorticoid treatment group was longer than that in the non-glucocorticoid treatment group (15 days vs.
32118639,8.0 days, respectively; t = 2.550, P = 0.013) and the duration of viral RNA detection in fecal samples in the glucocorticoid treatment group was longer than that in the non-glucocorticoid treatment group (20 days vs. 11 days, respectively; t = 4.631, P &lt; 0.001).
32118639,There was no statistically significant difference in inflammatory indicators between patients with positive fecal viral RNA test results and those with negative results (P &gt; 0.05).
32118639,In brief, as the clearance of viral RNA in patients' stools was delayed compared to that in oropharyngeal swabs, it is important to identify viral RNA in feces during convalescence.
32118639,Because of the delayed clearance of viral RNA in the glucocorticoid treatment group, glucocorticoids are not recommended in the treatment of COVID-19, especially for mild disease.
32118639,The duration of RNA detection may relate to host cell immunity.

32118640,C-reactive protein was significantly elevated in the progression group compared to the improvement/stabilization group (38.9 [14.3, 64.8] vs.
32118640,10.6 [1.9, 33.1] mg/L, U = 1.315, P = 0.024).
32118640,Albumin was significantly lower in the progression group than in the improvement/stabilization group (36.62 ± 6.60 vs.
32118640,41.27 ± 4.55 g/L, U = 2.843, P = 0.006).
32118640,Patients in the progression group were more likely to receive high-level respiratory support than in the improvement/stabilization group (χ = 16.01, P = 0.001).
32118640,Multivariate logistic analysis indicated that age (odds ratio [OR], 8.546; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.628-44.864; P = 0.011), history of smoking (OR, 14.285; 95% CI: 1.577-25.000; P = 0.018), maximum body temperature at admission (OR, 8.999; 95% CI: 1.036-78.147, P = 0.046), respiratory failure (OR, 8.772, 95% CI: 1.942-40.000; P = 0.016), albumin (OR, 7.353, 95% CI: 1.098-50.000; P = 0.003), and C-reactive protein (OR, 10.530; 95% CI: 1.224-34.701, P = 0.028) were risk factors for disease progression.
32118640,Several factors that led to the progression of COVID-19 pneumonia were identified, including age, history of smoking, maximum body temperature on admission, respiratory failure, albumin, C-reactive protein.
32118640,These results can be used to further enhance the ability of management of COVID-19 pneumonia.

32120929,<i>Strobilanthes cusia</i> (Nees) Kuntze is a Chinese herbal medicine used in the treatment of respiratory virus infections.
32120929,The methanol extract of <i>S. cusia</i> leaf contains chemical components such as β-sitosterol, indirubin, tryptanthrin, betulin, indigodole A, and indigodole B that have diverse biological activities.
32120929,However, the antiviral action of <i>S. cusia</i> leaf and its components against human coronavirus remains to be elucidated.
32120929,Human coronavirus NL63 infection is frequent among immunocompromised individuals, young children, and in the elderly.
32120929,This study investigated the anti-Human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) activity of the methanol extract of <i>S. cusia</i> leaf and its major components.
32120929,The methanol extract of <i>S. cusia</i> leaf effectively inhibited the cytopathic effect (CPE) and virus yield (IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.64 μg/mL) in HCoV-NL63-infected cells.
32120929,Moreover, this extract potently inhibited the HCoV-NL63 infection in a concentration-dependent manner.
32120929,Among the six components identified in the methanol extract of <i>S. cusia</i> leaf, tryptanthrin and indigodole B (5a<i>R</i>-ethyltryptanthrin) exhibited potent antiviral activity in reducing the CPE and progeny virus production.
32120929,The IC<sub>50</sub> values against virus yield were 1.52 μM and 2.60 μM for tryptanthrin and indigodole B, respectively.
32120929,Different modes of time-of-addition/removal assay indicated that tryptanthrin prevented the early and late stages of HCoV-NL63 replication, particularly by blocking viral RNA genome synthesis and papain-like protease 2 activity.
32120929,Notably, tryptanthrin (IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.06 μM) and indigodole B (IC<sub>50</sub> = 2.09 μM) exhibited strong virucidal activity as well.
32120929,This study identified tryptanthrin as the key active component of <i>S. cusia</i> leaf methanol extract that acted against HCoV-NL63 in a cell-type independent manner. <i>The results specify that tryptanthrin possesses antiviral potential</i> against HCoV-NL63 infection.
32125130,In order to achieve the overall victory of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease epidemic in this 'war', especially to prevent the disease recurrence from rebounding during the resumption of labor, the government has not loosened any control of personnel mobility, which has obviously affected the normal examination and treatment of lung cancer patients under the influence of this epidemic.
32125130,During the epidemic period, cancer patients with low immunity levels face the double ordeals of disease and epidemic situation.
32125130,Compared with the general population, they are more likely to be infected with the new coronavirus.
32125130,Among the infected cancer patients, lung cancer is the most common type.
32125130,It is necessary to provide more appropriate individualized treatment recommendations for patients with lung cancer based on the epidemic situation of the patient's location and in combination with the patient's own condition.
32125130,Through active prevention of infection, timely conversion of treatment strategies, online and offline joint control, and positive psychological counseling, we significantly hope to help patients with lung cancer to survive this difficult period.
32125130,为取得新型冠状病毒肺炎（COVID-19）战&quot;疫&quot;的全面胜利，特别是防止复工复产阶段的疫情反弹，社会各界对人员流动的管控仍无丝毫放松，肺癌患者的正常诊治在COVID-19疫情的影响下受到了巨大考验。
32125130,在疫情期间，免疫力水平低下的恶性肿瘤患者面临着疾病与疫情的双重考验，相比普通人群，其更容易感染2019新型冠状病毒；在被感染的恶性肿瘤患者中，肺癌是最常见的类型。
32125130,疫情期间需根据患者所在地的疫情现状，结合患者的自身情况，为肺癌患者提供更合适的个体化治疗建议，通过积极预防感染、及时的治疗策略转换、线上线下联合管控、积极的心理疏导等措施最大程度地帮助肺癌患者顺利度过这段艰难的时期。.
32125132,The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a public health emergency of major international concern.
32125132,Given the systemic immunosuppressive state caused by malignancy and anticancer treatments, patients with advanced lung cancer may be at a higher risk of COVID-19 infection.
32125132,During epidemic of COVID-19, a guideline for the optimal management of patients with advanced lung cancer urgently needs to be proposed to distinguish the symptoms of COVID-19 and the side effects of antitumor drugs.
32125132,This network questionnaire survey was conducted on the lung cancer group of the Chinese Thoracic Society, Chinese Medical Association; the lung cancer group of the Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology Youth Committee; and the Chinese Respiratory Oncology Collaboration. 321 valid questionnaires were received.
32125132,Based on the guidelines on lung cancer and the results of the questionnaires, a consensus was reached.
32125132,During the epidemic of COVID-19, We recommended that patients with advanced NSCLC should be treated as outpatients as possible at the nearest medical center; Patients who need to be hospitalized for antitumor treatment should be excluded from COVID-19 infection; More intensive attention should be paid to identification of COVID-19-related symptoms and adverse reactions caused by the malignancy or antitumor treatments.
32125132,Stronger personal protection should be made for advanced NSCLC patients; An intentional postponing of antitumor treatment should be considered according to patient performance status.
32125132,Treatment strategies should be made according to different types of advanced NSCLC patients and efficacy and toxicity of drugs.
32125132,新型冠状病毒肺炎（coronavirus disease 2019，COVID-19）仍在蔓延，疫情防控任务任重而道远。

32125140,The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) highlights an urgent need for therapeutics.
32125140,Through a series of drug repurposing screening campaigns, niclosamide, an FDA-approved anthelminthic drug, was found to be effective against various viral infections with nanomolar to micromolar potency such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, ZIKV, HCV, and human adenovirus, indicating its potential as an antiviral agent.
32125140,In this brief review, we summarize the broad antiviral activity of niclosamide and highlight its potential clinical use in the treatment of COVID-19.
32125362,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and has spread globally with sustained human-to-human transmission outside China.
32125362,To report the initial experience in Singapore with the epidemiologic investigation of this outbreak, clinical features, and management.
32125362,Descriptive case series of the first 18 patients diagnosed with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at 4 hospitals in Singapore from January 23 to February 3, 2020; final follow-up date was February 25, 2020.
32125362,Confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32125362,Clinical, laboratory, and radiologic data were collected, including PCR cycle threshold values from nasopharyngeal swabs and viral shedding in blood, urine, and stool.
32125362,Clinical course was summarized, including requirement for supplemental oxygen and intensive care and use of empirical treatment with lopinavir-ritonavir.
32125362,Among the 18 hospitalized patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (median age, 47 years; 9 [50%] women), clinical presentation was an upper respiratory tract infection in 12 (67%), and viral shedding from the nasopharynx was prolonged for 7 days or longer among 15 (83%).
32125362,Six individuals (33%) required supplemental oxygen; of these, 2 required intensive care.
32125362,There were no deaths.
32125362,Virus was detectable in the stool (4/8 [50%]) and blood (1/12 [8%]) by PCR but not in urine.
32125362,Five individuals requiring supplemental oxygen were treated with lopinavir-ritonavir.
32125362,For 3 of the 5 patients, fever resolved and supplemental oxygen requirement was reduced within 3 days, whereas 2 deteriorated with progressive respiratory failure.
32125362,Four of the 5 patients treated with lopinavir-ritonavir developed nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea, and 3 developed abnormal liver function test results.
32125362,Among the first 18 patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Singapore, clinical presentation was frequently a mild respiratory tract infection.
32125362,Some patients required supplemental oxygen and had variable clinical outcomes following treatment with an antiretroviral agent.
32125642,Currently there is no effective antiviral therapy for SARS-CoV-2 infection, which frequently leads to fatal inflammatory responses and acute lung injury.
32125642,Here, we discuss the various mechanisms of SARS-CoV-mediated inflammation.
32125642,We also assume that SARS-CoV-2 likely shares similar inflammatory responses.
32125642,Potential therapeutic tools to reduce SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammatory responses include various methods to block FcR activation.
32125642,In the absence of a proven clinical FcR blocker, the use of intravenous immunoglobulin to block FcR activation may be a viable option for the urgent treatment of pulmonary inflammation to prevent severe lung injury.
32125642,Such treatment may also be combined with systemic anti-inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids.
32125642,However, these strategies, as proposed here, remain to be clinically tested for effectiveness.
32129518,At the time of writing this commentary (February 2020), the coronavirus COVID-19 epidemic has already resulted in more fatalities compared with the SARS and MERS coronavirus epidemics combined.
32129518,Therapeutics that may assist to contain its rapid spread and reduce its high mortality rates are urgently needed.
32129518,Developing vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 virus may take many months.
32129518,Moreover, vaccines based on viral-encoded peptides may not be effective against future coronavirus epidemics, as virus mutations could make them futile.
32129518,Indeed, new Influenza virus strains emerge every year, requiring new immunizations.
32129518,A tentative suggestion based on existing therapeutics, which would likely be resistant to new coronavirus mutations, is to use available angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1R) blockers, such as losartan, as therapeutics for reducing the aggressiveness and mortality from SARS-CoV-2 virus infections.
32129518,This idea is based on observations that the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) very likely serves as the binding site for SARS-CoV-2, the strain implicated in the current COVID-19 epidemic, similarly to strain SARS-CoV implicated in the 2002-2003 SARS epidemic.
32129518,This commentary elaborates on the idea of considering AT1R blockers as tentative treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infections, and proposes a research direction based on datamining of clinical patient records for assessing its feasibility.
32129583,<b>Objective:</b> To identify the characteristics including clinical features and pulmonary computed tomography (CT) features of heart failure and novel coronavirus pneumonia(COVID-19). <b>Methods:</b> This study was a retrospective study.
32129583,A total of 7 patients with Heart failure and 12 patients with COVID-19 in the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University between December 1, 2019 and February 15, 2020 were enrolled.
32129583,The baseline clinical and imaging features of the two groups were statistically analyzed. <b>Results:</b> There was no significant difference in age and sex between the two groups, but the incidence of epidemiological contact history, fever or respiratory symptoms in the COVID-19 group was significantly higher than that in the heart failure group (12/12 vs. 2/7, <i>P</i>=0.001; 12/12 vs. 4/7, <i>P</i>&lt;0.001).
32129583,While the proportion of cardiovascular diseases and impaired cardiac function was significantly less than that of the heart failure group(2/12 vs.7/7, <i>P</i>&lt;0.001; 0/12 vs.7/7, <i>P</i>&lt;0.001).
32129583,For imaging features, both groups had ground-glass opacity and thickening of interlobular septum, but the ratio of central and gradient distribution was higher in patients with heart failure than that in patients with COVID-19 (4/7 vs. 1/12, <i>P</i>=0.04).
32129583,In heart failure group, the ratio of the expansion of small pulmonary veins was also higher (3/7 vs. 0, <i>P</i>=0.013), and the lung lesions can be significantly improved after effective anti-heart failure treatment.
32129583,Besides, there are more disease with rounded morphology in COVID-19 (9/12 vs.
32129583,2/7, P=0.048) . <b>Conclusions:</b> More patients with COVID-19 have epidemiological history and fever or respiratory symptoms.
32129583,There are significant differences in chest CT features, such as enlargement of pulmonary veins, lesions distribution and morphology between heart failure and COVID-19. <b>目的：</b> 对比心力衰竭及新型冠状病毒肺炎（COVID-19）患者临床及肺部影像学特征，总结二者的鉴别要点。
32129583,<b>方法：</b> 本研究为回顾性研究。
32129583,纳入中南大学湘雅二医院于2019年12月1日至2020年2月15日间收治的心力衰竭及COVID-19患者，排除病例资料不全者，共纳入心力衰竭患者7例，COVID-19患者12例。
32129583,比较两组的基线临床特征（包括性别、年龄、病史、实验室检查等）及肺部CT影像学特征。
32129583,<b>结果：</b> 两组间年龄、性别差异无统计学意义，COVID-19组流行病学接触史、发热或呼吸道症状比例明显高于心力衰竭组（12/12比2/7，<i>P</i>=0.001；12/12比4/7，<i>P</i>&lt;0.001）；合并心血管基础疾病、心功能受损比例则明显少于心力衰竭组（2/12比7/7，<i>P</i>&lt;0.001；0比7/7，<i>P</i>&lt;0.001）。
32129583,影像学方面，两组患者都可有磨玻璃影及小叶间隔增厚的特点。
32129583,但与COVID-19组比较，心力衰竭患者肺部病变呈中央型及阶梯状的比例（4/7比1/12，<i>P</i>=0.04）及小肺静脉扩张比例更高（3/7比0，<i>P</i>=0.013），且经有效抗心力衰竭治疗后肺部病变会明显快速改善。
32129583,此外，COVID-19患者肺部病变圆形或类圆形的比例高于心衰患者（9/12比2/7，<i>P</i>=0.048）。
32129583,<b>结论：</b> COVID-19患者流行病学接触史，发热和呼吸道症状明显。
32129583,在肺部CT影像学表现上，二者有相似之处，但病变分布特点、病变形态和肺静脉扩张情况有不同之处。.
32130038,<b>OBJECTIVE.</b> The objective of our study was to determine the misdiagnosis rate of radiologists for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and evaluate the performance of chest CT in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19.
32130038,The CT features of COVID-19 are reported and compared with the CT features of other viruses to familiarize radiologists with possible CT patterns. <b>MATERIALS AND METHODS.</b> This study included the first 51 patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 infection confirmed by nucleic acid testing (23 women and 28 men; age range, 26-83 years) and two patients with adenovirus (one woman and one man; ages, 58 and 66 years).
32130038,We reviewed the clinical information, CT images, and corresponding image reports of these 53 patients.
32130038,The CT images included images from 99 chest CT examinations, including initial and follow-up CT studies.
32130038,We compared the image reports of the initial CT study with the laboratory test results and identified CT patterns suggestive of viral infection. <b>RESULTS.</b> COVID-19 was misdiagnosed as a common infection at the initial CT study in two inpatients with underlying disease and COVID-19.
32130038,Viral pneumonia was correctly diagnosed at the initial CT study in the remaining 49 patients with COVID-19 and two patients with adenovirus.
32130038,These patients were isolated and obtained treatment.
32130038,Ground-glass opacities (GGOs) and consolidation with or without vascular enlargement, interlobular septal thickening, and air bronchogram sign are common CT features of COVID-19.
32130038,The The &quot;reversed halo&quot; sign and pulmonary nodules with a halo sign are uncommon CT features.
32130038,The CT findings of COVID-19 overlap with the CT findings of adenovirus infection.
32130038,There are differences as well as similarities in the CT features of COVID-19 compared with those of the severe acute respiratory syndrome. <b>CONCLUSION.</b> We found that chest CT had a low rate of missed diagnosis of COVID-19 (3.9%, 2/51) and may be useful as a standard method for the rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 to optimize the management of patients.
32130038,However, CT is still limited for identifying specific viruses and distinguishing between viruses.

32134278,Last decade witnessed the outbreak of many life-threatening human pathogens including Nipah, Ebola, Chikungunya, Zika, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Severe Acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and more recently novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV or SARS-CoV-2).
32134278,The disease condition associated with novel coronavirus, referred to as Coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
32134278,The emergence of novel coronavirus in 2019 in Wuhan, China marked the third highly pathogenic coronavirus infecting humans in the 21st century.
32134278,The continuing emergence of coronaviruses at regular intervals poses a significant threat to human health and economy.
32134278,Ironically, even after a decade of research on coronavirus, still there are no licensed vaccines or therapeutic agents to treat coronavirus infection which highlights an urgent need to develop effective vaccines or post-exposure prophylaxis to prevent future epidemics.
32134278,Several clinical, genetic and epidemiological features of COVID-19 resemble SARS-CoV infection.
32134278,Hence, the research advancements on SARS-CoV treatment might help scientific community in quick understanding of this virus pathogenesis and develop effective therapeutic/prophylactic agents to treat and prevent this infection.
32134278,Monoclonal antibodies represent the major class of biotherapeutics for passive immunotherapy to fight against viral infection.
32134278,The therapeutic potential of monoclonal antibodies has been well recognized in the treatment of many diseases.
32134278,Here, we summarize the potential monoclonal antibody based therapeutic intervention for COVID-19 by considering the existing knowledge on the neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against similar coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
32134278,Further research on COVID-19 pathogenesis could identify appropriate therapeutic targets to develop specific anti-virals against this newly emerging pathogen.
32134800,In late December, 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China was caused by a novel coronavirus, newly named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32134800,We aimed to quantify severity of COVID-19 infection on High-Resolution CT and to determine its relationship with clinical parameters.
32134800,From Jan 11, 2020, to Feb 5, 2020, the clinical, laboratory and HRCT features of 42 patients (26-75 years, 25 males) with COVID-19 were analyzed.
32134800,The initial and follow-up CT obtained a mean of 4.5 days and 11.6 days from the illness onset were retrospectively assessed for the severity and progression of pneumonia.
32134800,Correlations among clinical parameters, initial CT features and progression of opacifications were evaluated with Spearman correlation and linear regression analysis.
32134800,Thirty-five (83%) patients exhibited a progressive process according to CT features during the early stage from onset.
32134800,Follow-up CT findings showed progressive opacifications, consolidation, interstitial thickening, fibrous strips and air bronchograms, compared to initial CT (all p&lt;0.05).
32134800,Before regular treatments, there was a moderate correlation between the days from onset and sum score of opacifications (R=0.68, p&lt;0.01).
32134800,The C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and lactate dehydrogenase showed significantly positive correlation with the severity of pneumonia assessed on initial CT (R range 0.36-0.75, p&lt;0.05).
32134800,The highest temperature and the severity of opacifications assessed on initial CT were significantly related to the progression of opacifications on follow-up CT (p=0.001-0.04).
32134800,Patients with the COVID-19 infection usually presented with typical ground-grass opacities and other CT features, which showed significant correlations with some clinical and laboratory measurements.
32134800,Follow-up CT images often demonstrated progressions during the early stage from illness onset.
32134861,In late December 2019, a previous unidentified coronavirus, currently named as the 2019 novel coronavirus#, emerged from Wuhan, China, and resulted in a formidable outbreak in many cities in China and expanded globally, including Thailand, Republic of Korea, Japan, United States, Philippines, Viet Nam, and our country (as of 2/6/2020 at least 25 countries).
32134861,The disease is officially named as Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19, by WHO on February 11, 2020).
32134861,It is also named as Severe Pneumonia with Novel Pathogens on January 15, 2019 by the Taiwan CDC, the Ministry of Health and is a notifiable communicable disease of the fifth category.
32134861,COVID-19 is a potential zoonotic disease with low to moderate (estimated 2%-5%) mortality rate.
32134861,Person-to-person transmission may occur through droplet or contact transmission and if there is a lack of stringent infection control or if no proper personal protective equipment available, it may jeopardize the first-line healthcare workers.
32134861,Currently, there is no definite treatment for COVID-19 although some drugs are under investigation.
32134861,To promptly identify patients and prevent further spreading, physicians should be aware of the travel or contact history of the patient with compatible symptoms.
32141058,As of Feb 15, 2020, the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has rapidly spread throughout China and across the world with more than 60,000 laboratory-confirmed cases.
32141058,Due to the current lack of specific treatment and the risk of transmission during the viral incubation period, infection prevention and control of 2019-nCoV are both urgent and critical to global health.
32141058,In this article, we aim to highlight the necessity of implementing protective measures, and recommend how to set proper emergency management plans for preventing and controlling nosocomial infection of 2019-nCoV in dermatology departments.
32141619,2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which originated in Wuhan, China, has attracted the world's attention over the last month.
32141619,The Chinese government has taken emergency measures to control the outbreak and has undertaken initial steps in the diagnosis and treatment of 2019 novel coronavirus infection disease (COVID-19).
32141619,However, SARS-CoV-2 possesses powerful pathogenicity as well as transmissibility and still holds many mysteries that are yet to be solved, such as whether the virus can be transmitted by asymptomatic patients or by mothers to their infants.
32141619,Our research presents selected available cases of COVID-19 in China to better understand the transmission and diagnosis regarding this infectious disease.
32141624,Using the parameterized susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model, we simulated the spread dynamics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak and impact of different control measures, conducted the sensitivity analysis to identify the key factor, plotted the trend curve of effective reproductive number (R), and performed data fitting after the simulation.
32141624,By simulation and data fitting, the model showed the peak existing confirmed cases of 59 769 arriving on 15 February 2020, with the coefficient of determination close to 1 and the fitting bias 3.02%, suggesting high precision of the data-fitting results.
32141624,More rigorous government control policies were associated with a slower increase in the infected population.
32141624,Isolation and protective procedures would be less effective as more cases accrue, so the optimization of the treatment plan and the development of specific drugs would be of more importance.
32141624,There was an upward trend of R in the beginning, followed by a downward trend, a temporary rebound, and another continuous decline.
32141624,The feature of high infectiousness for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) led to an upward trend, and government measures contributed to the temporary rebound and declines.
32141624,The declines of R could be exploited as strong evidence for the effectiveness of the interventions.
32141624,Evidence from the four-phase stringent measures showed that it was significant to ensure early detection, early isolation, early treatment, adequate medical supplies, patients' being admitted to designated hospitals, and comprehensive therapeutic strategy.
32141624,Collaborative efforts are required to combat the novel coronavirus, focusing on both persistent strict domestic interventions and vigilance against exogenous imported cases.
32142651,The recent emergence of the novel, pathogenic SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China and its rapid national and international spread pose a global health emergency.
32142651,Cell entry of coronaviruses depends on binding of the viral spike (S) proteins to cellular receptors and on S protein priming by host cell proteases.
32142651,Unravelling which cellular factors are used by SARS-CoV-2 for entry might provide insights into viral transmission and reveal therapeutic targets.
32142651,Here, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 uses the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 for entry and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming.
32142651,A TMPRSS2 inhibitor approved for clinical use blocked entry and might constitute a treatment option.
32142651,Finally, we show that the sera from convalescent SARS patients cross-neutralized SARS-2-S-driven entry.
32142651,Our results reveal important commonalities between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection and identify a potential target for antiviral intervention.
32143502,Coronaviruses (CoVs) are RNA viruses that have become a major public health concern since the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-CoV (SARS-CoV) outbreak in 2002.
32143502,The continuous evolution of coronaviruses was further highlighted with the emergence of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-CoV (MERS-CoV) outbreak in 2012.
32143502,Currently, the world is concerned about the 2019 novel CoV (SARS-CoV-2) that was initially identified in the city of Wuhan, China in December 2019.
32143502,Patients presented with severe viral pneumonia and respiratory illness.
32143502,The number of cases has been mounting since then.
32143502,As of late February 2020, tens of thousands of cases and several thousand deaths have been reported in China alone, in addition to thousands of cases in other countries.
32143502,Although the fatality rate of SARS-CoV-2 is currently lower than SARS-CoV, the virus seems to be highly contagious based on the number of infected cases to date.
32143502,In this review, we discuss structure, genome organization, entry of CoVs into target cells, and provide insights into past and present outbreaks.
32143502,The future of human CoV outbreaks will not only depend on how the viruses will evolve, but will also depend on how we develop efficient prevention and treatment strategies to deal with this continuous threat.
32145185,The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a lethal zoonotic pathogen that was first identified in humans in Saudi Arabia and Jordan in 2012.
32145185,Intermittent sporadic cases, community clusters, and nosocomial outbreaks of MERS-CoV continue to occur.
32145185,Between April 2012 and December 2019, 2499 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including 858 deaths (34·3% mortality) were reported from 27 countries to WHO, the majority of which were reported by Saudi Arabia (2106 cases, 780 deaths).
32145185,Large outbreaks of human-to-human transmission have occurred, the largest in Riyadh and Jeddah in 2014 and in South Korea in 2015.
32145185,MERS-CoV remains a high-threat pathogen identified by WHO as a priority pathogen because it causes severe disease that has a high mortality rate, epidemic potential, and no medical countermeasures.
32145185,This Seminar provides an update on the current knowledge and perspectives on MERS epidemiology, virology, mode of transmission, pathogenesis, diagnosis, clinical features, management, infection control, development of new therapeutics and vaccines, and highlights unanswered questions and priorities for research, improved management, and prevention.
32145714,<b>Objective:</b> To study the effect of COVID-19 on pregnancy outcomes and neonatal prognosis in Hubei Province. <b>Methods:</b> A retrospective comparison of the pregnancy outcomes was done between 16 women with COVID-19 and 45 women without COVID-19.
32145714,Also, the results of laboratory tests, imaging examinations, and the 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test were performed in 10 cases of neonatal deliverd from women with COVID-19. <b>Results:</b> (1) Of the 16 pregnant women with COVID-19, 15 cases were ordinary type and 1 case was severe type.
32145714,No one has progressed to critical pneumonia.
32145714,The delivery method of the two groups was cesarean section, and the gestational age were (38.7±1.4) and (37.9±1.6) weeks, there was no significant difference between the two groups (<i>P</i>&gt; 0.05).
32145714,Also, there wee no significant differences in the intraoperative blood loss and birth weight of the newborn between the two groups (all <i>P</i>&gt;0.05).
32145714,(2) Ten cases of neonates delivered from pregnant women with COVID-19 were collected.
32145714,The 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test were all negative.
32145714,There were no significant differences in fetal distress, meconium-stained amniotic fluid, preterm birth, and neonatal asphyxia between the two groups (all <i>P</i>&gt;0.05).
32145714,(3) In the treatment of uterine contraction fatigue, carbetocin or carboprost tromethamine was used more in cesarean section for pregnant women with COVID-19 (1.3±0.6), compared with Non-COVID-19 group (0.5±0.7), the difference was statistically significant (<i>P</i>=0.001). <b>Conclusions:</b> If there is an indication for obstetric surgery or critical illness of COVID-19 in pregnant women, timely termination of pregnancy will not increase the risk of premature birth and asphyxia of the newborn, but it is beneficial to the treatment and rehabilitation of maternal pneumonia.
32145714,Preventive use of long-acting uterotonic agents could reduce the incidence of postpartum hemorrhage during surgery. 2019-nCoV infection has not been found in neonates deliverd from pregnant women with COVID-19. <b>目的：</b> 研究湖北地区新型冠状病毒肺炎感染对孕产妇的妊娠结局及新生儿预后的影响。
32145714,<b>方法：</b> 回顾性对比16例妊娠合并新型冠状病毒肺炎孕妇与45例未合并新型冠状病毒肺炎孕妇的妊娠结局，同时对10例新型冠状病毒肺炎孕妇分娩的新生儿实验室检查、影像学检查及新型冠状病毒核酸检查结果进行分析。
32145714,<b>结果：</b> （1）16例新型冠状病毒肺炎孕妇中普通型15例、重型1例，目前尚无一例进展为危重型肺炎。
32145714,两组孕产妇的分娩方式均为剖宫产术分娩，分娩孕周分别为（38.7±1.4）周、（37.9±1.6）周，两组比较，差异无统计学意义（<i>P</i>&gt;0.05）。
32145714,两组孕妇的术中出血量、新生儿出生体重分别比较，差异均无统计学意义（<i>P</i>均&gt;0.05）。（

32145714,<b>结论：</b> 有产科手术指征或孕妇新型冠状病毒肺炎病情危重的情况下，适时终止妊娠不会增加新生儿窒息及早产的风险，但有利于产妇肺炎病情的治疗及康复；术中预防性使用长效宫缩剂可减少产后出血的发生。
32145714,妊娠合并新型冠状病毒肺炎分娩的新生儿未发现新型冠状病毒感染。.
32145716,Since December 2019, Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19), a new emerging infection disease occurred in Wuhan, has spread in 27 countries and regions.
32145716,The clusters of many cases were reported with the epidemic progresses.
32145716,We collected currently available information for 377 COVID-19 clusters (1 719 cases), excluded the hospital clusters and Hubei cases, during the period from January 1, 2020 to February 20, 2020.
32145716,There were 297 family clusters (79%), case median 4; 39 clusters of dining (10%), case median 5; 23 clusters of shopping malls or supermarkets (6%), case median 13; 12 clusters of work units (3%), case median 6, and 6 clusters of transportation.
32145716,We selected 325 cases to estimate the incubation period and found its range is 1 to 20 days, median was 7 days, and mode was 4 days.
32145716,The analysis of the epidemic situation in a department store in China indicates that there is a possibility of patients as the source of infection during the incubation period of the epidemic.
32145716,From February 5, 2020 to February 21, 2020, 634 persons were infected in the Diamond Princess Liner.
32145716,All persons are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
32145716,The older, patients during the incubation period and the worse environment may be the cause of the cases rising.
32145716,The progress of the two typical outbreaks clearly demonstrates the spread of the early cases in Wuhan.
32145716,Whatever happens, screening and isolating close contacts remains essential except for clinical treatment during the epidemic.
32145716,Especially for the healthy people in the epidemic area, isolation is the key.
32145716,新型冠状病毒肺炎作为新发传染病，自2019年12月武汉发生以来，疫情已经波及27个国家和地区。
32145716,随着疫情的发展，聚集性疫情所占的发病数比例不断增加，尤其是武汉和湖北以外地区，暴露来源发生很大变化。
32145716,本研究收集2020年1月1日至2月20日期间非医疗机构新型冠状病毒肺炎聚集性疫情377起（涉及病例1 719例），家庭聚集性疫情297起（占79%），确诊病例中位数为4例；聚餐39起（占10%），确诊病例中位数为5例；商场或超市23起（占6%），确诊病例中位数为13例；工作单位12起（占3%），确诊病例中位数为6例；交通工具6起（占2%），确诊病例中位数为6例。
32145716,依聚集性病例潜伏期估计所需条件，选出325例，推测潜伏期为1～20 d，中位数为7 d，众数为4 d。
32145716,此外，对国内某百货大楼聚集疫情分析结果提示本次疫情潜伏期患者可能成为传染源。
32145716,&quot;钻石公主&quot;号邮轮聚集疫情从2月5－21日共634人被确诊感染，各类人群（国籍、年龄、性别）均易感，提示乘客年龄、无症状感染及邮轮内封闭环境可能是导致邮轮后续病例出现间歇同源暴露和人传人增殖模式的主要原因，两起典型疫情的进展清晰地展现了武汉早期病例的播散情况。
32145716,因此，在疫情防控中，除隔离患者外，追踪、排查和隔离密切接触者及次级接触者至关重要；尤其对于疫区的健康人群，自我隔离是关键。.
32145718,The <i>'Healing the Schism: Epidemiology, Medicine, and the Public's Health'</i> by professor Kerr L.
32145718,White's be published has a history of nearly 30 years.
32145718,Since then, although scholars have appealed to incorporating public health and clinical medicine education, and breaking down separations between public health and clinical workforce in China, the effect is yet not so obvious.
32145718,The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has opened a public class on the treatment, prevention and control of infectious diseases for the Chinese citizens.
32145718,Consequently, the Chinese people have higher expectations on the modernization of public health governance, and the social atmosphere of incorporating preventive medicine and clinical medical education is establishing.
32145718,In future, when combating with novel infectious diseases and public health emergencies, the response capacity of public health system and treatment capacity of clinical system will be significantly improved, while the situation on insufficient integration of prevention and treatment is bound to be reversed.
32145718,《弥合裂痕——流行病学、医学和公共卫生》问世已有近30年的历史，虽有有识之士不断呼吁在中国医学教育中加强公共卫生与临床医学的彼此融合，公共卫生专业工作者与临床医生之间应解除藩篱，但效果不甚明显。
32145718,新型冠状病毒肺炎（COVID-19）疫情使全民接受了一场传染病救治和防控的&quot;公开课&quot;，公众对我国公共卫生治理有了更高的期盼，公共卫生与临床医学教育弥合裂痕的社会氛围正在形成。
32145718,未来在抗击新的重大传染病疫情和突发公共卫生事件时，我国公共卫生系统响应能力和临床救治能力必将显著提高，医防融合不足的局面势必得以扭转。.
32147496,Recent publications have brought attention to the possible benefit of chloroquine, a broadly used antimalarial drug, in the treatment of patients infected by the novel emerged coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).
32147496,The scientific community should consider this information in light of previous experiments with chloroquine in the field of antiviral research.
32147628,The SARS-CoV-2 virus emerged in December 2019 and then spread rapidly worldwide, particularly to China, Japan, and South Korea.
32147628,Scientists are endeavoring to find antivirals specific to the virus.
32147628,Several drugs such as chloroquine, arbidol, remdesivir, and favipiravir are currently undergoing clinical studies to test their efficacy and safety in the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China; some promising results have been achieved thus far.
32147628,This article summarizes agents with potential efficacy against SARS-CoV-2.
32149769,Medicines for the treatment of 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infections are urgently needed.
32149769,However, drug screening using live 2019-nCoV requires high-level biosafety facilities, which imposes an obstacle for those without such facilities or 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
32149769,This study aims to repurpose the clinically approved drugs for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a 2019-nCoV related coronavirus model.
32149769,A 2019-nCoV related pangolin coronavirus GX_P2V/pangolin/2017/ Guangxi was described.
32149769,Whether GX_P2X uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the cell receptor was investigated by using small interfering RNA (siRNA) -mediated silencing of ACE2.
32149769,The pangolin coronavirus model was used to identify drug candidates for treating 2019-nCoV infection.
32149769,Two libraries of 2406 clinically approved drugs were screened for their ability to inhibit cytopathic effects on Vero E6 cells by GX_P2X infection.
32149769,The antiviral activities and antiviral mechanisms of potential drugs were further investigated.
32149769,Viral yields of RNAs and infectious particles were quantified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and plaque assay, respectively.
32149769,The spike protein of coronavirus GX_P2V shares 92.2% amino acid identity with that of 2019-nCoV isolate Wuhan-hu-1, and uses ACE2 as the receptor for infection just like 2019-nCoV.
32149769,Three drugs-cepharanthine (CEP), selamectin and mefloquine hydrochloride exhibited complete inhibition of cytopathic effects in cell culture at 10 μmol/L.
32149769,CEP demonstrated the most potent inhibition of GX_P2V infection, with a concentration for 50% of maximal effect [EC50] of 0.98 μmol/L.
32149769,The viral RNA yield in cells treated with 10 μmol/L CEP was 15,393-fold lower than in cells without CEP treatment ([6.48 ± 0.02] × 10vs.
32149769,1.00 ± 0.12, t = 150.38, P &lt; 0.001) at 72 h post-infection (p.i.).
32149769,Plaque assays found no production of live viruses in media containing 10 μmol/L CEP at 48 h p.i.
32149769,Furthermore, we found CEP has potent antiviral activities against both viral entry (1.00 ± 0.37 vs.
32149769,0.46 ± 0.12, t = 2.42, P &lt; 0.05) and viral replication (1.00 ± 0.43 vs.
32149769,[6.18 ± 0.95] × 10, t = 3.98, P &lt; 0.05).
32149769,Our pangolin coronavirus GX_P2V is a workable model for 2019-nCoV research.
32149769,CEP, selamectin and mefloquine hydrochloride are potential drugs for treating 2019-nCoV infection.
32149769,Our results strongly suggest that CEP is a wide-spectrum inhibitor of pan-betacoronavirus, and clinical trial of CEP for treatment of 2019-nCoV infection is warranted.
32149773,At the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus outbreak emerged in Wuhan, China, and its causative organism has been subsequently designated the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
32149773,The virus has since rapidly spread to all provinces and autonomous regions of China, and to countries outside of China.
32149773,Patients who become infected with 2019-nCoV may initially develop mild upper respiratory tract symptoms.
32149773,However, a significant fraction of these patients goes on to subsequently develop serious lower respiratory disease.
32149773,The effectiveness of adjunctive glucocorticoid therapy uses in the management of 2019-nCoV infected patients with severe lower respiratory tract infections is not clear, and warrants further investigation.
32149773,The present study will be conducted as an open-labelled, randomised controlled trial.
32149773,We will enrol 48 subjects from Chongqing Public Health Medical Center.
32149773,Each eligible subject will be assigned to an intervention group (methylprednisolone via intravenous injection at a dose of 1-2mg/kg/day for 3 days) or a control group (no glucocorticoid use) randomly, at a 1:1 ratio.
32149773,Subjects in both groups will be invited for 28 days of follow-up which will be scheduled at 4 consecutive visit points.
32149773,We will use the clinical improvement rate as our primary endpoint.
32149773,Secondary endpoints include the timing of clinical improvement after intervention, duration of mechanical ventilation, duration of hospitalization, overall incidence of adverse events, as well as rate of adverse events at each visit, and mortality at 2 and 4 weeks.
32149773,The present coronavirus outbreak is the third serious global coronavirus outbreak in the past two decades.
32149773,Oral and parenteral glucocorticoids have been used in the management of severe respiratory symptoms in coronavirus-infected patients in the past.
32149773,However, there remains no definitive evidence in the literature for or against the utilization of systemic glucocorticoids in seriously ill patients with coronavirus-related severe respiratory disease, or indeed in other types of severe respiratory disease.
32149773,In this study, we hope to discover evidence either supporting or opposing the systemic therapeutic administration of glucocorticoids in severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients.

32152082,Currently, the expansion of the novel human respiratory coronavirus (known as: SARS-CoV-2, COVID-2019, or 2019-nCoV) has stressed the need for therapeutic alternatives to alleviate and stop this new epidemic.
32152082,The previous epidemics of high-morbidity human coronaviruses, such as the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003, and the Middle East respiratory syndrome corona virus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, prompted the characterization of compounds that could be potentially active against the currently emerging novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
32152082,The most promising compound is remdesivir (GS-5734), a nucleotide analog prodrug currently in clinical trials for treating Ebola virus infections.
32152082,Remdesivir inhibited the replication of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in tissue cultures, and it displayed efficacy in non-human animal models.
32152082,In addition, a combination of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease inhibitors, lopinavir/ritonavir, and interferon beta (LPV/RTV-INFb) were shown to be effective in patients infected with SARS-CoV.
32152082,LPV/RTV-INFb also improved clinical parameters in marmosets and mice infected with MERS-CoV.
32152082,Remarkably, the therapeutic efficacy of remdesivir appeared to be superior to that of LPV/RTV-INFb against MERS-CoV in a transgenic humanized mice model.
32152082,The relatively high mortality rates associated with these three novel human coronavirus infections, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, has suggested that pro-inflammatory responses might play a role in the pathogenesis.
32152082,It remains unknown whether the generated inflammatory state should be targeted.
32152082,Therapeutics that target the coronavirus alone might not be able to reverse highly pathogenic infections.
32152082,This minireview aimed to provide a summary of therapeutic compounds that showed potential in fighting SARS-CoV-2 infections.
32152361,Network analysis to examine infectious contact relations provides an important means to uncover the topologies of individual infectious contact networks.
32152361,This study aims to investigate the spread of diseases among individuals over contact networks by exploring the 2015 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak in Korea.
32152361,We present several distinct features of MERS transmission by employing a comprehensive approach in network research to examine both the traced relationship matrix of infected individuals and their bipartite transmission routes among healthcare facilities visited for treatment.
32152361,The results indicate that a few super-spreaders were more likely to hold certain structural advantages by linking to an exceptional number of other individuals, causing several ongoing transmission events in neighbourhoods without the aid of any intermediary.
32152361,Thus, the infectious contact network exhibited small-world dynamics characterised by locally clustered contacts exposed to transmission paths via short path lengths.
32152361,In addition, nosocomial infection analysis shows the pattern of a common-source outbreak followed by secondary person-to-person transmission of the disease.
32152361,Based on the results, we suggest policy implications related to the redesign of prevention and control strategies against the spread of epidemics.
32153167,Novel coronavirus pneumonia was novel coronavirus infection that has dominated pulmonary infection since December 2019.
32153167,The main manifestations were fever, dry cough, shortness of breath, normal or leukopenia in peripheral blood and changes in chest CT and in severe cases, multiple organ failure might occur.
32153167,The National Health Commission, PRC has revised the consensus on diagnosis and treatment seven times in a short period of time, indicating the growing understanding of the disease.
32153167,Patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia usually had history of travelling or living in the epidemic area including Wuhan within 14 days before onset, or have been exposed to patients who had fever or respiratory symptoms from the epidemic area, or had clustering diseases.
32153167,However, novel coronavirus pneumonia was becoming more and more blurred after vanishing epidemic.
32153167,The diagnosis and differential diagnosis of novel coronavirus pneumonia was facing challenges not only because of large number of tourists increasing dramatically after the relieving of epidemic, but also patients with other diseases return from different areas to search for medical care.
32153167,In this article, the clinical and chest imaging features of the novel coronavirus pneumonia were reviewed and compared with other infections and non-infectious diffuse pulmonary diseases.
32153167,We were trying to find the similarities and differences among them, and to identify clues to the diagnosis of novel coronavirus pneumonia, so as to ensure accurate diagnosis and treatment.
32153167,2019年12月以来我国陆续出现新型冠状病毒（2019-nCoV）感染引起的以肺部病变为主的新型冠状病毒肺炎（简称新冠肺炎），主要临床表现为发热、干咳、气促、外周血白细胞不高或降低以及胸部CT改变等，严重者出现多脏器功能衰竭。
32153167,随着对本病的认识不断加深，近期内已连续6次修订诊疗方案。
32153167,新冠肺炎患者通常在发病前14天内有武汉或其他新冠肺炎传播地区的旅行史或居住史，或曾接触过来自疫区的发热或有呼吸道症状的患者，或为集聚发病。
32153167,但随着疫情逐渐得到控制，临床以呼吸道症状前来就诊的患者的流行病学史已越来越模糊，各级综合医院陆续面对新冠肺炎诊断和鉴别诊断的挑战。
32153167,现将新冠肺炎患者的临床表现及肺部影像学特征，与北京协和医院历年收治影像学表现为弥漫性肺病的其他肺部感染及非感染性疾病进行比较，尝试找出其相似及不同之处，为新冠肺炎鉴别提供线索，保证精准诊疗。.
32153170,<b>Objective:</b> To understand the clinical characteristics, change of liver function, influencing factors and prognosis in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) combined with liver injury. <b>Methods:</b> The general conditions, biochemical indicators of liver, blood clotting mechanism, routine blood test, UGT1A1 * 28 gene polymorphism and other data of 40 cases with COVID-19 admitted to the isolation ward of Tangdu Hospital were retrospectively analyzed.
32153170,The clinical characteristics, influencing factors and prognosis of liver injury in patients with liver injury group and those with normal liver function group were compared.
32153170,The mean of two samples in univariate analysis was compared by t-test and analysis of variance.
32153170,The counting data was measured by <i>χ</i>(2) tests.
32153170,The non-normal distribution measurement data were described by the median, and the non-parametric test was used.
32153170,Statistically significant influencing factors were used as the independent variables in univariate analysis.
32153170,Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the main influencing factors of liver injury. <b>Results:</b> Of the 40 cases, 25 were male (62.5%) and 15 were female (37.5%), aged 22 to 83 (53.87 ± 15.84) years.
32153170,Liver injury was occurred in 22 cases (55%) during the course of the disease.
32153170,Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level was initially increased (4.4 to 3.5 times of the normal value) along with decrease of albumin in the second week, and the difference was statistically significant (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001).
32153170,Ten cases (43.5%) had highest abnormal total blood bilirubin (54.1 μmol/ L).
32153170,There was no correlation between the increase in transaminase and the increase in total blood bilirubin (<i>R</i> = -0.006, <i>P</i> = 0.972).
32153170,Three cases had prothrombin activity (PTA) of ≤ 50%, 10 cases had elevated FDP, and 13 cases had elevated D-dimer, all of whom were severe or critically ill.
32153170,Liver function injury was more likely to occur in patients who used many types of drugs and large amounts of hormones (<i>P</i> = 0.002, <i>P</i> = 0.031), and there was no correlation with the TA6TA7 mutation in the UGT1A1 * 28 gene locus.
32153170,Multiple regression analysis showed that the occurrence of liver injury was only related to critical illness.
32153170,The liver function of all patients had recovered within one week after conventional liver protection treatment. <b>Conclusion:</b> COVID-19 combined with liver function injury may be due to the slight elevation of transaminase, mostly around the second week of the disease course.
32153170,Severe patients have a higher proportion of liver injury, and critical type is an independent risk factor for liver injury. <b>目的：</b> 了解新型冠状病毒肺炎（COVID-19）住院患者合并肝损伤的临床特点、肝功能变化、影响因素及预后。
32153170,<b>方法：</b> 回顾性分析唐都医院隔离病房收治的40例COVID-19患者的一般情况、肝脏生物化学指标、凝血、血常规、UGT1A1*28基因多态性等资料，比较肝损伤组与肝功能正常组患者的肝损伤临床特点、影响因素以及预后。
32153170,单因素分析中两样本均数比较采用<i>t</i>检验，两个以上采用方差分析，计数资料采用<i>χ</i>(2)检验，非正态分布计量资料以中位数描述，采用非参数检验。
32153170,单因素分析中有统计学意义的影响因素作为自变量，采用多元logistic回归分析影响肝损伤的主要因素。
32153170,<b>结果：</b> 40例患者中，男性25例（62.5%），女性15例（37.5%），年龄22 ～ 83（53.87±15.84）岁。
32153170,疾病过程中出现肝功能损害的22例（55%）。
32153170,患者丙氨酸转氨酶（ALT）和天冬氨酸转氨酶（AST）水平多在病程第2周开始升高，分别为正常值的4.4倍和3.5倍，伴同时段白蛋白下降，差异有统计学意义（<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001）。
32153170,血总胆红素(TBil)异常者10例（43.5％），最高54.1 μmol/L，转氨酶的升高和血总胆红素的升高无相关关系(<i>r</i> = -0.006，<i>P</i> = 0.972）。
32153170,3例患者凝血酶原活动度（PTA）低于50％，10例患者出现纤维蛋白降解产物（FDP）升高，13例出现D二聚体升高，均为重型或危重型患者。
32153170,肝功损害更易发生在使用药物种类多及使用激素量较大的患者中（<i>P</i> = 0.002， <i>P</i> = 0.031），与UGT1A1*28基因位点TA6TA7突变无相关性。
32153170,多元回归分析发现肝损伤发生仅与是否危重症相关。
32153170,经常规保肝治疗，所有患者肝功能均在1周内恢复正常。
32153170,<b>结论：</b> COVID-19可能合并肝功能损害，以轻度转氨酶升高为主，多发生于病程第2周前后。
32153170,重症患者发生肝损害比例更高，危重型是肝损伤发生的独立危险因素。.
32155789,<i>Background:</i> The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic is a public health emergency of international concern and poses a challenge to psychological resilience.
32155789,Research data are needed to develop evidence-driven strategies to reduce adverse psychological impacts and psychiatric symptoms during the epidemic.
32155789,The aim of this study was to survey the general public in China to better understand their levels of psychological impact, anxiety, depression, and stress during the initial stage of the COVID-19 outbreak.
32155789,The data will be used for future reference. <i>Methods:</i> From 31 January to 2 February 2020, we conducted an online survey using snowball sampling techniques.
32155789,The online survey collected information on demographic data, physical symptoms in the past 14 days, contact history with COVID-19, knowledge and concerns about COVID-19, precautionary measures against COVID-19, and additional information required with respect to COVID-19.
32155789,Psychological impact was assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and mental health status was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). <i>Results:</i> This study included 1210 respondents from 194 cities in China.
32155789,In total, 53.8% of respondents rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate or severe; 16.5% reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms; 28.8% reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms; and 8.1% reported moderate to severe stress levels.
32155789,Most respondents spent 20-24 h per day at home (84.7%); were worried about their family members contracting COVID-19 (75.2%); and were satisfied with the amount of health information available (75.1%).
32155789,Female gender, student status, specific physical symptoms (e.g., myalgia, dizziness, coryza), and poor self-rated health status were significantly associated with a greater psychological impact of the outbreak and higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05).
32155789,Specific up-to-date and accurate health information (e.g., treatment, local outbreak situation) and particular precautionary measures (e.g., hand hygiene, wearing a mask) were associated with a lower psychological impact of the outbreak and lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). <i>Conclusions:</i> During the initial phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, more than half of the respondents rated the psychological impact as moderate-to-severe, and about one-third reported moderate-to-severe anxiety.
32155789,Our findings identify factors associated with a lower level of psychological impact and better mental health status that can be used to formulate psychological interventions to improve the mental health of vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 epidemic.
32156101,The severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, has spread rapidly to over a dozen countries.
32156101,Especially, the spike of case numbers in South Korea sparks pandemic worries.
32156101,This virus is reported to spread mainly through personto- person contact via respiratory droplets generated by coughing and sneezing, or possibly through surface contaminated by people coughing or sneezing on them.
32156101,More critically, there have been reports about the possibility of this virus to transmit even before a virus-carrying person to show symptoms.
32156101,Therefore, a low-cost, easy-access protocol for early detection of this virus is desperately needed.
32156101,Here, we have established a real-time reverse-transcription PCR (rtPCR)-based assay protocol composed of easy specimen self-collection from a subject via pharyngeal swab, Trizolbased RNA purification, and SYBR Green-based rtPCR.
32156101,This protocol shows an accuracy and sensitivity limit of 1-10 virus particles as we tested with a known lentivirus.
32156101,The cost for each sample is estimated to be less than 15 US dollars.
32156101,Overall time it takes for an entire protocol is estimated to be less than 4 hours.
32156101,We propose a cost-effective, quick-and-easy method for early detection of SARS-CoV-2 at any conventional Biosafety Level II laboratories that are equipped with a rtPCR machine.
32156101,Our newly developed protocol should be helpful for a first-hand screening of the asymptomatic virus-carriers for further prevention of transmission and early intervention and treatment for the rapidly propagating virus.
32156648,Following the public-health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 30 January 2020 and the recent outbreak caused by 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) [officially renamed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)] in China and 29 other countries, we aimed to summarise the clinical aspects of the novelBetacoronavirus disease (COVID-19) and its possible clinical presentations together with suggested therapeutic algorithms for patients who may require antimicrobial treatment.
32156648,The currently available literature was reviewed for microbiologically confirmed infections by 2019-nCoV or COVID-19 at the time of writing (13 February 2020).
32156648,A literature search was performed using the PubMed database and Cochrane Library.
32156648,Search terms included 'novel coronavirus' or '2019-nCoV' or 'COVID-19'.
32156648,Published cases occurred mostly in males (age range, 8-92 years).
32156648,Cardiovascular, digestive and endocrine system diseases were commonly reported, except previous chronic pulmonary diseases [e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, bronchiectasis] that were surprisingly underreported.
32156648,Fever was present in all of the case series available, flanked by cough, dyspnoea, myalgia and fatigue.
32156648,Multiple bilateral lobular and subsegmental areas of consolidation or bilateral ground-glass opacities were the main reported radiological features of 2019-nCoV infection, at least in the early phases of the disease.
32156648,The new 2019-nCoV epidemic is mainly associated with respiratory disease and few extrapulmonary signs.
32156648,However, there is a low rate of associated pre-existing respiratory co-morbidities.
32157732,The human fragment crystallizable (Fc)γ receptor (R) interacts with antigen-complexed immunoglobulin (Ig)G ligands to both activate and modulate a powerful network of inflammatory host-protective effector functions that are key to the normal physiology of immune resistance to pathogens.
32157732,More than 100 therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are approved or in late stage clinical trials, many of which harness the potent FcγR-mediated effector systems to varying degrees.
32157732,This is most evident for antibodies targeting cancer cells inducing antibody-dependent killing or phagocytosis but is also true to some degree for the mAbs that neutralize or remove small macromolecules such as cytokines or other Igs.
32157732,The use of mAb therapeutics has also revealed a &quot;scaffolding&quot; role for FcγR which, in different contexts, may either underpin the therapeutic mAb action such as immune agonism or trigger catastrophic adverse effects.
32157732,The still unmet therapeutic need in many cancers, inflammatory diseases or emerging infections such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) requires increased effort on the development of improved and novel mAbs.
32157732,A more mature appreciation of the immunobiology of individual FcγR function and the complexity of the relationships between FcγRs and antibodies is fueling efforts to develop more potent &quot;next-gen&quot; therapeutic antibodies.
32157732,Such development strategies now include focused glycan or protein engineering of the Fc to increase affinity and/or tailor specificity for selective engagement of individual activating FcγRs or the inhibitory FcγRIIb or alternatively, for the ablation of FcγR interaction altogether.
32157732,This review touches on recent aspects of FcγR and IgG immunobiology and its relationship with the present and future actions of therapeutic mAbs.
32157862,Since December 2019, the outbreak of the novel coronavirus has impacted nearly &gt;90,000 people in more than 75 countries.
32157862,In this case report, we aim to define the chest computed tomography findings of 2019-novel coronavirus associated with pneumonia and its successful resolution after treatment.
32157862,A fifty-year-old female patient, who is a businesswoman, presented with chief complaints of “fever for one week, diarrhea, anorexia, and asthenia.”
32157862,Initially, she was given Tamiflu.
32157862,The influenza A virus serology was negative.
32157862,Three days later, levofloxacin was started because the patient’s symptoms did not improve.
32157862,The novel coronavirus nucleic acid test was negative.
32157862,It was noted that before the onset of the disease, the patient went to Wuhan on a business trip.
32157862,Despite the given treatment, her body temperature rose to 39.2°C and she was referred to our clinic for further evaluation.
32157862,Then, chest computed tomography was performed and showed bilateral multifocal ground glass opacities with consolidation which suggested viral pneumonia as a differential diagnosis, and the subsequent 2019-novel coronavirus pneumonia nucleic acid test was positive.
32157862,Chest computed tomography offers fast and convenient evaluation of patients with suspected 2019-novel coronavirus pneumonia.
32161940,In December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan and rapidly spread throughout China.
32161940,Demographic and clinical data of all confirmed cases with COVID-19 on admission at Tongji Hospital from January 10 to February 12, 2020, were collected and analyzed.
32161940,The data of laboratory examinations, including peripheral lymphocyte subsets, were analyzed and compared between severe and non-severe patients.
32161940,Of the 452 patients with COVID-19 recruited, 286 were diagnosed as severe infection.
32161940,The median age was 58 years and 235 were male.
32161940,The most common symptoms were fever, shortness of breath, expectoration, fatigue, dry cough and myalgia.
32161940,Severe cases tend to have lower lymphocytes counts, higher leukocytes counts and neutrophil-lymphocyte-ratio (NLR), as well as lower percentages of monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils.
32161940,Most of severe cases demonstrated elevated levels of infection-related biomarkers and inflammatory cytokines.
32161940,The number of T cells significantly decreased, and more hampered in severe cases.
32161940,Both helper T cells and suppressor T cells in patients with COVID-19 were below normal levels, and lower level of helper T cells in severe group.
32161940,The percentage of naïve helper T cells increased and memory helper T cells decreased in severe cases.
32161940,Patients with COVID-19 also have lower level of regulatory T cells, and more obviously damaged in severe cases.
32161940,The novel coronavirus might mainly act on lymphocytes, especially T lymphocytes.
32161940,Surveillance of NLR and lymphocyte subsets is helpful in the early screening of critical illness, diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.
32162081,Infection with COVID-19 is currently rare in children.
32162081,To describe chest CT findings in children with COVID-19.
32162081,We studied children at a large tertiary-care hospital in China, during the period from 28 January 2019 to 8 February 2020, who had positive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for COVID-19.
32162081,We recorded findings at any chest CT performed in the included children, along with core clinical observations.
32162081,We included five children from 10 months to 6 years of age (mean 3.4 years).
32162081,All had had at least one CT scan after admission.
32162081,Three of these five had CT abnormality on the first CT scan (at 2 days, 4 days and 9 days, respectively, after onset of symptoms) in the form of patchy ground-glass opacities; all normalised during treatment.
32162081,Compared to reports in adults, we found similar but more modest lung abnormalities at CT in our small paediatric cohort.
32162456,The recently emerged 2019 Novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and associated COVID-19 disease cause serious or even fatal respiratory tract infection and yet no approved therapeutics or effective treatment is currently available to effectively combat the outbreak.
32162456,This urgent situation is pressing the world to respond with the development of novel vaccine or a small molecule therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2.
32162456,Along these efforts, the structure of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) has been rapidly resolved and made publicly available to facilitate global efforts to develop novel drug candidates.
32162456,Recently, our group has developed a novel deep learning platform - Deep Docking (DD) which provides fast prediction of docking scores of Glide (or any other docking program) and, hence, enables structure-based virtual screening of billions of purchasable molecules in a short time.
32162456,In the current study we applied DD to all 1.3 billion compounds from ZINC15 library to identify top 1,000 potential ligands for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro protein.
32162456,The compounds are made publicly available for further characterization and development by scientific community.
32162699,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has become an important public health issue in the world.
32162699,More than 118 000 cases were confirmed around the world.
32162699,The main clinical manifestations were respiratory symptoms and occasional gastrointestinal symptoms.
32162699,However, there is no unified standard for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.
32162699,In the retrospective analysis, we report nine cases of COVID-19, describe the history of contact, clinical manifestations, the course of diagnosis and clinical treatment before, during and after treatment.
32164424,As of 22 February 2020, more than 77662 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have been documented globally with over 2360 deaths.
32164424,Common presentations of confirmed cases include fever, fatigue, dry cough, upper airway congestion, sputum production, shortness of breath, myalgia/arthralgia with lymphopenia, prolonged prothrombin time, elevated C-reactive protein, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase.
32164424,The reported severe/critical case ratio is approximately 7-10% and median time to intensive care admission is 9.5-10.5 days with mortality of around 1-2% varied geographically.
32164424,Similar to outbreaks of other newly identified virus, there is no proven regimen from conventional medicine and most reports managed the patients with lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, beta-interferon, glucocorticoid and supportive treatment with remdesivir undergoing clinical trial.
32164424,In China, Chinese medicine is proposed as a treatment option by national and provincial guidelines with substantial utilization.
32164424,We reviewed the latest national and provincial clinical guidelines, retrospective cohort studies, and case series regarding the treatment of COVID-19 by add-on Chinese medicine.
32164424,We have also reviewed the clinical evidence generated from SARS and H1N1 management with hypothesized mechanisms and latest <i>in silico</i> findings to identify candidate Chinese medicines for the consideration of possible trials and management.
32164424,Given the paucity of strongly evidence-based regimens, the available data suggest that Chinese medicine could be considered as an adjunctive therapeutic option in the management of COVID-19.
32166607,There is a new public health crises threatening the world with the emergence and spread of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) or the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32166607,The virus originated in bats and was transmitted to humans through yet unknown intermediary animals in Wuhan, Hubei province, China in December 2019.
32166607,There have been around 96,000 reported cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) and 3300 reported deaths to date (05/03/2020).
32166607,The disease is transmitted by inhalation or contact with infected droplets and the incubation period ranges from 2 to 14 d.
32166607,The symptoms are usually fever, cough, sore throat, breathlessness, fatigue, malaise among others.
32166607,The disease is mild in most people; in some (usually the elderly and those with comorbidities), it may progress to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi organ dysfunction.
32166607,Many people are asymptomatic.
32166607,The case fatality rate is estimated to range from 2 to 3%.
32166607,Diagnosis is by demonstration of the virus in respiratory secretions by special molecular tests.
32166607,Common laboratory findings include normal/ low white cell counts with elevated C-reactive protein (CRP).
32166607,The computerized tomographic chest scan is usually abnormal even in those with no symptoms or mild disease.
32166607,Treatment is essentially supportive; role of antiviral agents is yet to be established.
32166607,Prevention entails home isolation of suspected cases and those with mild illnesses and strict infection control measures at hospitals that include contact and droplet precautions.
32166607,The virus spreads faster than its two ancestors the SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), but has lower fatality.
32166607,The global impact of this new epidemic is yet uncertain.
32167153,A new coronavirus, referred to as SARS-CoV-2, is responsible for the recent outbreak of severe respiratory disease.
32167153,This outbreak first detected in Wuhan, China in December 2019, has spread to other regions of China and to 25 other countries as of January, 2020.
32167153,It has been known since the 2003 SARS epidemic that the receptor critical for SARS-CoV entry into host cells is the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
32167153,The S1 domain of the spike protein of SARS-CoV attaches the virus to its cellular receptor ACE2 on the host cells.
32167153,We thought that it is timely to explain the connection between the SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, ACE2 and the rationale for soluble ACE2 as a potential therapy.
32167524,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging infectious disease that was first reported in Wuhan, China, and has subsequently spread worldwide.
32167524,Risk factors for the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 pneumonia have not yet been well delineated.
32167524,To describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or died.
32167524,Retrospective cohort study of 201 patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital in China between December 25, 2019, and January 26, 2020.
32167524,The final date of follow-up was February 13, 2020.
32167524,Confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia.
32167524,The development of ARDS and death.
32167524,Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, management, treatment, and outcome data were also collected and analyzed.
32167524,Of 201 patients, the median age was 51 years (interquartile range, 43-60 years), and 128 (63.7%) patients were men.
32167524,Eighty-four patients (41.8%) developed ARDS, and of those 84 patients, 44 (52.4%) died.
32167524,In those who developed ARDS, compared with those who did not, more patients presented with dyspnea (50 of 84 [59.5%] patients and 30 of 117 [25.6%] patients, respectively [difference, 33.9%; 95% CI, 19.7%-48.1%]) and had comorbidities such as hypertension (23 of 84 [27.4%] patients and 16 of 117 [13.7%] patients, respectively [difference, 13.7%; 95% CI, 1.3%-26.1%]) and diabetes (16 of 84 [19.0%] patients and 6 of 117 [5.1%] patients, respectively [difference, 13.9%; 95% CI, 3.6%-24.2%]).
32167524,In bivariate Cox regression analysis, risk factors associated with the development of ARDS and progression from ARDS to death included older age (hazard ratio [HR], 3.26; 95% CI 2.08-5.11; and HR, 6.17; 95% CI, 3.26-11.67, respectively), neutrophilia (HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.09-1.19; and HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.01-1.17, respectively), and organ and coagulation dysfunction (eg, higher lactate dehydrogenase [HR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.44-1.79; and HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.11-1.52, respectively] and D-dimer [HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01-1.04; and HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01-1.04, respectively]).
32167524,High fever (≥39 °C) was associated with higher likelihood of ARDS development (HR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.11-2.84) and lower likelihood of death (HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.21-0.82).
32167524,Among patients with ARDS, treatment with methylprednisolone decreased the risk of death (HR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.20-0.72).
32167524,Older age was associated with greater risk of development of ARDS and death likely owing to less rigorous immune response.
32167524,Although high fever was associated with the development of ARDS, it was also associated with better outcomes among patients with ARDS.
32167524,Moreover, treatment with methylprednisolone may be beneficial for patients who develop ARDS.
32168162,Novel coronavirus has become a global health hazard and its high infectivity is alarming.
32168162,The imaging findings of the 2019-nCoV infection in our young diabetic patient featured ground-glass opacities and consolidations in both lungs.
32168162,The lung lesions may involute rapidly during the course.
32168162,The patient showed improvement both clinically and on computed tomography imaging at discharged after 2 weeks'treatment.
32168162,Computed tomography scans of patients helped monitor the changes continuously, which could timely provide the information of the evolution of the disease or therapeutic effect to clinicians.
32169119,An acute respiratory disease, caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, previously known as 2019-nCoV), the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread throughout China and received worldwide attention.
32169119,On 30 January 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared the COVID-19 epidemic as a public health emergency of international concern.
32169119,The emergence of SARS-CoV-2, since the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, marked the third introduction of a highly pathogenic and large-scale epidemic coronavirus into the human population in the twenty-first century.
32169119,As of 1 March 2020, a total of 87,137 confirmed cases globally, 79,968 confirmed in China and 7169 outside of China, with 2977 deaths (3.4%) had been reported by WHO.
32169119,Meanwhile, several independent research groups have identified that SARS-CoV-2 belongs to β-coronavirus, with highly identical genome to bat coronavirus, pointing to bat as the natural host.
32169119,The novel coronavirus uses the same receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as that for SARS-CoV, and mainly spreads through the respiratory tract.
32169119,Importantly, increasingly evidence showed sustained human-to-human transmission, along with many exported cases across the globe.
32169119,The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients include fever, cough, fatigue and a small population of patients appeared gastrointestinal infection symptoms.
32169119,The elderly and people with underlying diseases are susceptible to infection and prone to serious outcomes, which may be associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and cytokine storm.
32169119,Currently, there are few specific antiviral strategies, but several potent candidates of antivirals and repurposed drugs are under urgent investigation.
32169119,In this review, we summarized the latest research progress of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical characteristics of COVID-19, and discussed the current treatment and scientific advancements to combat the epidemic novel coronavirus.
32169481,Understanding the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) mode of host cell recognition may help to fight the disease and save lives.
32169481,The spike protein of coronaviruses is the main driving force for host cell recognition.
32169481,In this study, the COVID-19 spike binding site to the cell-surface receptor (Glucose Regulated Protein 78 (GRP78)) is predicted using combined molecular modeling docking and structural bioinformatics.
32169481,The COVID-19 spike protein is modeled using its counterpart, the SARS spike.
32169481,Sequence and structural alignments show that four regions, in addition to its cyclic nature have sequence and physicochemical similarities to the cyclic Pep42.
32169481,Protein-protein docking was performed to test the four regions of the spike that fit tightly in the GRP78 Substrate Binding Domain β (SBDβ).
32169481,The docking pose revealed the involvement of the SBDβ of GRP78 and the receptor-binding domain of the coronavirus spike protein in recognition of the host cell receptor.
32169481,We reveal that the binding is more favorable between regions III (C391-C525) and IV (C480-C488) of the spike protein model and GRP78.
32169481,Region IV is the main driving force for GRP78 binding with the predicted binding affinity of -9.8 kcal/mol.
32169481,These nine residues can be used to develop therapeutics specific against COVID-19.
32170865,In late December 2019, a cluster of unexplained pneumonia cases has been reported in Wuhan, China.
32170865,A few days later, the causative agent of this mysterious pneumonia was identified as a novel coronavirus.
32170865,This causative virus has been temporarily named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and the relevant infected disease has been named as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization, respectively.
32170865,The COVID-19 epidemic is spreading in China and all over the world now.
32170865,The purpose of this review is primarily to review the pathogen, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19, but also to comment briefly on the epidemiology and pathology based on the current evidence.
32171076,Since December, 2019, Wuhan, China, has experienced an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32171076,Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described.
32171076,In this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (≥18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020.
32171076,Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors.
32171076,We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death. 191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital. 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients).
32171076,Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·03-1·17, per year increase; p=0·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5·65, 2·61-12·23; p&lt;0·0001), and d-dimer greater than 1 μg/mL (18·42, 2·64-128·55; p=0·0033) on admission.
32171076,Median duration of viral shedding was 20·0 days (IQR 17·0-24·0) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors.
32171076,The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days.
32171076,The potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 μg/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage.
32171076,Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.

32171740,Recently, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), officially known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in China.
32171740,Despite drastic containment measures, the spread of this virus is ongoing.
32171740,SARS-CoV-2 is the aetiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) characterised by pulmonary infection in humans.
32171740,The efforts of international health authorities have since focused on rapid diagnosis and isolation of patients as well as the search for therapies able to counter the most severe effects of the disease.
32171740,In the absence of a known efficient therapy and because of the situation of a public-health emergency, it made sense to investigate the possible effect of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine against SARS-CoV-2 since this molecule was previously described as a potent inhibitor of most coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-1.
32171740,Preliminary trials of chloroquine repurposing in the treatment of COVID-19 in China have been encouraging, leading to several new trials.
32171740,Here we discuss the possible mechanisms of chloroquine interference with the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle.
32171866,Due to the general susceptibility of new coronaviruses, the clinical characteristics and outcomes of elderly and young patients may be different.
32171866,To analyze the clinical characteristics of elderly patients with 2019 new-type coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19).
32171866,This is a retrospective study of patients with new coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) who were hospitalized in Hainan Provincial People's Hospital from January 15, 2020 to February 18, 2020.
32171866,Compare the clinical characteristics of elderly with Young and Middle-aged patients.
32171866,A total of 56 patients were enrolled 18 elderly patients (32.14%), and 38 young and middle-aged patients (67.86%).
32171866,The most common symptoms in both groups were fever, followed by cough and sputum.
32171866,Four patients in the elderly group received negative pressure ICU for mechanical ventilation, and five patients in the young and middle-aged group.
32171866,One patient died in the elderly group (5.56%), and two patients died in the young and middle-aged group (5.26%).
32171866,The PSI score of the elderly group was higher than that of the young and middle-aged group (P &lt; 0.001).
32171866,The proportion of patients with PSI grades IV and V was significantly higher in the elderly group than in the young and middle-aged group (P &lt; 0.05).
32171866,The proportion of multiple lobe involvement in the elderly group was higher than that in the young and middle-aged group (P &lt; 0.001), and there was no difference in single lobe lesions between the two groups.
32171866,The proportion of lymphocytes in the elderly group was significantly lower than that in the young and middle-aged group (P &lt; 0.001), and the C-reactive protein was significantly higher in the young group (P &lt; 0.001).
32171866,The Lopinavir and Ritonavir Tablets, Chinese medicine, oxygen therapy, and mechanical ventilation were statistically different in the elderly group and the young and middle-aged group, and the P values were all &lt;0.05.
32171866,The mortality of elderly patients with COVID-19 is higher than that of young and middle-aged patients, and the proportion of patients with PSI grade IV and V is significantly higher than that of young and middle-aged patients.
32171866,Elderly patients with COVID-19 are more likely to progress to severe disease.
32171869,Studies on the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have generally been limited to the description of the epidemiology and initial clinical characteristics.
32171869,We investigated the temporal progression in patients with COVID-19.
32171869,In this retrospective, single-center study, we included confirmed cases of COVID-19 from Jan 20 to Feb 6, 2020 in Shanghai.
32171869,Final date of follow-up was February 25, 2020.
32171869,Of the 249 patients enrolled, the median age was 51 years old, and 126 (50.6%) were male.
32171869,The duration from onset of symptoms to hospitalization was 4(2-7) days in symptomatic patients.
32171869,Fever was occurred in 235(94.3%) patients.
32171869,A total of 215 (86.3%) patients had been discharged after 16(12-20) days hospitalization.
32171869,The estimated median duration of fever in all the patients with fever was 10 days (95 confidential intervals [CIs]: 8-11 days) after onset of symptoms.
32171869,Patients who were transferred to intensive care units (ICU) had significantly longer duration of fever as compared to those not in ICU (31 days v.s. 9 days after onset of symptoms, respectively, P &lt;0.0001).
32171869,Radiological aggravation of initial image was observed in 163 (65.7%) patients on day 7 after onset of symptoms.
32171869,154(94.5%) of these patients showed radiological improvement on day 14.
32171869,The median duration to negative reverse-transcriptase PCR tests of upper respiratory tract samples was 11 days (95 CIs: 10-12 days).
32171869,Viral clearance was more likely to be delayed in patients in ICU than those not in ICU (P &lt;0.0001).
32171869,In multivariate logistical analysis, age (Odds ratio [OR] = 1.06) and CD4 T cell count (OR = 0.55 per 100 cells/ul increase) were independently associated with ICU admission.
32171869,The majority of COVID-19 cases are mild.
32171869,The clinical progression pattern suggests that early control of viral replication and application of host-directed therapy in later stage is essential to improve the prognosis of CVOID-19.
32171872,Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China.
32171872,We aimed to compare arbidol and lopinavir/ritonavir(LPV/r) treatment for patients with COVID-19 with LPV/r only.
32171872,In this retrospective cohort study, we included adults (age≥18years) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 without Invasive ventilation, diagnosed between Jan 17, 2020, and Feb 13, 2020.
32171872,Patients, diagnosed after Jan 17, 2020, were given oral arbidol and LPV/r in the combination group and oral LPV/r only in the monotherapy group for 5-21 days.
32171872,The primary endpoint was a negative conversion rate of coronavirus from the date of COVID-19 diagnosis(day7, day14), and assessed whether the pneumonia was progressing or improving by chest CT (day7).
32171872,We analyzed 16 patients who received oral arbidol and LPV/r in the combination group and 17 who oral LPV/r only in the monotherapy group, and both initiated after diagnosis.
32171872,Baseline clinical, laboratory, and chest CT characteristics were similar between groups.
32171872,The SARS-CoV-2 could not be detected for 12(75%) of 16 patients' nasopharyngeal specimens in the combination group after seven days, compared with 6 (35%) of 17 in the monotherapy group (p &lt; 0·05).
32171872,After 14 days, 15 (94%) of 16 and 9 (52·9%) of 17, respectively, SARS-CoV-2 could not be detected (p &lt; 0·05).
32171872,The chest CT scans were improving for 11(69%) of 16 patients in the combination group after seven days, compared with 5(29%) of 17 in the monotherapy group (p &lt; 0·05).
32171872,In patients with COVID-19, the apparent favorable clinical response with arbidol and LPV/r supports further LPV/r only.
32171952,There is a current worldwide outbreak of the novel coronavirus Covid-19 (coronavirus disease 2019; the pathogen called SARS-CoV-2; previously 2019-nCoV), which originated from Wuhan in China and has now spread to 6 continents including 66 countries, as of 24:00 on March 2, 2020.
32171952,Governments are under increased pressure to stop the outbreak spiraling into a global health emergency.
32171952,At this stage, preparedness, transparency, and sharing of information are crucial to risk assessments and beginning outbreak control activities.
32171952,This information should include reports from outbreak site and from laboratories supporting the investigation.
32171952,This paper aggregates and consolidates the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatments and preventions of this new type of coronavirus.
32172226,Background As the number of patients increases, there is a growing understanding of the form of pneumonia sustained by the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which has caused an outbreak in China.
32172226,Up to now, clinical features and treatment of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported in detail.
32172226,However, the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and coagulation has been scarcely addressed.
32172226,Our aim is to investigate the blood coagulation function of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32172226,Methods In our study, 94 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were admitted in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University.
32172226,We prospectively collect blood coagulation data in these patients and in 40 healthy controls during the same period.
32172226,Results Antithrombin values in patients were lower than that in the control group (p &lt; 0.001).
32172226,The values of D-dimer, fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products (FDP), and fibrinogen (FIB) in all SARS-CoV-2 cases were substantially higher than those in healthy controls.
32172226,Moreover, D-dimer and FDP values in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection were higher than those in patients with milder forms.
32172226,Compared with healthy controls, prothrombin time activity (PT-act) was lower in SARS-CoV-2 patients.
32172226,Thrombin time in critical SARS-CoV-2 patients was also shorter than that in controls.
32172226,Conclusions The coagulation function in patients with SARS-CoV-2 is significantly deranged compared with healthy people, but monitoring D-dimer and FDP values may be helpful for the early identification of severe cases.
32172228,A novel zoonotic coronavirus outbreak is spreading all over the world.
32172228,This pandemic disease has now been defined as novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and is sustained by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32172228,As the current gold standard for the etiological diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is (real time) reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) on respiratory tract specimens, the diagnostic accuracy of this technique shall be considered a foremost prerequisite.
32172228,Overall, potential RT-PCR vulnerabilities include general preanalytical issues such as identification problems, inadequate procedures for collection, handling, transport and storage of the swabs, collection of inappropriate or inadequate material (for quality or volume), presence of interfering substances, manual errors, as well as specific aspects such as sample contamination and testing patients receiving antiretroviral therapy.
32172228,Some analytical problems may also contribute to jeopardize the diagnostic accuracy, including testing outside the diagnostic window, active viral recombination, use of inadequately validated assays, insufficient harmonization, instrument malfunctioning, along with other specific technical issues.
32172228,Some practical indications can hence be identified for minimizing the risk of diagnostic errors, encompassing the improvement of diagnostic accuracy by combining clinical evidence with results of chest computed tomography (CT) and RT-PCR, interpretation of RT-PCR results according to epidemiologic, clinical and radiological factors, recollection and testing of upper (or lower) respiratory specimens in patients with negative RT-PCR test results and high suspicion or probability of infection, dissemination of clear instructions for specimen (especially swab) collection, management and storage, together with refinement of molecular target(s) and thorough compliance with analytical procedures, including quality assurance.
32172669,Since December 2019, China has been experiencing an outbreak of a new infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32172669,The clinical features include fever, coughing, shortness of breath, and inflammatory lung infiltration.
32172669,China rapidly listed SARS-CoV-2-related pneumonia as a statutory infectious disease.
32172669,To standardize the diagnosis and treatment of this new infectious disease, an operational recommendation for the diagnosis and management of SARS-CoV-2 infection is developed by Peking Union Medical College Hospital.
32173110,COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) is a public health emergency of international concern.
32173110,As of this time, there is no known effective pharmaceutical treatment, although it is much needed for patient contracting the severe form of the disease.
32173110,The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the evidence regarding chloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19.
32173110,PubMed, EMBASE, and three trial Registries were searched for studies on the use of chloroquine in patients with COVID-19.
32173110,We included six articles (one narrative letter, one in-vitro study, one editorial, expert consensus paper, two national guideline documents) and 23 ongoing clinical trials in China.
32173110,Chloroquine seems to be effective in limiting the replication of SARS-CoV-2 (virus causing COVID-19) in vitro.
32173110,There is rationale, pre-clinical evidence of effectiveness and evidence of safety from long-time clinical use for other indications to justify clinical research on chloroquine in patients with COVID-19.
32173110,However, clinical use should either adhere to the Monitored Emergency Use of Unregistered Interventions (MEURI) framework or be ethically approved as a trial as stated by the World Health Organization.
32173110,Safety data and data from high-quality clinical trials are urgently needed.
32173241,Since the emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (formerly known as the 2019 novel coronavirus [2019-nCoV]) in Wuhan, China in December 2019, which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), more than 75,000 cases have been reported in 32 countries/regions, resulting in more than 2000 deaths worldwide.
32173241,Despite the fact that most COVID-19 cases and mortalities were reported in China, the WHO has declared this outbreak as the sixth public health emergency of international concern.
32173241,The COVID-19 can present as an asymptomatic carrier state, acute respiratory disease, and pneumonia.
32173241,Adults represent the population with the highest infection rate; however, neonates, children, and elderly patients can also be infected by SARS-CoV-2.
32173241,In addition, nosocomial infection of hospitalized patients and healthcare workers, and viral transmission from asymptomatic carriers are possible.
32173241,The most common finding on chest imaging among patients with pneumonia was ground-glass opacity with bilateral involvement.
32173241,Severe cases are more likely to be older patients with underlying comorbidities compared to mild cases.
32173241,Indeed, age and disease severity may be correlated with the outcomes of COVID-19.
32173241,To date, effective treatment is lacking; however, clinical trials investigating the efficacy of several agents, including remdesivir and chloroquine, are underway in China.
32173241,Currently, effective infection control intervention is the only way to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
32173576,To explore the epidemiological information, clinical characteristics, therapeutic outcomes and temporal progression of laboratory findings in 2019-coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients exposed to lopinavir.
32173576,We collected data from ten COVID-19 patients admitted between January 22, 2020 and February 11, 2020 at Xixi hospital in Hangzhou, China.
32173576,Of ten patients, secondary, tertiary and quartus patients emerged, the incubation period was 3-7 days.
32173576,Mainly initial symptoms were cough and low fever (37.3-38.0 ℃).
32173576,An asymptomatic case presented normal radiography, the others existed ground glass opacities.
32173576,All cases (three transferred, seven discharged) exposed to lopinavir on initial hospitalization.
32173576,Three patients stopped lopinavir using because of adverse effect, two of them deteriorated, one hospitalized longer than others who with sustained lopinavir using.
32173576,Levels of potassium, albumin, lymphocyte were low, but increased persistently after treatment.
32173576,Eosinophil values were low on initial hospitalization, then all returned to normal before discharge.
32173576,Viral load of SARS-CoV-2, radiography and eosinophil improved continuously in 3-14, 6-8 and 7-9 days, respectively.
32173576,Increasing eosinophils may be an indicator of COVID-19 improvement.
32173576,The COVID-19 patients may benefit from sustained lopinavir using.
32173576,More researches on a larger scale are needed to verify these points.
32173725,Since December 2019, novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)-infected pneumonia (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, and rapidly spread throughout China.
32173725,This study aimed to clarify the characteristics of patients with refractory COVID-19.
32173725,In this retrospective single-center study, we included 155 consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from January 1st to February 5th.
32173725,The cases were divided into general and refractory COVID-19 groups according to the clinical efficacy after hospitalization, and the difference between groups were compared.
32173725,Compared with general COVID-19 patients (45.2%), refractory patients had an older age, male sex, more underlying comorbidities, lower incidence of fever, higher levels of maximum temperature among fever cases, higher incidence of breath shortness and anorexia, severer disease assessment on admission, high levels of neutrophil, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and C-reactive protein, lower levels of platelets and albumin, and higher incidence of bilateral pneumonia and pleural effusion (P&lt;0.05).
32173725,Refractory COVID-19 patients were more likely to receive oxygen, mechanical ventilation, expectorant, and adjunctive treatment including corticosteroid, antiviral drugs and immune enhancer (P&lt;0.05).
32173725,After adjustment, those with refractory COVID-19 were also more likely to have a male sex and manifestations of anorexia and fever on admission, and receive oxygen, expectorant and adjunctive agents (P&lt;0.05) when considering the factors of disease severity on admission, mechanical ventilation, and ICU transfer.
32173725,Nearly 50% COVID-19 patients could not reach obvious clinical and radiological remission within 10 days after hospitalization.
32173725,The patients with male sex, anorexia and no fever on admission predicted poor efficacy.

32174096,2例患者新型冠状病毒肺炎治愈，1例患者死于新型冠状病毒肺炎。
32174096,<b>结论：</b> 妇科恶性肿瘤患者是感染COVID-19的高危人群，妇科肿瘤医师需根据具体情况做好宣教、防控及治疗等工作。
32174096,在积极防控新型冠状病毒肺炎的同时，有序安全地开展妇科恶性肿瘤患者的诊治。.
32176772,From December 2019 to February 2020, 2019 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a serious outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China.
32176772,Related clinical features are needed.
32176772,We reviewed 69 patients who were hospitalized in Union hospital in Wuhan between January 16 to January 29, 2020.
32176772,All patients were confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the final date of follow-up was February 4, 2020.
32176772,The median age of 69 enrolled patients was 42.0 years (IQR 35.0-62.0), and 32 patients (46%) were men.
32176772,The most common symptoms were fever (60[87%]), cough (38[55%]), and fatigue (29[42%]).
32176772,Most patients received antiviral therapy (66 [98.5%] of 67 patients) and antibiotic therapy (66 [98.5%] of 67 patients).
32176772,As of February 4, 2020, 18 (26.9%) of 67 patients had been discharged, and five patients had died, with a mortality rate of 7.5%.
32176772,According to the lowest SpO2 during admission, cases were divided into the SpO2≥90% group (n=55) and the SpO2&lt;90% group (n=14).
32176772,All 5 deaths occurred in the SpO2&lt;90% group.
32176772,Compared with SpO2≥90% group, patients of the SpO2&lt;90% group were older, and showed more comorbidities and higher plasma levels of IL6, IL10, lactate dehydrogenase, and c reactive protein.
32176772,Arbidol treatment showed tendency to improve the discharging rate and decrease the mortality rate.
32176772,COVID-19 appears to show frequent fever, dry cough, and increase of inflammatory cytokines, and induced a mortality rate of 7.5%.
32176772,Older patients or those with underlying comorbidities are at higher risk of death.
32178593,The recent outbreak of pneumonia-causing COVID-19 in China is an urgent global public health issue with an increase in mortality and morbidity.
32178593,Here we report our modelled homo-trimer structure of COVID-19 spike glycoprotein in both closed (ligand-free) and open (ligand-bound) conformation, which is involved in host cell adhesion.
32178593,We also predict the unique N- and O-linked glycosylation sites of spike glycoprotein that distinguish it from the SARS and underlines shielding and camouflage of COVID-19 from the host the defence system.
32178593,Furthermore, our study also highlights the key finding that the S1 domain of COVID-19 spike glycoprotein potentially interacts with the human CD26, a key immunoregulatory factor for hijacking and virulence.
32178593,These findings accentuate the unique features of COVID-19 and assist in the development of new therapeutics.
32178769,The spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has already taken on pandemic proportions, affecting over 100 countries in a matter of weeks.
32178769,A global response to prepare health systems worldwide is imperative.
32178769,Although containment measures in China have reduced new cases by more than 90%, this reduction is not the case elsewhere, and Italy has been particularly affected.
32178769,There is now grave concern regarding the Italian national health system's capacity to effectively respond to the needs of patients who are infected and require intensive care for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.
32178769,The percentage of patients in intensive care reported daily in Italy between March 1 and March 11, 2020, has consistently been between 9% and 11% of patients who are actively infected.
32178769,The number of patients infected since Feb 21 in Italy closely follows an exponential trend.
32178769,If this trend continues for 1 more week, there will be 30 000 infected patients.
32178769,Intensive care units will then be at maximum capacity; up to 4000 hospital beds will be needed by mid-April, 2020.
32178769,Our analysis might help political leaders and health authorities to allocate enough resources, including personnel, beds, and intensive care facilities, to manage the situation in the next few days and weeks.
32178769,If the Italian outbreak follows a similar trend as in Hubei province, China, the number of newly infected patients could start to decrease within 3-4 days, departing from the exponential trend.
32178769,However, this cannot currently be predicted because of differences between social distancing measures and the capacity to quickly build dedicated facilities in China.
32179150,In December 2019, a novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged from China causing pneumonia outbreaks, first in the Wuhan region of China and then spread worldwide because of its probable high transmission efficiency.
32179150,Owing to the lack of efficient and specific treatments and the need to contain the epidemic, drug repurposing appears to be the best tool to find a therapeutic solution.
32179150,Chloroquine, remdesivir, lopinavir, ribavirin and ritonavir have shown efficacy to inhibit coronavirus in vitro.
32179150,Teicoplanin, an antibiotic used to treat staphylococcal infections, previously showed efficacy to inhibit the first stage of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) viral life cycle in human cells.
32179150,This activity is conserved against SARS-Cov-2, thus placing teicoplanin as a potential treatment for patients with this virus.
32179788,Ginkgolic acids (GA) are alkylphenol constituents of the leaves and fruits of Ginkgo biloba.
32179788,GA has shown pleiotropic effects in vitro, including: antitumor effects through inhibition of lipogenesis; decreased expression of invasion associated proteins through AMPK activation; and potential rescue of amyloid-β (Aβ) induced synaptic impairment.
32179788,GA was also reported to have activity against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus.
32179788,Several mechanisms for this activity have been suggested including: SUMOylation inhibition; blocking formation of the E1-SUMO intermediate; inhibition of fatty acid synthase; non-specific SIRT inhibition; and activation of protein phosphatase type-2C.
32179788,Here we report that GA inhibits Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) by inhibition of both fusion and viral protein synthesis.
32179788,Additionally, we report that GA inhibits human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) genome replication and Zika virus (ZIKV) infection of normal human astrocytes (NHA).
32179788,We show a broad spectrum of fusion inhibition by GA of all three classes of fusion proteins including HIV, Ebola virus (EBOV), influenza A virus (IAV) and Epstein Barr virus (EBV).
32179788,In addition, we show inhibition of a non-enveloped adenovirus.
32179788,Our experiments suggest that GA inhibits virion entry by blocking the initial fusion event.
32179788,Data showing inhibition of HSV-1 and CMV replication, when GA is administered post-infection, suggest a possible secondary mechanism targeting protein and DNA synthesis.
32179788,Thus, in light of the strong effect of GA on viral infection, even after the infection begins, it may potentially be used to treat acute infections (e.g.
32179788,Coronavirus, EBOV, ZIKV, IAV and measles), and also topically for the successful treatment of active lesions (e.g.
32179788,HSV-1, HSV-2 and varicella-zoster virus (VZV)).
32179908,Previous studies on the pneumonia outbreak caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were mainly based on information from adult populations.
32179908,Limited data are available for children with COVID-19, especially for infected infants.
32179908,We report a 55-day-old case with COVID-19 confirmed in China and describe the identification, diagnosis, clinical course, and treatment of the patient, including the disease progression from day 7 to day 11 of illness.
32179908,This case highlights that children with COVID-19 can also present with multiple organ damage and rapid disease changes.
32179908,When managing such patients, frequent and careful clinical monitoring is essential.
32180140,Coronovirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly across the globe.
32180140,People of all ages are susceptible to COVID-19.
32180140,However, literature reports on pediatric patients are limited.
32180140,To improve the recognition of COVID-19 infection in children, we retrospectively reviewed two confirmed pediatric cases from two family clusters.
32180140,Both clinical features and laboratory examination results of the children and their family members were described.
32180140,The two confirmed children only presented with mild respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms.
32180140,Both of them had normal chest CT images.
32180140,After general and symptomatic treatments, both children recovered quickly.
32180140,Both families had travel histories to Hubei Province.
32180140,Pediatric patients with COVID-19 are mostly owing to family cluster or with a close contact history.
32180140,Infected children have relatively milder clinical symptoms than infected adults.
32180140,We should attach importance to early recognition, early diagnosis, and early treatment of infected children.
32180175,To assess the management and safety of epidural or general anesthesia for Cesarean delivery in parturients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and their newborns, and to evaluate the standardized procedures for protecting medical staff.
32180175,We retrospectively reviewed the cases of parturients diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection disease (COVID-19).
32180175,Their epidemiologic history, chest computed tomography scans, laboratory measurements, and SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid positivity were evaluated.
32180175,We also recorded the patients' demographic and clinical characteristics, anesthesia and surgery-related data, maternal and neonatal complications, as well as the health status of the involved medical staff.
32180175,The clinical characteristics of 17 pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 were similar to those previously reported in non-pregnant adult patients.
32180175,All of the 17 patients underwent Cesarean delivery with anesthesia performed according to standardized anesthesia/surgery procedures.
32180175,Fourteen of the patients underwent continuous epidural anesthesia with 12 experiencing significant intraoperative hypotension.
32180175,Three patients received general anesthesia with tracheal intubation because emergency surgery was needed.
32180175,Three of the parturients are still recovering from their Cesarean delivery and are receiving in-hospital treatment for COVID-19.
32180175,Three neonates were born prematurely.
32180175,There were no deaths or serious neonatal asphyxia events.
32180175,All neonatal SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests were negative.
32180175,No medical staff were infected throughout the patient care period.
32180175,Both epidural and general anesthesia were safely used for Cesarean delivery in the parturients with COVID-19.
32180175,Nevertheless, the incidence of hypotension during epidural anesthesia appeared excessive.
32180175,Proper patient transfer, medical staff access procedures, and effective biosafety precautions are important to protect medical staff from COVID-19.
32181903,Since December 2019, novel coronavirus infected pneumonia emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China.
32181903,In severe novel coronavirus pneumonia cases, the number of platelets, their dynamic changes during the treatment, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) were a concern.
32181903,We sought to describe the platelet feature of these cases.
32181903,Single-center case series of the 30 hospitalized patients with confirmed coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 in Huizhou municipal central hospital from January 2020 to February 2020 were retrospectively analyzed.
32181903,Demographic, clinical, blood routine results, other laboratory results, and treatment data were collected and analyzed.
32181903,Outcomes of severe patients and nonsevere patients were compared.
32181903,Univariate analysis showed that: age, platelet peaks, and PLR at peak platelet were the influencing factors in severe patients, multivariate analysis showed that the PLR value at peak platelet during treatment was an independent influencing factor in severe patients.
32181903,The average hospitalization day of patients with platelet peaks during treatment was longer than those without platelet peaks (P &lt; .05).
32181903,The average age of patients with platelet peaks during treatment was older than those without platelet peaks (P &lt; .05).
32181903,The patients with significantly elevated platelets during treatment had longer average hospitalization days.
32181903,And the higher PLR of patients during treatment had longer average hospitalization days.
32181903,Single-center case series of the 30 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Huizhou Municipal Central Hospital, presumed that the number of platelets and their dynamic changes during the treatment may have a suggestion on the severity and prognosis of the disease.
32181903,The patient with markedly elevated platelets and longer average hospitalization days may be related to the cytokine storm.
32181903,The PLR of patients means the degree of cytokine storm, which might provide a new indicator in the monitoring in patients with COVID-19.
32181990,The current outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has raised great concern worldwide, but its impact on transplant recipients is unknown.
32181990,We report here the clinical features and therapeutic course of the first reported renal transplant recipient with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia.
32181990,This is a 52-year-old man who received kidney transplantation 12 years ago.
32181990,His overall clinical characteristics (symptoms, laboratory examinations, and chest CT) were similar to those of non-transplanted COVID-19 patients.
32181990,Following a treatment regimen consisting of reduced immunosuppressant use and low dose methylprednisolone-based therapy, the COVID-19 pneumonia in this long-term immunosuppressive patient was successfully recovered.
32181990,This effectively treated case has reference value for the future treatment of other transplant patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.
32183901,The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China beginning in December 2019.
32183901,As of 31 January 2020, this epidemic had spread to 19 countries with 11 791 confirmed cases, including 213 deaths.
32183901,The World Health Organization has declared it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.
32183901,A scoping review was conducted following the methodological framework suggested by Arksey and O'Malley.
32183901,In this scoping review, 65 research articles published before 31 January 2020 were analyzed and discussed to better understand the epidemiology, causes, clinical diagnosis, prevention and control of this virus.
32183901,The research domains, dates of publication, journal language, authors' affiliations, and methodological characteristics were included in the analysis.
32183901,All the findings and statements in this review regarding the outbreak are based on published information as listed in the references.
32183901,Most of the publications were written using the English language (89.2%).
32183901,The largest proportion of published articles were related to causes (38.5%) and a majority (67.7%) were published by Chinese scholars.
32183901,Research articles initially focused on causes, but over time there was an increase of the articles related to prevention and control.
32183901,Studies thus far have shown that the virus' origination is in connection to a seafood market in Wuhan, but specific animal associations have not been confirmed.
32183901,Reported symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, pneumonia, headache, diarrhea, hemoptysis, and dyspnea.
32183901,Preventive measures such as masks, hand hygiene practices, avoidance of public contact, case detection, contact tracing, and quarantines have been discussed as ways to reduce transmission.
32183901,To date, no specific antiviral treatment has proven effective; hence, infected people primarily rely on symptomatic treatment and supportive care.
32183901,There has been a rapid surge in research in response to the outbreak of COVID-19.
32183901,During this early period, published research primarily explored the epidemiology, causes, clinical manifestation and diagnosis, as well as prevention and control of the novel coronavirus.
32183901,Although these studies are relevant to control the current public emergency, more high-quality research is needed to provide valid and reliable ways to manage this kind of public health emergency in both the short- and long-term.
32185921,Since the end of 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been extensively epidemic in China, which not only seriously threatens the safety and health of Chinese people, but also challenges the management of other infectious diseases.
32185921,Currently, there are still approximately three thousand malaria cases imported into China every year.
32185921,If the diagnosis and treatment of malaria cases as well as the investigation and response of the epidemic foci are not carried out timely, it may endanger patients'lives and cause the possible of secondary transmission, which threatens the achievements of malaria elimination in China.
32185921,Due to the extensive spread and high transmission ability of the COVID-19, there is a possibility of virus infections among malaria cases during the medical care-seeking behaviors and among healthcare professionals during clinical diagnosis and treatment, sample collection and testing and epidemiological surveys.
32185921,This paper analyzes the challenges of the COVID-19 for Chinese malaria elimination programme, and proposes the countermeasures in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, so as to provide the reference for healthcare professionals. <b>［摘要］</b> 2019年底以来, 一种新型冠状病毒病肺炎 (COVID-19) 在我国大范围流行, 不仅严重威胁人民群众的生命安全和身体健康, 同时也给其他传染病防控带来了严峻挑战。
32185921,目前, 我国每年仍有近3 000例境外输入性疟疾病例, 如不能及时开展病例诊治和疫点调查处置, 不仅有可能危及患者生命, 还可能引起继发传播而威胁我国消除疟疾成果。
32185921,新型冠状病毒肺炎流行范围广、传播能力强, 不仅疟疾患者在就医过程中有可能被感染, 而且医务人员在开展临床诊治、样本检测和流行病学调查时也面临感染风险。
32185921,本文分析新型冠状病毒肺炎流行对我国消除疟疾工作的挑战, 并探讨相应的应对策略和措施, 从而为医务工作者提供参考。.
32186172,Severe and critical coronavirus pneumonia 2019 (COVID-19) often occurs in elder patients with multiple comorbidities, and severe hypoxemia events are an important factor in the deterioration of some cases.
32186172,The critical type of COVID-19 could progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ dysfunction, which are the most important causes of death.
32186172,Early start with non-invasive ventilation (NIV) against the possible physiological abnormalities could be helpful to improve prognosis.
32186172,Close monitoring of oxygenation, reducing patients' oxygen consumption, active psychological intervention, and rapidly dealing with severe hypoxemia events are the key factors for the successful treatment of NIV.
32186172,In addition, active adjuvant therapy is also important, such as correcting coagulation dysfunction, providing proper nutritional support, accurate volume control, and safe individualized blood glucose monitoring and control.
32186172,重型和危重型新型冠状病毒肺炎常常发生于高龄及多合并疾病患者，严重低氧事件是造成部分病例病情恶化的重要因素。
32186172,危重型可进展为急性呼吸窘迫综合征及多器官功能障碍，是造成死亡的重要原因。
32186172,针对可能的病生理异常，及早开始无创通气治疗有助于改善预后。
32186172,严密监护氧合情况、降低患者氧耗量、积极心理干预、迅速处理低氧事件是无创通气成功治疗的关键因素。
32186172,积极纠正凝血功能紊乱、合理的营养支持、准确的容量控制和安全个体化的血糖监控等治疗具有重要意义。.
32186277,The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases is showing similar trends in European Union/European Economic Area countries and the United Kingdom confirming that, while at a different stage depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in all countries.
32186277,Based on the experience from Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should increase their preparedness for a surge of patients with COVID-19 who will require healthcare, and in particular intensive care.
32186894,<b>OBJECTIVE.</b> The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical manifestations and CT features of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia in 15 pregnant women and to provide some initial evidence that can be used for guiding treatment of pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia. <b>MATERIALS AND METHODS.</b> We reviewed the clinical data and CT examinations of 15 consecutive pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia in our hospital from January 20, 2020, to February 10, 2020.
32186894,A semiquantitative CT scoring system was used to estimate pulmonary involvement and the time course of changes on chest CT.
32186894,Symptoms and laboratory results were analyzed, treatment experiences were summarized, and clinical outcomes were tracked. <b>RESULTS.</b> Eleven patients had successful delivery (10 cesarean deliveries and one vaginal delivery) during the study period, and four patients were still pregnant (three in the second trimester and one in the third trimester) at the end of the study period.
32186894,No cases of neonatal asphyxia, neonatal death, stillbirth, or abortion were reported.
32186894,The most common early finding on chest CT was ground-glass opacity (GGO).
32186894,With disease progression, crazy paving pattern and consolidations were seen on CT.
32186894,The abnormalities showed absorptive changes at the end of the study period for all patients.
32186894,The most common onset symptoms of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women were fever (13/15 patients) and cough (9/15 patients).
32186894,The most common abnormal laboratory finding was lymphocytopenia (12/15 patients).
32186894,CT images obtained before and after delivery showed no signs of pneumonia aggravation after delivery.
32186894,The four patients who were still pregnant at the end of the study period were not treated with antiviral drugs but had achieved good recovery. <b>CONCLUSION.</b> Pregnancy and childbirth did not aggravate the course of symptoms or CT features of COVID-19 pneumonia.
32186894,All the cases of COVID-19 pneumonia in the pregnant women in our study were the mild type.
32186894,All the women in this study-some of whom did not receive antiviral drugs-achieved good recovery from COVID-19 pneumonia.
32186952,The novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19 or Coronavirus disease 2019) that emerged from Wuhan, Hubei province of China has spread to many countries worldwide.
32186952,Efforts have been made to develop vaccines against human coronavirus (CoV) infections such as MERS and SARS in the past decades.
32186952,However, to date, no licensed antiviral treatment or vaccine exists for MERS and SARS.
32186952,Most of the efforts for developing CoV vaccines and drugs target the spike glycoprotein or S protein, the major inducer of neutralizing antibodies.
32186952,Although a few candidates have shown efficacy in <i>in vitro</i> studies, not many have progressed to randomized animal or human trials, hence may have limited use to counter COVID-19 infection.
32186952,This article highlights ongoing advances in designing vaccines and therapeutics to counter COVID-19 while also focusing on such experiences and advances as made with earlier SARS- and MERS-CoVs, which together could enable efforts to halt this emerging virus infection.
32187464,No therapeutics have yet been proven effective for the treatment of severe illness caused by SARS-CoV-2.
32187464,We conducted a randomized, controlled, open-label trial involving hospitalized adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, which causes the respiratory illness Covid-19, and an oxygen saturation (Sao<sub>2</sub>) of 94% or less while they were breathing ambient air or a ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen (Pao<sub>2</sub>) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio<sub>2</sub>) of less than 300 mm Hg.
32187464,Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either lopinavir-ritonavir (400 mg and 100 mg, respectively) twice a day for 14 days, in addition to standard care, or standard care alone.
32187464,The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement, defined as the time from randomization to either an improvement of two points on a seven-category ordinal scale or discharge from the hospital, whichever came first.
32187464,A total of 199 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent randomization; 99 were assigned to the lopinavir-ritonavir group, and 100 to the standard-care group.
32187464,Treatment with lopinavir-ritonavir was not associated with a difference from standard care in the time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio for clinical improvement, 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90 to 1.72).
32187464,Mortality at 28 days was similar in the lopinavir-ritonavir group and the standard-care group (19.2% vs.
32187464,25.0%; difference, -5.8 percentage points; 95% CI, -17.3 to 5.7).
32187464,The percentages of patients with detectable viral RNA at various time points were similar.
32187464,In a modified intention-to-treat analysis, lopinavir-ritonavir led to a median time to clinical improvement that was shorter by 1 day than that observed with standard care (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.91).
32187464,Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common in the lopinavir-ritonavir group, but serious adverse events were more common in the standard-care group.
32187464,Lopinavir-ritonavir treatment was stopped early in 13 patients (13.8%) because of adverse events.
32187464,In hospitalized adult patients with severe Covid-19, no benefit was observed with lopinavir-ritonavir treatment beyond standard care.
32187464,Future trials in patients with severe illness may help to confirm or exclude the possibility of a treatment benefit.
32187464,(Funded by Major Projects of National Science and Technology on New Drug Creation and Development and others; Chinese Clinical Trial Register number, ChiCTR2000029308.).
32187887,Since December 2019, patients with unexplained pneumonia have been found in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.
32187887,The pathogen in these cases is a new type of coronavirus.
32187887,The World Health Organization confirmed this diagnosis and named the pathogen SARSCoV-2.
32187887,The disease caused by SARSCoV-2 is called Corona Virus Disease (COVID-2019).
32187887,The virus is highly infectious and pathogenic, causing human-to-human transmission.
32187887,At present, SARSCoV-2 is still rampant in the world.
32187887,Zhengzhou City in Henan Province serves as an example, 102 people have been confirmed to be infected with SARSCoV-2 (at 24:00 on February 5th, 2020), including three children, the youngest is 4 years old.
32187887,From the perspective of clinical pediatricians as the first line fighting the epidemic, this paper will discuss the clinical characteristics, prevention and control measures, outcomes, diagnosis, and treatment of pediatric cases.
32189081,The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, which was identified in late 2019, requires special attention because of its future epidemics and possible global threats.
32189081,Beside clinical procedures and treatments, since Artificial Intelligence (AI) promises a new paradigm for healthcare, several different AI tools that are built upon Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are employed for analyzing data and decision-making processes.
32189081,This means that AI-driven tools help identify COVID-19 outbreaks as well as forecast their nature of spread across the globe.
32189081,However, unlike other healthcare issues, for COVID-19, to detect COVID-19, AI-driven tools are expected to have active learning-based cross-population train/test models that employs multitudinal and multimodal data, which is the primary purpose of the paper.
32189175,Knowledge of CT characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia might be helpful to the early diagnosis and treatment of patients, and to control the spread of infection.
32189175,The chest CT images of the patient were collected to describe the CT manifestations and characteristics, and they were compared with the previous studies.
32189175,Multiple patchy ground-glass opacities (GGOs) were seen in bilateral lung, mostly in subpleural areas.
32189175,They progressed within 3 days, and nodular GGOs were also seen together with subpleural patchy GGOs.
32189175,Our case of COVID-19 pneumonia showed multiple subpleural GGOs in bilateral lung, rapid progression, and it also accompanied nodular GGOs on chest CT.
32189175,These findings were consistent with the previous reports, and they might be useful for early detection and evaluation of severity of COVID-19 pneumonia.
32190290,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an ongoing global health emergency.
32190290,Here we highlight nine most important research questions concerning virus transmission, asymptomatic and presymptomatic virus shedding, diagnosis, treatment, vaccine development, origin of virus and viral pathogenesis.
32190904,At present, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rampaging around the world.
32190904,However, asymptomatic carriers intensified the difficulty of prevention and management.
32190904,Here we reported the screening, clinical feathers, and treatment process of a family cluster involving three COVID-19 patients.
32190904,The discovery of the first asymptomatic carrier in this family cluster depends on the repeated and comprehensive epidemiological investigation by disease control experts.
32190904,In addition, the combination of multiple detection methods can help clinicians find asymptomatic carriers as early as possible.
32190904,In conclusion, the prevention and control experience of this family cluster showed that comprehensive rigorous epidemiological investigation and combination of multiple detection methods were of great value for the detection of hidden asymptomatic carriers.

32191691,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first reported in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and has since spread globally, resulting in &gt;95,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases worldwide by March 5, 2020 (1).
32191691,Singapore adopted a multipronged surveillance strategy that included applying the case definition at medical consults, tracing contacts of patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, enhancing surveillance among different patient groups (all patients with pneumonia, hospitalized patients in intensive care units [ICUs] with possible infectious diseases, primary care patients with influenza-like illness, and deaths from possible infectious etiologies), and allowing clinician discretion (i.e., option to order a test based on clinical suspicion, even if the case definition was not met) to identify COVID-19 patients.
32191691,Containment measures, including patient isolation and quarantine, active monitoring of contacts, border controls, and community education and precautions, were performed to minimize disease spread.
32191691,As of March 5, 2020, a total of 117 COVID-19 cases had been identified in Singapore.
32191691,This report analyzes the first 100 COVID-19 patients in Singapore to determine the effectiveness of the surveillance and containment measures.
32191691,COVID-19 patients were classified by the primary means by which they were detected.
32191691,Application of the case definition and contact tracing identified 73 patients, 16 were detected by enhanced surveillance, and 11 were identified by laboratory testing based on providers' clinical discretion.
32191691,Effectiveness of these measures was assessed by calculating the 7-day moving average of the interval from symptom onset to isolation in hospital or quarantine, which indicated significant decreasing trends for both local and imported COVID-19 cases.
32191691,Rapid identification and isolation of cases, quarantine of close contacts, and active monitoring of other contacts have been effective in suppressing expansion of the outbreak and have implications for other countries experiencing outbreaks.
32191830,Over the past three months, the world has faced an unprecedented health hazard.
32191830,The World Health Organization has announced a pandemic infection with an unknown species of coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2.
32191830,Spreading mainly through the droplet route, the virus causes mild symptoms in the majority of cases, the most common being: fever (80%), dry cough (56%), fatigue (22%) and muscle pain (7%); less common symptoms include a sore throat, a runny nose, diarrhea, hemoptysis and chills.
32191830,A life-threatening complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection is an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which occurs more often in older adults, those with immune disorders and co-morbidities.
32191830,Severe forms of the infection, being an indication for treatment in the intensive care unit, comprise acute lung inflammation, ARDS, sepsis and septic shock.
32191830,The article presents basic information about etiology, pathogenesis and diagnostics (with particular emphasis on the importance of tomocomputer imaging), clinical picture, treatment and prevention of the infection.
32191830,It goes on to emphasize the specific risks of providing anesthesiology and intensive care services.
32191830,Due to the fact that effective causal treatment is not yet available and the number of infections and deaths increases day by day, infection prevention and strict adherence to recommendations of infection control organizations remain the basis for fighting the virus.
32192278,To discuss whether the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), World Health Organization (WHO) organized the 15-member International Health Regulations Emergency Committee (EC).
32192278,On January 22-23 and January 30, 2020, EC convened and discussed whether the situation in China and other countries would constitute PHEIC and issued recommendations for WHO, China and the international community.
32192278,Based on the recommendations of EC, WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak a PHEIC.
32192278,One of the purposes of the declaration of PHEIC was to alarm countries with weak public health infrastructures to prepare promptly for emerging infectious diseases (EID) and provide WHO with a framework for proactively supporting those countries.
32192278,On February 3, 2020, WHO proposed the 2019 COVID-19 Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan, which includes accelerating research and development (R&amp;D) processes as one of three major strategies.
32192278,On February 11-12, 2020, WHO held the Global Research and Innovation Forum: Towards a Research Roadmap for COVID-19.
32192278,The fact that a COVID-19 R&amp;D forum was the first meeting convened after the PHEIC declaration testifies to the importance of R&amp;D in response to EID.
32192278,Korea has demonstrated a remarkable capacity in its laboratory response by conducting high-throughput COVID-19 testing and utilizing innovative drive-through samplings.
32192278,These measures for early detection and screening of cases should be followed by full efforts to produce research-based evidence by thoroughly analyzing epidemiological, clinical and immunological data, which will facilitate the development of vaccines and therapeutics for COVID-19.
32192278,It is expected that Korea plays a global partner for COVID-19 research by actively participating in immediate and mid/long-term priorities jointly led by WHO and global partners.
32192294,In December 2019, a new outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 began to occur.
32192294,Its pathogen is 2019-nCoV, which has the characteristics of strong infectivity and general susceptibility.
32192294,The current situation of prevention and control of new coronavirus pneumonia is severe.
32192294,In this context, as front-line medical workers bearing important responsibilities and pressure, while through strict management strategy, we can minimize the risk of infection exposure.
32192294,By summarizing the research progress and guidelines in recent years in the fields of colorectal cancer disease screening, treatment strategies (including early colorectal cancer, locally advanced colorectal cancer, obstructive colorectal cancer, metastatic colorectal cancer and the treatment of patients after neoadjuvant therapy), the choice of medication and time limit for adjuvant therapy, the protective measures for patients undergoing emergency surgery, the re-examination of postoperative patients and the protection of medical staff, etc., authors improve treatment strategies in order to provide more choices for patients to obtain the best treatment under the severe epidemic situation of new coronavirus pneumonia.
32192294,Meanwhile we hope that it can also provide more timely treatment modeling schemes for colleagues.
32192294,2019年12月，新型冠状病毒肺炎开始暴发流行，其病原体为2019-nCoV，具有感染力强，人群普遍易感的特点。
32192294,目前新型冠状病毒肺炎的防控形势严峻。
32192294,在这样的背景下，作为一线的医务工作者肩负着重要的责任和压力，但是通过我们严格的管理策略，可以尽可能地减少感染暴露的风险。
32192294,笔者通过对近几年的研究进展和指南的归纳总结，从结直肠癌的疾病筛查、治疗策略（包括早期结直肠癌、局部晚期结直肠癌、梗阻性结直肠癌、转移性结直肠癌以及新辅助治疗后患者的治疗）、辅助治疗的药物选择和时限选择、急诊手术患者的防护措施、术后患者复查以及医务人员的防护等方面，进行了治疗策略的改进，以期在新型冠状病毒肺炎疫情严峻的形势下，为广大患者提供更多的选择，以获得最佳的治疗，也为各位同道提供更合时宜的治疗模式。.
32192296,Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is currently raging in China.
32192296,It has been proven that COVID-19 can be transmitted from human to human and cause hospital infection, which seriously threatens surgical staffs and inpatients.
32192296,Although colorectal surgery is not a front-line subject in the fight against the epidemic, but in this special situation, it is a difficult task to provide the highest quality medical services and ensure the orderly clinical work, on the premise of maximizing the protection for patients and their families, health of medical staff, and the safety of wards and hospitals, We summarize how to carry out the clinical practice of colorectal surgery under the situation of the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemiology, including the procedures of diagnose and treatment for emergency patients with colorectal tumor, and share the experiences of the diagnosis of colorectal tumor, the management of patients with colorectal cancer who are scheduled to be admitted for surgery, the protection of wards, the perioperative management.
32192296,More importantly, we introduce in detail the operative management and perioperative management of colorectal surgery patients suspected or diagnosed with new coronary pneumonia, including prevention and control measures for medical staff, operating rooms and surgical instruments.
32192296,The main points are as follows: (1) Multidisciplinary team (MDT) must be run through the diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer.
32192296,The members include not only routine departments, but also respiratory department and infectious department.
32192296,(2) Colonoscopy examination may cause cross infection of COVID-19 to patients and doctors.
32192296,Therefore, it is prior to examine the emergency cases and life-threatening patients (bleeding, obstruction, gastrointestinal foreign bodies, etc.).
32192296,If the emergent patients (intestinal obstruction) with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, the surgeons must perform emergency surgery, and intestinal decompressive tube through colonoscopy is not recommended.
32192296,(3) The colorectal cancer patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should be placed in the isolated room with separate medical devices, and the operative room with negative pressure (under -5 Pa) must be separated.
32192296,All disposable medical items, body fluids and feces of the patients in perioperative periods must be unified disposed according to the medical waste standard.
32192296,(4) The surgical medical workers who process colorectal cancer patients with COVID-19 must be protected by three-level.
32192296,After operation, the medical workers must receive medical observation and be isolated for 14 days.
32192296,We hope our &quot;Renji experience&quot; will be beneficial to colleagues.
32192296,新型冠状病毒肺炎（新冠肺炎）目前正在我国肆虐。
32192296,已经证实，新冠肺炎存在明显的院内感染现象，给外科医护人员和住院患者造成严重威胁。
32192296,虽然结直肠外科并不是此次抗击疫情的一线学科，但在特殊的形式下，如何最大限度地在保护患者、家属、医务工作者自身的健康以及病区和医院医疗安全的前提下，为患者提供最优质的医疗服务，保证以往临床工作的有序开展，是当下的艰巨任务。
32192296,笔者参照我国《新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎诊疗方案》，结合《上海仁济医院新型冠状病毒文件汇总》的实际工作情况，总结了新冠肺炎疫情防控形势下，如何开展结直肠外科临床工作，分享了如何在疫情防控情况下，针对结直肠肿瘤急诊患者的诊疗流程、对结直肠肿瘤的诊断和准备择期入院手术结直肠癌患者的处理、病房的防护、围手术期的管理等，更重要的是详细介绍了疑似或确诊新冠肺炎的结直肠外科患者手术及围手术期的管理，包括医务人员及手术室、手术器械的防控措施。
32192296,其中特别强调的包括：（1）多学科诊疗模式(MDT)应贯穿于结直肠肿瘤整个诊疗过程，MDT成员中，除常规相科室外，呼吸科和感染科也需列入。（
32192296,2）肠镜检查有可能导致患者交叉感染，对操作人员和护理人员也存在较大风险，故仅优先对于可能危及生命的急诊患者（出血、梗阻、消化道异物等）进行；若疑似新冠肺炎患者，不采取内镜下减压措施，直接拟定急诊手术治疗方案。（
32192296,3）疑似或确诊新冠肺炎的结直肠外科患者应放置于隔离病室，配备单独医疗器具，在指定的独立负压（-5 Pa以下）手术间完成手术；围手术期伤口换药等使用过所有一次性物品、体液、粪便等，均按医疗废物规范进行处置。（
32192296,4）参加疑似或确诊新冠肺炎的结直肠外科患者手术的医护人员应实施三级防护，术后应隔离进行&quot;医学观察&quot;14 d。
32192296,希望能对同道有所助益。.
32192297,The outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) makes the medical treatment of colorectal cancers difficult.
32192297,Cancer patients are more susceptible to infection and tumor history is defined as an important factor of poor prognosis, which challenges both doctors and patients.
32192297,For metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) patients, maintenance therapy is the optimal choice.
32192297,The patients with tumor progression or poor biological behavior should receive or continue combination chemotherapy.
32192297,Adjuvant chemotherapy should reduce the intensity of treatment and shorten the therapy time.
32192297,Fever patients during chemotherapy need to receive differential diagnosis and screening according to national standards.
32192297,Patients with stable diseases and good general conditions may delay imaging examination.
32192297,Clinicians should make individual clinical decisions based on the specifics of each patient during epidemic situation.
32192297,新型冠状病毒肺炎疫情的爆发给结直肠癌的治疗带来了困难。
32192297,肿瘤患者作为感染的高危人群，肿瘤病史作为新冠肺炎不良预后的重要因素，都是当下医患双方共同面临的挑战。
32192297,对于复发转移性结直肠癌患者，低强度的维持治疗是更好的选择，病情变化或恶性度较高的肿瘤患者仍需接受联合化疗。
32192297,对于根治术后的患者，鉴于辅助化疗获益程度的相对有限，可降低治疗强度并减少治疗时间。
32192297,面对发热的肿瘤化疗患者，需要对患者的发热原因进行分析，按国家《新型冠状病毒感染的肺炎诊疗方案（试行第六版）》文件规定的流程接受排查。
32192297,病情稳定、一般状况良好及治疗有效的患者可择期推迟影像学评估的时间。
32192297,临床医师应根据每例患者的具体情况作出个体化的临床决策。.
32193037,To report CT features of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) in patients with various disease severity.
32193037,The CT manifestations and clinical data of 73 patients with COVID-19 were retrospectively collected in 6 hospitals from Jan 21 to Feb 3, 2020.
32193037,We analyzed the initial and follow-up CT features of patients with disease severity, according to the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia.
32193037,Six patients (8%) were diagnosed as mild type pneumonia; these patients had no obvious abnormal CT findings or manifested mild changes of lung infection.
32193037,All 43 patients (59 %) with common type presented unique or multiple ground-glass opacities (GGO) in the periphery of the lungs, with or without interlobular septal thickening.
32193037,In the 21 patients (29 %) with severe type, extensive GGO and pulmonary consolidation were found in 16 cases (16/21, 76 %) and 5 cases (24 %), respectively.
32193037,An extensive &quot;white lung&quot;, with atelectasis and pleural effusion were found in critical type patients (3, 4%).
32193037,On the resolutive phase of the disease, CT abnormalities showed complete resolution, or demonstrated residual linear opacities.
32193037,Different CT features are seen according to disease severity, which can help COVID-19 stratification.
32193831,An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 was first detected in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
32193831,People of all ages are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32193831,No information on severe pediatric patients with COVID-19 has been reported.
32193831,We aimed to describe the clinical features of severe pediatric patients with COVID-19.
32193831,We included eight severe or critically ill patients with COVID-19 who were treated at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), Wuhan Children's Hospital from January 24 to February 24.
32193831,We collected information including demographic data, symptoms, imaging data, laboratory findings, treatments and clinical outcomes of the patients with severe COVID-19.
32193831,The onset age of the eight patients ranged from 2 months to 15 years; six were boys.
32193831,The most common symptoms were polypnea (8/8), followed by fever (6/8) and cough (6/8).
32193831,Chest imaging showed multiple patch-like shadows in seven patients and ground-glass opacity in six.
32193831,Laboratory findings revealed normal or increased whole blood counts (7/8), increased C-reactive protein, procalcitonin and lactate dehydrogenase (6/8), and abnormal liver function (4/8).
32193831,Other findings included decreased CD16 + CD56 (4/8) and Th/Ts*(1/8), increased CD3 (2/8), CD4 (4/8) and CD8 (1/8), IL-6 (2/8), IL-10 (5/8) and IFN-γ (2/8).
32193831,Treatment modalities were focused on symptomatic and respiratory support.
32193831,Two critically ill patients underwent invasive mechanical ventilation.
32193831,Up to February 24, 2020, three patients remained under treatment in ICU, the other five recovered and were discharged home.
32193831,In this series of severe pediatric patients in Wuhan, polypnea was the most common symptom, followed by fever and cough.
32193831,Common imaging changes included multiple patch-like shadows and ground-glass opacity; and a cytokine storm was found in these patients, which appeared more serious in critically ill patients.
32193905,The large outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that started in Wuhan, China has now spread to many countries worldwide.
32193905,Current epidemiologic knowledge suggests that relatively few cases are seen among children, which limits opportunities to address pediatric specific issues on infection control and the children's contribution to viral spread in the community.
32193905,Here, we report the first pediatric case of COVID-19 in Korea.
32193905,The 10-year-old girl was a close contact of her uncle and her mother who were confirmed to have COVID-19.
32193905,In this report, we present mild clinical course of her pneumonia that did not require antiviral treatment and serial viral test results from multiple specimens.
32193905,Lastly, we raise concerns on the optimal strategy of self-quarantine and patient care in a negative isolation room for children.
32194034,With the novel coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) pandemic spreading quickly in the United States and the world, it is urgent that the rehabilitation community quickly understands the epidemiology of the virus and what we can and must do to face this microbial adversary at the early stages of this likely long global pandemic.
32194034,The 2019-nCoV is a novel virus so most of the world's population does not have prior immunity to it.
32194034,It is more infectious and fatal than seasonal influenza, and definitive treatment and a vaccine are months away.
32194034,Our arsenal against it is currently mainly social distancing and infection control measures.
32194944,We prepared the three-dimensional model of the SARS-CoV-2 (aka 2019-nCoV) 3C-like protease (3CL <sup>pro</sup>) using the crystal structure of the highly similar (96% identity) ortholog from the SARS-CoV.
32194944,All residues involved in the catalysis, substrate binding and dimerisation are 100% conserved.
32194944,Comparison of the polyprotein PP1AB sequences showed 86% identity.
32194944,The 3C-like cleavage sites on the coronaviral polyproteins are highly conserved.
32194944,Based on the near-identical substrate specificities and high sequence identities, we are of the opinion that some of the previous progress of specific inhibitors development for the SARS-CoV enzyme can be conferred on its SARS-CoV-2 counterpart.
32194944,With the 3CL <sup>pro</sup> molecular model, we performed virtual screening for purchasable drugs and proposed 16 candidates for consideration.
32194944,Among these, the antivirals ledipasvir or velpatasvir are particularly attractive as therapeutics to combat the new coronavirus with minimal side effects, commonly fatigue and headache.
32194944,The drugs Epclusa (velpatasvir/sofosbuvir) and Harvoni (ledipasvir/sofosbuvir) could be very effective owing to their dual inhibitory actions on two viral enzymes.
32194995,The outbreak of 2019-novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) that is caused by SARS-CoV-2 has spread rapidly in China, and has developed to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.
32194995,However, no specific antiviral treatments or vaccines are available yet.
32194995,This work aims to share strategies and candidate antigens to develop safe and effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
32195698,Healthcare systems worldwide are responding to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), an emerging infectious syndrome caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus.
32195698,Patients with COVID-19 can progress from asymptomatic or mild illness to hypoxemic respiratory failure or multisystem organ failure, necessitating intubation and intensive care management.
32195698,Healthcare providers, and particularly anesthesiologists, are at the frontline of this epidemic, and they need to be aware of the best available evidence to guide therapeutic management of patients with COVID-19 and to keep themselves safe while doing so.
32195698,Here, the authors review COVID-19 pathogenesis, presentation, diagnosis, and potential therapeutics, with a focus on management of COVID-19-associated respiratory failure.
32195698,The authors draw on literature from other viral epidemics, treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome, and recent publications on COVID-19, as well as guidelines from major health organizations.
32195698,This review provides a comprehensive summary of the evidence currently available to guide management of critically ill patients with COVID-19.
32195704,The coronavirus disease 2019, named COVID-19 officially by the World Health Organization (Geneva, Switzerland) on February 12, 2020, has spread at unprecedented speed.
32195704,After the first outbreak in Wuhan, China, Chinese anesthesiologists encountered increasing numbers of infected patients since December 2019.
32195704,Because the main route of transmission is via respiratory droplets and close contact, anesthesia providers are at a high risk when responding to the devastating mass emergency.
32195704,So far, actions have been taken including but not limited to nationwide actions and online education regarding special procedures of airway management, oxygen therapy, ventilation support, hemodynamic management, sedation, and analgesia.
32195704,As the epidemic situation has lasted for months (thus far), special platforms have also been set up to provide free mental health care to all anesthesia providers participating in acute and critical caring for COVID-19 patients.
32195704,The current article documents the actions taken, lesson learned, and future work needed.
32195705,The COVID-19 outbreak has led to 80,409 diagnosed cases and 3,012 deaths in mainland China based on the data released on March 4, 2020.
32195705,Approximately 3.2% of patients with COVID-19 required intubation and invasive ventilation at some point in the disease course.
32195705,Providing best practices regarding intubation and ventilation for an overwhelming number of patients with COVID-19 amid an enhanced risk of cross-infection is a daunting undertaking.
32195705,The authors presented the experience of caring for the critically ill patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan.
32195705,It is extremely important to follow strict self-protection precautions.
32195705,Timely, but not premature, intubation is crucial to counter a progressively enlarging oxygen debt despite high-flow oxygen therapy and bilevel positive airway pressure ventilation.
32195705,Thorough preparation, satisfactory preoxygenation, modified rapid sequence induction, and rapid intubation using a video laryngoscope are widely used intubation strategies in Wuhan.
32195705,Lung-protective ventilation, prone position ventilation, and adequate sedation and analgesia are essential components of ventilation management.
32196032,Identifying antibodies (Abs) that neutralize infectious agents is the first step for developing therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostic tools for these infectious agents.
32196032,However, current approaches for identifying neutralizing Abs (nAbs) typically rely on dilution-based assays that are costly, inefficient, and only survey a small subset of the entire repertoire.
32196032,There are also intrinsic biases in many steps of conventional nAb identification processes.
32196032,More importantly, conventional assays rely on simple Ab-antigen binding assays, which may not result in identifying the most potent nAbs, as the strongest binder may not be the most potent nAb.
32196032,Droplet microfluidic systems have the capability to overcome such limitations by conducting complex multi-step assays with high reliability, resolution, and throughput in a pico-liter volume water-in-oil emulsion droplet format.
32196032,Here, we describe the development of PRESCIENT (Platform for the Rapid Evaluation of antibody SucCess using Integrated microfluidics ENabled Technology), a droplet microfluidic system that can enable high-throughput single-cell resolution identification of nAb repertoires elicited in response to viral infection.
32196032,We demonstrate PRESCIENT's ability to identify Abs that neutralize a model viral agent, Murine coronavirus (murine hepatitis virus), which causes high mortality rates in experimentally infected mice.
32196032,In-droplet infection of host cells by the virus was first demonstrated, followed by demonstration of in-droplet neutralization by nAbs produced from a single Ab-producing hybridoma cell.
32196032,Finally, fluorescence intensity analyses of two populations of hybridoma cell lines (nAb-producing and non-nAb-producing hybridoma cell lines) successfully discriminated between the two populations.
32196032,The presented strategy and platform have the potential to identify and investigate neutralizing activities against a broad range of potential infectious agents for which nAbs have yet to be discovered, significantly advancing the nAb identification process as well as reinvigorating the field of Ab discovery, characterization, and development.
32196083,A novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2, has swept across 31 provinces in China and over 40 countries worldwide.
32196083,The transition from first symptoms to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is highly likely to be due to uncontrolled cytokine release.
32196083,There is an urgent need to identify safe and effective drugs for treatment.
32196083,Chloroquine (CQ) exhibits a promising inhibitory effect.
32196083,However, the clinical use of CQ can cause severe side effects.
32196083,We propose that hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), which exhibits an antiviral effect highly similar to that of CQ, could serve as a better therapeutic approach.
32196083,HCQ is likely to attenuate the severe progression of COVID-19, inhibiting the cytokine storm by suppressing T cell activation.
32196083,It has a safer clinical profile and is suitable for those who are pregnant.
32196083,It is cheaper and more readily available in China.
32196083,We herein strongly urge that clinical trials are performed to assess the preventive effects of HCQ in both disease infection and progression.
32196410,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with droplets and contact as the main means of transmission.
32196410,Since the first case appeared in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, the outbreak has gradually spread nationwide.
32196410,Up to now, according to official data released by the Chinese health commission, the number of newly diagnosed patients has been declining, and the epidemic is gradually being controlled.
32196410,Although most patients have mild symptoms and good prognosis after infection, some patients developed severe and die from multiple organ complications.
32196410,The pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans remains unclear.
32196410,Immune function is a strong defense against invasive pathogens and there is currently no specific antiviral drug against the virus.
32196410,This article reviews the immunological changes of coronaviruses like SARS, MERS and other viral pneumonia similar to SARS-CoV-2.
32196410,Combined with the published literature, the potential pathogenesis of COVID-19 is inferred, and the treatment recommendations for giving high-doses intravenous immunoglobulin and low-molecular-weight heparin anticoagulant therapy to severe type patients are proposed.
32196707,The outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.
32196707,Since then the novel coronavirus pneumonia disease has been spreading quickly and many countries and territories have been affected, with major outbreaks in China, South Korea, Italy, and Iran.
32196707,Influenza virus has been known as a common pathogen in winter and it can cause pneumonia.
32196707,It was found clinically that very few patients were diagnosed with both COVID-19 and influenza virus.
32196707,A total of 5 of the 115 patients confirmed with COVID-19 were also diagnosed with influenza virus infection, with three cases being influenza A and two cases being influenza B.
32196707,In this study, we describe the clinical characteristics of those patients who got infected with COVID-19 as well as influenza virus.
32196707,Common symptoms at onset of illness included fever (five [100%] patients), cough (five [100%] patients), shortness of breath (five [100%] patients), nasal tampon (three [60%] patients), pharyngalgia (three [60%] patients), myalgia (two [40%] patients), fatigue (two [40%] patients), headache (two [40%] patients), and expectoration (two [40%] patients).
32196707,The laboratory results showed that compared to the normal values, the patients' lymphocytes were reduced (four [80%] patients), and liver functions alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase (two [40%] patients and two [40%] patients) and C-reactive protein (four [80%] patients) were increased when admitted to hospital.
32196707,They stayed in the hospital for 14, 30, 17, 12, and 19 days (28.4 ± 7.02), respectively.
32196707,The main complications for the patients were acute respiratory distress syndrome (one [20%] patients), acute liver injury (three [60%] patients), and diarrhea (two [40%] patients).
32196707,All patients were given antiviral therapy (including oseltamivir), oxygen inhalation, and antibiotics.
32196707,Three patients were treated with glucocorticoids including two treated with oral glucocorticoids.
32196707,One of the five patients had transient hemostatic medication for hemoptysis.
32196707,Fortunately, all patients did not need intensive care unit and were discharged from the hospital without death.
32196707,In conclusion, those patients with both COVID-19 and influenza virus infection did not appear to show a more severe condition because based on the laboratory findings, imaging studies, and patient prognosis, they showed similar clinical characteristics as those patients with COVID-19 infection only.
32196707,However, it is worth noting that the symptoms of nasal tampon and pharyngalgia may be more prone to appear for those coinfection patients.
32197238,The first confirmed case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the United States was reported on January 20, 2020, in Snohomish County, Washington.
32197238,At the epicenter of COVID-19 in the United States, the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, and University of Washington are at the forefront of delivering care to patients with cancer during this public health crisis.
32197238,This Special Feature highlights the unique circumstances and challenges of cancer treatment amidst this global pandemic, and the importance of organizational structure, preparation, agility, and a shared vision for continuing to provide cancer treatment to patients in the face of uncertainty and rapid change.
32197787,In December 2019, the Wuhan Municipal Health and health Commission (Hubei Province, China) reported a series of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology.
32197787,On January 7, 2020, the Chinese authorities identified as a causative agent of the outbreak a new type of virus of the Coronaviridiae family, called SARS-CoV-2.
32197787,Since then, thounsands of cases have been reported with global dissemination.
32197787,Infections in humans cause a broad clinical spectrum ranging from mild upper respiratory tract infection, to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis.
32197787,There is not specific treatment for SARS-CoV-2, which is why the fundamental aspects are to establish adequate prevention measures and support treatment and management of complications.
32198776,The outbreak of the novel coronavirus in China (SARS-CoV-2) that began in December 2019 presents a significant and urgent threat to global health.
32198776,This study was conducted to provide the international community with a deeper understanding of this new infectious disease.
32198776,Epidemiological, clinical features, laboratory findings, radiological characteristics, treatment, and clinical outcomes of 135 patients in northeast Chongqing were collected and analyzed in this study.
32198776,A total of 135 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were enrolled.
32198776,The median age was 47 years (interquartile range, 36-55), and there was no significant gender difference (53.3% men).
32198776,The majority of patients had contact with people from the Wuhan area.
32198776,Forty-three (31.9%) patients had underlying disease, primarily hypertension (13 [9.6%]), diabetes (12 [8.9%]), cardiovascular disease (7 [5.2%]), and malignancy (4 [3.0%]).
32198776,Common symptoms included fever (120 [88.9%]), cough (102 [76.5%]), and fatigue (44 [32.5%]).
32198776,Chest computed tomography scans showed bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs of all the patients.
32198776,All patients received antiviral therapy (135 [100%]) (Kaletra and interferon were both used), antibacterial therapy (59 [43.7%]), and corticosteroids (36 [26.7%]).
32198776,In addition, many patients received traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) (124 [91.8%]).
32198776,It is suggested that patients should receive Kaletra early and should be treated by a combination of Western and Chinese medicines.
32198776,Compared to the mild cases, the severe ones had lower lymphocyte counts and higher plasma levels of Pt, APTT, d-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, PCT, ALB, C-reactive protein, and aspartate aminotransferase.
32198776,This study demonstrates the clinic features and therapies of 135 COVID-19 patients.
32198776,Kaletra and TCM played an important role in the treatment of the viral pneumonia.
32198776,Further studies are required to explore the role of Kaletra and TCM in the treatment of COVID-19.
32201353,The pneumonia caused by novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China in December 2019 is a highly contagious disease.
32201353,The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the ongoing outbreak as a global public health emergency.
32201353,Currently, the research on novel coronavirus is still in the primary stage.
32201353,Based on the current published evidence, we systematically summarizes the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of knowledge surrounding COVID-19.
32201353,This review in the hope of helping the public effectively recognize and deal with the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), and providing a reference for future studies.
32202256,As of February 29, 2020, more than 85,000 cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported from China and 53 other countries with 2,924 deaths.
32202256,On January 30, 2020, the first laboratory-confirmed case of COVID was reported from Kerala, India.
32202256,In view of the earlier evidence about effectiveness of repurposed lopinavir/ritonavir against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (CoV), as well as preliminary docking studies conducted by the ICMR-National Institute of Virology, Pune, the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization approved the restricted public health use of lopinavir/ritonavir combination amongst symptomatic COVID-19 patients detected in the country.
32202256,Hospitalized adult patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection with any one of the following criteria will be eligible to receive lopinavir/ritonavir for 14 days after obtaining written informed consent: (i) respiratory distress with respiratory rate ≥22/min or SpO2 of &lt;94 per cent; (ii) lung parenchymal infiltrates on chest X-ray; (iii) hypotension defined as systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg or need for vasopressor/inotropic medication; (iv) new-onset organ dysfunction; and (v) high-risk groups - age &gt;60 yr, diabetes mellitus, renal failure, chronic lung disease and immunocompromised persons.
32202256,Patients will be monitored to document clinical (hospital length of stay and mortality at 14, 28 and 90 days), laboratory (presence of viral RNA in serial throat swab samples) and safety (adverse events and serious adverse events) outcomes.
32202256,Treatment outcomes amongst initial cases would be useful in providing guidance about the clinical management of patients with COVID-19.
32202256,If found useful in managing initial SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, further evaluation using a randomized control trial design is warranted to guide future therapeutic use of this combination.
32202343,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected hundreds of thousands of people.
32202343,Data on symptoms and prognosis in children are rare.
32202343,A systematic literature review was carried out to identify papers on COVID-19, which is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), using the MEDLINE and Embase databases between January 1 and March 18, 2020.
32202343,The search identified 45 relevant scientific papers and letters.
32202343,The review showed that children have so far accounted for 1%-5% of diagnosed COVID-19 cases, they often have milder disease than adults and deaths have been extremely rare.
32202343,Diagnostic findings have been similar to adults, with fever and respiratory symptoms being prevalent, but fewer children seem to have developed severe pneumonia.
32202343,Elevated inflammatory markers were less common in children, and lymphocytopenia seemed rare.
32202343,Newborn infants have developed symptomatic COVID-19, but evidence of vertical intrauterine transmission was scarce.
32202343,Suggested treatment included providing oxygen, inhalations, nutritional support and maintaining fluids and electrolyte balances.
32202343,The coronavirus disease 2019 has occurred in children, but they seemed to have a milder disease course and better prognosis than adults.
32202343,Deaths were extremely rare.
32202646,Health care workers exposed to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) could be psychologically stressed.
32202646,To assess the magnitude of mental health outcomes and associated factors among health care workers treating patients exposed to COVID-19 in China.
32202646,This cross-sectional, survey-based, region-stratified study collected demographic data and mental health measurements from 1257 health care workers in 34 hospitals from January 29, 2020, to February 3, 2020, in China.
32202646,Health care workers in hospitals equipped with fever clinics or wards for patients with COVID-19 were eligible.
32202646,The degree of symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress was assessed by the Chinese versions of the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, the 7-item Insomnia Severity Index, and the 22-item Impact of Event Scale-Revised, respectively.
32202646,Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with mental health outcomes.
32202646,A total of 1257 of 1830 contacted individuals completed the survey, with a participation rate of 68.7%.
32202646,A total of 813 (64.7%) were aged 26 to 40 years, and 964 (76.7%) were women.
32202646,Of all participants, 764 (60.8%) were nurses, and 493 (39.2%) were physicians; 760 (60.5%) worked in hospitals in Wuhan, and 522 (41.5%) were frontline health care workers.
32202646,A considerable proportion of participants reported symptoms of depression (634 [50.4%]), anxiety (560 [44.6%]), insomnia (427 [34.0%]), and distress (899 [71.5%]).
32202646,Nurses, women, frontline health care workers, and those working in Wuhan, China, reported more severe degrees of all measurements of mental health symptoms than other health care workers (eg, median [IQR] Patient Health Questionnaire scores among physicians vs nurses: 4.0 [1.0-7.0] vs 5.0 [2.0-8.0]; P = .007; median [interquartile range {IQR}] Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale scores among men vs women: 2.0 [0-6.0] vs 4.0 [1.0-7.0]; P &lt; .001; median [IQR] Insomnia Severity Index scores among frontline vs second-line workers: 6.0 [2.0-11.0] vs 4.0 [1.0-8.0]; P &lt; .001; median [IQR] Impact of Event Scale-Revised scores among those in Wuhan vs those in Hubei outside Wuhan and those outside Hubei: 21.0 [8.5-34.5] vs 18.0 [6.0-28.0] in Hubei outside Wuhan and 15.0 [4.0-26.0] outside Hubei; P &lt; .001).
32202646,Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed participants from outside Hubei province were associated with lower risk of experiencing symptoms of distress compared with those in Wuhan (odds ratio [OR], 0.62; 95% CI, 0.43-0.88; P = .008).
32202646,Frontline health care workers engaged in direct diagnosis, treatment, and care of patients with COVID-19 were associated with a higher risk of symptoms of depression (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.11-2.09; P = .01), anxiety (OR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.22-2.02; P &lt; .001), insomnia (OR, 2.97; 95% CI, 1.92-4.60; P &lt; .001), and distress (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.25-2.04; P &lt; .001).
32202646,In this survey of heath care workers in hospitals equipped with fever clinics or wards for patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan and other regions in China, participants reported experiencing psychological burden, especially nurses, women, those in Wuhan, and frontline health care workers directly engaged in the diagnosis, treatment, and care for patients with COVID-19.
32203189,The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has posed a serious threat to global public health, calling for the development of safe and effective prophylactics and therapeutics against infection of its causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), also known as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
32203189,The CoV spike (S) protein plays the most important roles in viral attachment, fusion and entry, and serves as a target for development of antibodies, entry inhibitors and vaccines.
32203189,Here, we identified the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in SARS-CoV-2 S protein and found that the RBD protein bound strongly to human and bat angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors.
32203189,SARS-CoV-2 RBD exhibited significantly higher binding affinity to ACE2 receptor than SARS-CoV RBD and could block the binding and, hence, attachment of SARS-CoV-2 RBD and SARS-CoV RBD to ACE2-expressing cells, thus inhibiting their infection to host cells.
32203189,SARS-CoV RBD-specific antibodies could cross-react with SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein, and SARS-CoV RBD-induced antisera could cross-neutralize SARS-CoV-2, suggesting the potential to develop SARS-CoV RBD-based vaccines for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection.
32203711,WHO interim guidelines recommend offering extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to eligible patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32203711,The number of patients with COVID-19 infection who might develop severe ARDS that is refractory to maximal medical management and require this level of support is currently unknown.
32203711,Available evidence from similar patient populations suggests that carefully selected patients with severe ARDS who do not benefit from conventional treatment might be successfully supported with venovenous ECMO.
32203711,The need for ECMO is relatively low and its use is mostly restricted to specialised centres globally.
32203711,Providing complex therapies such as ECMO during outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases has unique challenges.
32203711,Careful planning, judicious resource allocation, and training of personnel to provide complex therapeutic interventions while adhering to strict infection control measures are all crucial components of an ECMO action plan.
32203711,ECMO can be initiated in specialist centres, or patients can receive ECMO during transportation from a centre that is not specialised for this procedure to an expert ECMO centre.
32203711,Ensuring that systems enable safe and coordinated movement of critically ill patients, staff, and equipment is important to improve ECMO access.
32203711,ECMO preparedness for the COVID-19 pandemic is important in view of the high transmission rate of the virus and respiratory-related mortality.
32204411,COVID-19 (Corona Virus Disease 2019) has significantly resulted in a large number of psychological consequences.
32204411,The aim of this study is to explore the impacts of COVID-19 on people's mental health, to assist policy makers to develop actionable policies, and help clinical practitioners (e.g., social workers, psychiatrists, and psychologists) provide timely services to affected populations.
32204411,We sample and analyze the Weibo posts from 17,865 active Weibo users using the approach of Online Ecological Recognition (OER) based on several machine-learning predictive models.
32204411,We calculated word frequency, scores of emotional indicators (e.g., anxiety, depression, indignation, and Oxford happiness) and cognitive indicators (e.g., social risk judgment and life satisfaction) from the collected data.
32204411,The sentiment analysis and the paired sample t-test were performed to examine the differences in the same group before and after the declaration of COVID-19 on 20 January, 2020.
32204411,The results showed that negative emotions (e.g., anxiety, depression and indignation) and sensitivity to social risks increased, while the scores of positive emotions (e.g., Oxford happiness) and life satisfaction decreased.
32204411,People were concerned more about their health and family, while less about leisure and friends.
32204411,The results contribute to the knowledge gaps of short-term individual changes in psychological conditions after the outbreak.
32204411,It may provide references for policy makers to plan and fight against COVID-19 effectively by improving stability of popular feelings and urgently prepare clinical practitioners to deliver corresponding therapy foundations for the risk groups and affected people.
32204750,With the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and growing knowledge of its diagnosis and treatment, it has been clear that children are also susceptible to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32204750,The children with hematological tumors are a special population with immunosuppression and special therapeutic characteristics.
32204750,Here the management guideline for pediatric wards of hematology and oncology during COVID-19 epidemic is established based on the features of children with hematological tumors.
32204751,The recent ongoing outbreak of severe pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), currently of unknown origin, creates a world emergency that has put global public health institutions on high alert.
32204751,At present there is limited clinical information of the SARS-CoV-2 and there is no specific treatment recommended, although technical guidances and suggestions have been developed and will continue to be updated as additional information becomes available.
32204751,Preventive treatment has an important role to control and avoid the spread of severe respiratory disease, but often is difficult to obtain and sometimes cannot be effective to reduce the risk of deterioration of the underlining lung pathology.
32204751,In order to define an effective and safe treatment for SARS-CoV-2-associated disease, we provide considerations on the actual treatments, on how to avoid complications and the undesirable side effects related to them and to select and apply earlier the most appropriate treatment.
32204751,Approaching to treat severe respiratory disease in infants and children, the risks related to the development of atelectasis starting invasive or non-invasive ventilation support and the risk of oxygen toxicity must be taken into serious consideration.
32204751,For an appropriate and effective approach to treat severe pediatric respiratory diseases, two main different strategies can be proposed according to the stage and severity of the patient conditions: patient in the initial phase and with non-severe lung pathology and patient with severe initial respiratory impairment and/or with delay in arrival to observation.
32204751,The final outcome is strictly connected with the ability to apply an appropriate treatment early and to reduce all the complications that can arise during the intensive care admission.
32204755,Since December 2019, the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
32204755,The infected cases were noted mostly in adults, but rarely reported in children, especially neonates.
32204755,Most children with SARS-CoV-2 infection present mainly with respiratory symptoms, but less commonly with gastrointestinal symptoms, and tend to have mild clinical symptoms.
32204755,A neonate with SARS-CoV-2 infection, who had vomiting and milk refusal as the first symptom, was recently admitted to Wuhan Children's Hospital.
32204755,After two weeks of treatment, the patient recovered gradually and was discharged.
32204755,Here, this case is reported to improve the understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection in neonates.
32204757,This article reports the diagnosis and treatment of twin girls who were diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in Hunan Province, China.
32204757,The twin girls, aged 1 year and 2 months, were admitted on January 29, 2020 due to fever for one day and cough and sneezing for two days respectively.
32204757,Both recovered after symptomatic treatment.
32204757,The two girls had mild symptoms and rapid recovery, suggesting that children with SARS-CoV-2 infection may be mild and have a good prognosis.
32204757,There were differences in the clinical symptoms and imaging findings between the twin girls, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infection has diverse clinical features in children.
32204758,Since December 2019, the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has become the most serious public health issue.
32204758,As the special population with immature immune function, newborns with COVID-19 have been reported.
32204758,Newborns with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should be transferred to designated hospitals for isolation treatment.
32204758,An emergency transfer response plan for newborns with COVID-19 has been worked out.
32204758,This plan puts forward the indications for neonatal COVID-19 transfer, organization management, protection strategies for medical staff, work procedures, and disinfection methods for transfer equipment, in order to provide guidance and suggestions for the inter-hospital transfer of suspected or confirmed neonatal COVID-19.
32205092,COVID-19 emerges as a pandemic disease with high mortality.
32205092,Development of effective prevention and treatment is an urgent need.
32205092,We reviewed TH17 responses in patients with SARS-CoV-2 and proposed an FDA approved JAK2 inhibitor Fedratinib for reducing mortality of patients with TH17 type immune profiles.
32205186,The outbreak of the new coronavirus infections COVID-19 in December 2019 in China has quickly become a global health emergency.
32205186,Given the lack of specific anti-viral therapies, the current management of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2) is mainly supportive, even though several compounds are now under investigation for the treatment of this life-threatening disease.
32205186,COVID-19 pandemic is certainly conditioning the treatment strategy of a complex disorder as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), whose infectious risk is increased compared to the general population because of an overall impairment of immune system typical of autoimmune diseases combined with the iatrogenic effect generated by corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs.
32205186,However, the increasing knowledge about the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection is leading to consider some anti-rheumatic drugs as potential treatment options for the management of COVID-19.
32205186,In this review we will critically analyse the evidences on either positive or negative effect of drugs commonly used to treat RA in this particular scenario, in order to optimize the current approach to RA patients.
32205204,Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have been found to be efficient on SARS-CoV-2, and reported to be efficient in Chinese COV-19 patients.
32205204,We evaluate the role of hydroxychloroquine on respiratory viral loads.
32205204,French Confirmed COVID-19 patients were included in a single arm protocol from early March to March 16<sup>th</sup>, to receive 600mg of hydroxychloroquine daily and their viral load in nasopharyngeal swabs was tested daily in a hospital setting.
32205204,Depending on their clinical presentation, azithromycin was added to the treatment.
32205204,Untreated patients from another center and cases refusing the protocol were included as negative controls.
32205204,Presence and absence of virus at Day6-post inclusion was considered the end point.
32205204,Six patients were asymptomatic, 22 had upper respiratory tract infection symptoms and eight had lower respiratory tract infection symptoms.
32205204,Twenty cases were treated in this study and showed a significant reduction of the viral carriage at D6-post inclusion compared to controls, and much lower average carrying duration than reported of untreated patients in the literature.
32205204,Azithromycin added to hydroxychloroquine was significantly more efficient for virus elimination.
32205204,Despite its small sample size our survey shows that hydroxychloroquine treatment is significantly associated with viral load reduction/disappearance in COVID-19 patients and its effect is reinforced by azithromycin.
32205232,Lianhuaqingwen (LH) as traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula has been used to treat influenza and exerted broad-spectrum antiviral effects on a series of influenza viruses and immune regulatory effects [1].
32205232,The goal of this study is to demonstrate the antiviral activity of LH against the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus and its potential effect in regulating host immune response.
32205232,The antiviral activity of LH against SARS-CoV-2 was assessed in Vero E6 cells using CPE and plaque reduction assay.
32205232,The effect of LH on virion morphology was visualized under transmission electron microscope.
32205232,Pro-inflammatory cytokine expression levels upon SARS-CoV-2 infection in Huh-7 cells were measured by real-time quantitative PCR assays.
32205232,LH significantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells and markedly reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, CCL-2/MCP-1 and CXCL-10/IP-10) production at the mRNA levels.
32205232,Furthermore, LH treatment resulted in abnormal particle morphology of virion in cells.
32205232,LH significantly inhibits the SARS-COV-2 replication, affects virus morphology and exerts anti-inflammatory activity in vitro.
32205232,These findings indicate that LH protects against the virus attack, making its use a novel strategy for controlling the COVID-19 disease.
32205349,The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) lies behind the ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32205349,There is a growing understanding of SARS-CoV-2 in the virology, epidemiology and clinical management strategies.
32205349,However, no anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug or vaccine has been officially approved due to the absence of adequate evidence.
32205349,Scientists are racing towards the development of treatment for COVID-19.
32205349,Recent studies have revealed many attractive threptic options, even if some of them remain to be further confirmed in rigorous preclinical models and clinical trials.
32205349,In this minireview, we aim to summarize the updated potential approaches against SARS-CoV-2.
32205349,We emphasize that further efforts are warranted to develop the safest and most effective approach.
32207032,Since December 2019, COVID-19 has occurred unexpectedly and emerged as a health problem worldwide.
32207032,Despite the rapidly increasing number of cases in subsequent weeks, the clinical characteristics of pediatric cases are rarely described.
32207032,A cross-sectional multicenter study was carried out in 10 hospitals across Hubei province.
32207032,A total of 25 confirmed pediatric cases of COVID-19 were collected.
32207032,The demographic data, epidemiological history, underlying diseases, clinical manifestations, laboratory and radiological data, treatments, and outcomes were analyzed.
32207032,Of 25 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the boy to girl ratio was 1.27:1.
32207032,The median age was 3 years.
32207032,COVID-19 cases in children aged &lt;3 years, 3.6 years, and ≥6-years patients were 10 (40%), 6 (24%), and 9 (36%), respectively.
32207032,The most common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (13 [52%]), and dry cough (11 [44%]).
32207032,Chest CT images showed essential normal in 8 cases (33.3%), unilateral involvement of lungs in 5 cases (20.8%), and bilateral involvement in 11 cases (45.8%).
32207032,Clinical diagnoses included upper respiratory tract infection (n=8), mild pneumonia (n=15), and critical cases (n=2).
32207032,Two critical cases (8%) were given invasive mechanical ventilation, corticosteroids, and immunoglobulin.
32207032,The symptoms in 24 (96%) of 25 patients were alleviated and one patient had been discharged.
32207032,It was concluded that children were susceptible to COVID-19 like adults, while the clinical presentations and outcomes were more favorable in children.
32207032,However, children less than 3 years old accounted for majority cases and critical cases lied in this age group, which demanded extra attentions during home caring and hospitalization treatment.
32207377,Pseudoviruses are useful virological tools because of their safety and versatility, especially for emerging and re-emerging viruses.
32207377,Due to its high pathogenicity and infectivity and the lack of effective vaccines and therapeutics, live SARS-CoV-2 has to be handled under biosafety level 3 conditions, which has hindered the development of vaccines and therapeutics.
32207377,Based on a VSV pseudovirus production system, a pseudovirus-based neutralization assay has been developed for evaluating neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in biosafety level 2 facilities.
32207377,The key parameters for this assay were optimized, including cell types, cell numbers, virus inoculum.
32207377,When tested against the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, SARS-CoV-2 convalescent patient sera showed high neutralizing potency, which underscore its potential as therapeutics.
32207377,The limit of detection for this assay was determined as 22.1 and 43.2 for human and mouse serum samples respectively using a panel of 120 negative samples.
32207377,The cutoff values were set as 30 and 50 for human and mouse serum samples, respectively.
32207377,This assay showed relatively low coefficient of variations with 15.9% and 16.2% for the intra- and inter-assay analyses respectively.
32207377,Taken together, we established a robust pseudovirus-based neutralization assay for SARS-CoV-2 and are glad to share pseudoviruses and related protocols with the developers of vaccines or therapeutics to fight against this lethal virus.
32207591,To analyze the CT findings of patients with different clinical types of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32207591,A total of 67 patients diagnosed as COVID-19 by nucleic acid testing were included and divided into 4 groups according to the clinical staging based on <i>Diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia (Trial version 6)</i>.
32207591,The CT imaging characteristics were analyzed among patients with different clinical types.
32207591,Among 67 patients, 3 (4.5%) were mild cases, 35 (52.2%) were ordinary cases, 22 (32.8%) were severe cases, and 7 (10.4%) were critically ill.
32207591,There were no abnormal CT findings in mild cases.
32207591,In 35 ordinary cases, there were single lesions in 3 cases (8.6%) and multiple lesions in 33 cases (91.4%), while in severe case 1 case had single lesion (4.5%) and 21 had multiple lesions (95.5%).
32207591,CT images of ordinary patients were mainly manifested as solid plaque shadow and halo sign (18/35, 51.4%); while fibrous strip shadow with ground glass shadow was more frequent in severe cases (7/22, 31.8%).
32207591,Consolidation shadow as the main lesion was observed in 7 cases, and all of them were severe or critical ill patients.
32207591,CT images in patients with different clinical types of COVID-19 have characteristic manifestations, and solid shadow may predict severe and critical illness.
32208494,Due to the current development around the COVID-19 pandemic, palliative ch has created a Task Force to provide recommendations for health professionals on the treatment of palliative care patients in the various settings ‒ inpatient and outpatient.
32208840,Three leading infectious disease experts in China were invited to share their bedside observations in the management of COVID-19 patients.
32208840,Professor Taisheng Li was sent to Wuhan to provide frontline medical care.
32208840,He depicts the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32208840,Furthermore, he observes the significant abnormality of coagulation function and proposes that the early intravenous immunoglobulin and low molecular weight heparin anticoagulation therapy are very important.
32208840,Professor Hongzhou Lu, a leader in China to try various anti-viral drugs, expresses concern on the quality of the ongoing clinical trials as most trials are small in scale and repetitive in nature, and emphasizes the importance of the quick publication of clinical trial results.
32208840,Regarding the traditional Chinese medicine, Professor Lu suggests to develop a creative evaluation system because of the complicated chemical compositions.
32208840,Professor Wenhong Zhang is responsible for Shanghai's overall clinical management of the COVID-19 cases.
32208840,He introduces the team approach to manage COVID-19 patients.
32208840,For severe or critically ill patients, in addition to the respiratory supportive treatment, timely multiorgan evaluation and treatment is very crucial.
32208840,The medical decisions and interventions are carefully tailored to the unique characteristics of each patient.
32208987,During the spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2, some reports of data still emerging and in need of full analysis indicate that certain groups of patients are at risk of COVID-19.
32208987,This includes patients with hypertension, heart disease, diabetes mellitus, and clearly the elderly.
32208987,Many of those patients are treated with reninangiotensin system blockers.
32208987,Because the ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) protein is the receptor that facilitates coronavirus entry into cells, the notion has been popularized that treatment with renin-angiotensin system blockers might increase the risk of developing a severe and fatal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection.
32208987,The present article discusses this concept.
32208987,ACE2 in its full-length form is a membrane-bound enzyme, whereas its shorter (soluble) form circulates in blood at very low levels.
32208987,As a mono-carboxypeptidase, ACE2 contributes to the degradation of several substrates including angiotensins I and II.
32208987,ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors do not inhibit ACE2 because ACE and ACE2 are different enzymes.
32208987,Although angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers have been shown to upregulate ACE2 in experimental animals, the evidence is not always consistent and differs among the diverse angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers and differing organs.
32208987,Moreover, there are no data to support the notion that ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker administration facilitates coronavirus entry by increasing ACE2 expression in either animals or humans.
32208987,Indeed, animal data support elevated ACE2 expression as conferring potential protective pulmonary and cardiovascular effects.
32208987,In summary, based on the currently available evidence, treatment with renin-angiotensin system blockers should not be discontinued because of concerns with coronavirus infection.
32209890,The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has caused the outbreak of the acute respiratory disease in Wuhan, Hubei Province of China since December 2019.

32210741,Direct-acting antivirals are effective tools to control viral infections.
32210741,SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus associated with the epidemiological outbreak in late 2019.
32210741,Previous reports showed that HIV-1 protease inhibitors could block SARS-CoV main protease.
32210741,Based on that and using an <i>in silico</i> approach, we evaluated SARS-CoV-2 main protease as a target for HIV-1 protease inhibitors to reveal the structural features related to their antiviral effect.
32210741,Our results showed that several HIV inhibitors such as lopinavir, ritonavir, and saquinavir produce strong interaction with the active site of SARS-CoV-2 main protease.
32210741,Furthermore, broad library protease inhibitors obtained from PubChem and ZINC (www.zinc.docking.org) were evaluated.
32210741,Our analysis revealed 20 compounds that could be clustered into three groups based on their chemical features.
32210741,Then, these structures could serve as leading compounds to develop a series of derivatives optimizing their activity against SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses.
32210741,Altogether, the results presented in this work contribute to gain a deep understanding of the molecular pharmacology of SARS-CoV-2 treatment and validate the use of protease inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2.
32211816,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in considerable morbidity and mortality worldwide since December 2019.
32211816,However, information on cardiac injury in patients affected by COVID-19 is limited.
32211816,To explore the association between cardiac injury and mortality in patients with COVID-19.
32211816,This cohort study was conducted from January 20, 2020, to February 10, 2020, in a single center at Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China; the final date of follow-up was February 15, 2020.
32211816,All consecutive inpatients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were included in this study.
32211816,Clinical laboratory, radiological, and treatment data were collected and analyzed.
32211816,Outcomes of patients with and without cardiac injury were compared.
32211816,The association between cardiac injury and mortality was analyzed.
32211816,A total of 416 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were included in the final analysis; the median age was 64 years (range, 21-95 years), and 211 (50.7%) were female.
32211816,Common symptoms included fever (334 patients [80.3%]), cough (144 [34.6%]), and shortness of breath (117 [28.1%]).
32211816,A total of 82 patients (19.7%) had cardiac injury, and compared with patients without cardiac injury, these patients were older (median [range] age, 74 [34-95] vs 60 [21-90] years; P &lt; .001); had more comorbidities (eg, hypertension in 49 of 82 [59.8%] vs 78 of 334 [23.4%]; P &lt; .001); had higher leukocyte counts (median [interquartile range (IQR)], 9400 [6900-13 800] vs 5500 [4200-7400] cells/μL) and levels of C-reactive protein (median [IQR], 10.2 [6.4-17.0] vs 3.7 [1.0-7.3] mg/dL), procalcitonin (median [IQR], 0.27 [0.10-1.22] vs 0.06 [0.03-0.10] ng/mL), creatinine kinase-myocardial band (median [IQR], 3.2 [1.8-6.2] vs 0.9 [0.6-1.3] ng/mL), myohemoglobin (median [IQR], 128 [68-305] vs 39 [27-65] μg/L), high-sensitivity troponin I (median [IQR], 0.19 [0.08-1.12] vs &lt;0.006 [&lt;0.006-0.009] μg/L), N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (median [IQR], 1689 [698-3327] vs 139 [51-335] pg/mL), aspartate aminotransferase (median [IQR], 40 [27-60] vs 29 [21-40] U/L), and creatinine (median [IQR], 1.15 [0.72-1.92] vs 0.64 [0.54-0.78] mg/dL); and had a higher proportion of multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity in radiographic findings (53 of 82 patients [64.6%] vs 15 of 334 patients [4.5%]).
32211816,Greater proportions of patients with cardiac injury required noninvasive mechanical ventilation (38 of 82 [46.3%] vs 13 of 334 [3.9%]; P &lt; .001) or invasive mechanical ventilation (18 of 82 [22.0%] vs 14 of 334 [4.2%]; P &lt; .001) than those without cardiac injury.
32211816,Complications were more common in patients with cardiac injury than those without cardiac injury and included acute respiratory distress syndrome (48 of 82 [58.5%] vs 49 of 334 [14.7%]; P &lt; .001), acute kidney injury (7 of 82 [8.5%] vs 1 of 334 [0.3%]; P &lt; .001), electrolyte disturbances (13 of 82 [15.9%] vs 17 of 334 [5.1%]; P = .003), hypoproteinemia (11 of 82 [13.4%] vs 16 of 334 [4.8%]; P = .01), and coagulation disorders (6 of 82 [7.3%] vs 6 of 334 [1.8%]; P = .02).
32211816,Patients with cardiac injury had higher mortality than those without cardiac injury (42 of 82 [51.2%] vs 15 of 334 [4.5%]; P &lt; .001).
32211816,In a Cox regression model, patients with vs those without cardiac injury were at a higher risk of death, both during the time from symptom onset (hazard ratio, 4.26 [95% CI, 1.92-9.49]) and from admission to end point (hazard ratio, 3.41 [95% CI, 1.62-7.16]).
32211816,Cardiac injury is a common condition among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, and it is associated with higher risk of in-hospital mortality.
32211844,The outbreak of COVID-19 has become a big threat to China, with high contagious capacity and varied mortality.
32211844,This study aimed to investigate the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of older patients with COVID-19 out of Wuhan.
32211844,A retrospective study was performed, with collecting data from medical records of confirmed COVID-19 patients in Zhejiang province from Jan 17 to Feb 12, 2020.
32211844,Epidemiological, clinical and treatment data were analyzed between those older (≥60y) and younger (&lt;60y) patients.
32211844,Total 788 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were selected, where 136 were older patients with corresponding age of 68.28y±7.314y.
32211844,There was a significantly higher frequency of women in the older patients compared with the younger patients (57.35% vs 46.47%, P=0.021).
32211844,The presence of coexisting medical condition was significantly higher in older patients compared with younger patients (55.15% vs 21.93%, P&lt;0.001), including the rate of hypertension, diabetes, heart diseases and COPD.
32211844,Significantly higher rates of severe (older vs younger groups: 16.18% vs 5.98%, P&lt;0.001)/critical (8.82% vs 0.77%, P&lt;0.001) type, shortness of breath (12.50% vs 3.07%, P&lt;0.001) and high temperature of &gt;39.0℃ (13.97% vs 7.21%, P=0.010) were observed in older patients compared with younger patients.
32211844,Finally, Higher rates of ICU admission (9.56% vs 1.38%, P&lt;0.001) and methylprednisolone application (28.68% vs 9.36%, P&lt;0.001) were also identified in older patients.
32211844,The specific epidemiological and clinical features of older COVID-19 patients included significantly higher female gender, body temperature, co-existing of basic diseases and rate of severe and critical type.
32211963,To systematically analyze CT findings during the early and progressive stages of natural course of coronavirus disease 2019 and also to explore possible changes in pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities during these two stages.
32211963,We retrospectively reviewed the initial chest CT data of 62 confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 patients (34 men, 28 women; age range 20-91 years old) who did not receive any antiviral treatment between January 21 and February 4, 2020, in Chongqing, China.
32211963,Patients were assigned to the early-stage group (onset of symptoms within 4 days) or progressive-stage group (onset of symptoms within 4-7 days) for analysis.
32211963,CT characteristics and the distribution, size, and CT score of pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities were assessed.
32211963,In our study, the major characteristic of coronavirus disease 2019 was ground-glass opacity (61.3%), followed by ground-glass opacity with consolidation (35.5%), rounded opacities (25.8%), a crazy-paving pattern (25.8%), and an air bronchogram (22.6%).
32211963,No patient presented cavitation, a reticular pattern, or bronchial wall thickening.
32211963,The CT scores of the progressive-stage group were significantly greater than those of the early-stage group (p = 0.004).
32211963,Multiple ground-glass opacities with consolidations in the periphery of the lungs were the primary CT characteristic of coronavirus disease 2019.
32211963,CT score can be used to evaluate the severity of the disease.
32211963,If these typical alterations are found, then the differential diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 must be considered.
32211963,• Multiple GGOs with consolidations in the periphery of the lungs were the primary CT characteristic of COVID-19.
32211963,• The halo sign may be a special CT feature in the early-stage COVID-19 patients.
32211963,• Significantly increased CT score may indicate the aggravation of COVID-19 in the progressive stage.
32212378,This commentary seeks to share some key insights relevant to optimizing COVID-19 candidate therapeutics that were learned from attempts to optimize anti-infective posology in settings where quality and timely availability of data is challenging, with particular focus on influenza, including experiences from H5N1 and pH1N1 outbreaks.
32212779,Coronavirus outbreak has affected thousands of people in at least 186 countries which has affected the cancer care delivery system apart from affecting the overall health system.
32212779,Cancer patients are more susceptible to coronavirus infection than individuals without cancer as they are in an immunosuppressive state because of the malignancy and anticancer treatment.
32212779,Oncologists should be more attentive to detect coronavirus infection early, as any type of advanced cancer is at much higher risk for unfavorable outcomes.
32212779,Oncology communities must ensure that cancer patients should spend more time at home and less time out in the community.
32212779,Oncologists and other health care professionals involved in cancer care have a critical opportunity to communicate to their patients to pass on right information regarding practice modifications in view of COVID-19 outbreaks.
32212779,Countries must isolate, test, treat and trace to control the coronavirus pandemic.
32212779,There is a paucity of information on novel coronavirus infection and its impact on cancer patients and cancer care providers.
32212779,To date, there is no scientific guideline regarding management of cancer patients in a background of coronavirus outbreak.&lt;br /&gt;.
32213260,Available animal and cell line models have suggested that specific therapeutics might be effective in treating Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).
32213260,We conducted a systematic review of evidence for treatment with pharmacologic and supportive therapies.
32213260,We developed a protocol and searched 5 databases for studies describing treatment of MERS and deaths in MERS patients.
32213260,Risk of bias (RoB) was assessed by using ROBINS-I tool.
32213260,We retrieved 3,660 unique citations; 20 observational studies met eligibility, and we studied 13 therapies.
32213260,Most studies were at serious or critical RoB; no studies were at low RoB.
32213260,One study, at moderate RoB, showed reduced mortality rates in severe MERS patients with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; no other studies showed a significant lifesaving benefit to any treatment.
32213260,The existing literature on treatments for MERS is observational and at moderate to critical RoB.
32213260,Clinical trials are needed to guide treatment decisions.
32213332,Since the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak began in the Chinese city of Wuhan on Dec 31, 2019, 68 imported cases and 175 locally acquired infections have been reported in Singapore.
32213332,We aimed to investigate options for early intervention in Singapore should local containment (eg, preventing disease spread through contact tracing efforts) be unsuccessful.
32213332,We adapted an influenza epidemic simulation model to estimate the likelihood of human-to-human transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in a simulated Singaporean population.
32213332,Using this model, we estimated the cumulative number of SARS-CoV-2 infections at 80 days, after detection of 100 cases of community transmission, under three infectivity scenarios (basic reproduction number [R<sub>0</sub>] of 1·5, 2·0, or 2·5) and assuming 7·5% of infections are asymptomatic.
32213332,We first ran the model assuming no intervention was in place (baseline scenario), and then assessed the effect of four intervention scenarios compared with a baseline scenario on the size and progression of the outbreak for each R<sub>0</sub> value.
32213332,These scenarios included isolation measures for infected individuals and quarantining of family members (hereafter referred to as quarantine); quarantine plus school closure; quarantine plus workplace distancing; and quarantine, school closure, and workplace distancing (hereafter referred to as the combined intervention).
32213332,We also did sensitivity analyses by altering the asymptomatic fraction of infections (22·7%, 30·0%, 40·0%, and 50·0%) to compare outbreak sizes under the same control measures.
32213332,For the baseline scenario, when R<sub>0</sub> was 1·5, the median cumulative number of infections at day 80 was 279 000 (IQR 245 000-320 000), corresponding to 7·4% (IQR 6·5-8·5) of the resident population of Singapore.
32213332,The median number of infections increased with higher infectivity: 727 000 cases (670 000-776 000) when R<sub>0</sub> was 2·0, corresponding to 19·3% (17·8-20·6) of the Singaporean population, and 1 207 000 cases (1 164 000-1 249 000) when R<sub>0</sub> was 2·5, corresponding to 32% (30·9-33·1) of the Singaporean population.
32213332,Compared with the baseline scenario, the combined intervention was the most effective, reducing the estimated median number of infections by 99·3% (IQR 92·6-99·9) when R<sub>0</sub> was 1·5, by 93·0% (81·5-99·7) when R<sub>0</sub> was 2·0, and by 78·2% (59·0 -94·4) when R<sub>0</sub> was 2·5.
32213332,Assuming increasing asymptomatic fractions up to 50·0%, up to 277 000 infections were estimated to occur at day 80 with the combined intervention relative to 1800 for the baseline at R<sub>0</sub> of 1·5.
32213332,Implementing the combined intervention of quarantining infected individuals and their family members, workplace distancing, and school closure once community transmission has been detected could substantially reduce the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections.
32213332,We therefore recommend immediate deployment of this strategy if local secondary transmission is confirmed within Singapore.
32213332,However, quarantine and workplace distancing should be prioritised over school closure because at this early stage, symptomatic children have higher withdrawal rates from school than do symptomatic adults from work.
32213332,At higher asymptomatic proportions, intervention effectiveness might be substantially reduced requiring the need for effective case management and treatments, and preventive measures such as vaccines.

32213700,The COVID-19 virus is severely testing the Italian healthcare system, as the requests for intensive treatment are greater than the real capacity of the system to receive patients.
32213700,Given this emergency situation, it follows that citizens are limited in their freedom of movement in order to limit infection, and that in hospitals a significant number of critical situations must be faced.
32213700,This brief contribution aims to offer a reflection on the public and clinical role of the bioethicist: a figure able to promote dialogue between the world of medicine and the community, and to face ethical dilemmas even in emergent clinical settings.
32213760,Based on some publications that associate SARS-CoV-2 infection with the use of anti-hypertensive drug groups such as angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (e.g. enalapril) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (e.g. losartan), many patients from South America, Central America or Spain, have stopped or intend to interrupt their treatments with these drugs.
32213760,Hence, it may exist ominous consequences due to this drop out.
32213760,For this reason, it is necessary to quickly warn about this situation and the risks associated with it.
32214286,COVID-19 has affected the United States leading to a national emergency with health care and economic impact, propelling the country into a recession with disrupted lifestyles not seen in recent history.
32214286,COVID-19 is a serious illness leading to multiple deaths in various countries including the United States.
32214286,Several million Americans satisfy the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria for being high risk.
32214286,Unfortunately, the available supply of medical beds and equipment for mechanical ventilation are much less than is projected to be needed.
32214286,The World Health Organization (WHO) and multiple agencies led by the CDC in the United States have attempted to organize intensive outbreak investigation programs utilizing appropriate preventive measures, evaluation, and treatment.
32214286,The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 varies from asymptomatic forms to conditions encompassing multiorgan and systemic manifestations in terms of septic shock, and multiple organ dysfunction (MOD) syndromes.
32214286,The presently approved treatments are supportive but not curative for the disease.
32214286,There are multiple treatments being studied.
32214286,These include vaccines, medications Remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine and potentially combination therapy.
32214286,Finally, expanded umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells or (UC-MSCs) may have a role and are being studied.
32214286,The cure of COVID-19 is essentially dependent on the patients' own immune system.
32214286,When the immune system is over activated in an attempt to kill the virus, this can lead to the production of a large number of inflammatory factors, resulting in severe cytokine storm.
32214286,The cytokine storm may induce organ damage followed by the edema, dysfunction of air exchange, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute cardiac injury, and secondary infection, which may lead to death.
32214286,Thus, at this point, the avoidance of the cytokine storm may be the key for the treatment of HCOV-19 infected patients.In China, where there was limited availability of effective modalities to manage COVID-19 several patients were treated with expanded UC-MSCs.
32214286,Additionally, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care have reported guidelines to treat coronavirus patients with stem cells in the hope of decreasing the number of patients going to the ICU, and, also relatively quickly getting them out of ICU.
32214286,In this manuscript, we describe the urgent need for various solutions, pathogenesis of coronavirus and the clinical evidence for treatment of COVID-19 with stem cells.
32214286,The limited but emerging evidence regarding UC MSC in managing COVID-19 suggests that it might be considered for compassionate use in critically ill patients to reduce morbidity and mortality in the United States.
32214286,The administration and Coronavirus Task Force might wish to approach the potential of expanded UC-MSCs as an evolutionary therapeutic strategy in managing COVID-19 illness with a 3-pronged approach: If proven safe and effective on a specific and limited basis…1.
32214286,Minimize regulatory burden by all agencies so that critically ill COVID-19 patients will have access regardless of their financial circumstance.2.
32214286,Institute appropriate safeguards to avoid negative consequences from unscrupulous actors.3.
32214286,With proper informed consent from patients or proxy when necessary, and subject to accumulation of data in that cohort, allow the procedure to be initiated in critically ill patients who are not responding to conventional therapies.KEY WORDS: Coronavirus, COVID-19, cytokine storm, multiorgan failure, expanded umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells.
32215622,A physiological small animal model that resembles COVID-19 with low mortality is lacking.
32215622,Molecular docking on the binding between angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) of common laboratory mammals and the receptor-binding domain of the surface spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 suggested that the golden Syrian hamster is an option.
32215622,Virus challenge, contact transmission, and passive immunoprophylaxis were performed.
32215622,Serial organ tissues and blood were harvested for histopathology, viral load and titre, chemokine/cytokine assay, and neutralising antibody titre.
32215622,The Syrian hamster could be consistently infected by SARS-CoV-2.
32215622,Maximal clinical signs of rapid breathing, weight loss, histopathological changes from the initial exudative phase of diffuse alveolar damage with extensive apoptosis to the later proliferative phase of tissue repair, airway and intestinal involvement with virus nucleocapsid protein expression, high lung viral load, and spleen and lymphoid atrophy associated with marked cytokine activation were observed within the first week of virus challenge.
32215622,The lung virus titre was between 105-107 TCID50/g.
32215622,Challenged index hamsters consistently infected naïve contact hamsters housed within the same cage, resulting in similar pathology but not weight loss.
32215622,All infected hamsters recovered and developed mean serum neutralising antibody titre ≥1:427 fourteen days post-challenge.
32215622,Immunoprophylaxis with early convalescent serum achieved significant decrease in lung viral load but not in lung pathology.
32215622,No consistent non-synonymous adaptive mutation of the spike was found in viruses isolated from infected hamsters.
32215622,Besides satisfying the Koch's postulates, this readily available hamster model is an important tool for studying transmission, pathogenesis, treatment, and vaccination against SARS-CoV-2.
32216114,Swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) is a novel coronavirus that is involved in severe diarrhea disease in piglets, causing considerable agricultural and economic loss in China.
32216114,The emergence of this new coronavirus increases the importance of understanding SADS-CoV as well as antivirals.
32216114,Coronaviral proteases, including main proteases and papain-like proteases (PLP), are attractive antiviral targets because of their essential roles in polyprotein processing and thus viral maturation.
32216114,Here, we describe the biochemical and structural identification of recombinant SADS papain-like protease 2 (PLP2) domain of nsp3.
32216114,The SADS-CoV PLP2 was shown to cleave nsp1 proteins and also peptides mimicking the nsp2|nsp3 cleavage site and also had deubiquitinating and deISGynating activity by in vitro assays.
32216114,The crystal structure adopts an architecture resembling that of PLPs from other coronaviruses.
32216114,We characterize both conserved and unique structural features likely directing the interaction of PLP2 with the substrates, including the tentative mapping of active site and other essential residues.
32216114,These results provide a foundation for understanding the molecular basis of coronaviral PLPs' catalytic mechanism and for the screening and design of therapeutics to combat infection by SADS coronavirus.
32216248,The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is of hich risk for patients on chronic hemodialysis due to their immunosuppressed state, advanced age, and the coexistence of significant comorbidities, in particular cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and others.
32216248,Additionally, they constitute a closed conglomerate since they come to treatment regularly, spending hours in the treatment places, exposed to a possible acquisition of the infection.
32216248,Finally, going to their treatment regularly prevents them from remaining in home isolation and with potential exposure.
32216248,These recommendations summarize the interventions proposed by three international organizations and add some suggested by national experts, with the aim to early identify the patients and health personnel at risk and reducing the risk of infection.
32216248,La pandemia del SARS-CoV-2 representa un riesgo especial para los pacientes en hemodiálisis crónica por su estado de inmunosupresión, edad avanzada y coexistencia de comorbilidades importantes, en particular patología cardiovascular, diabetes mellitus y otras.
32216248,Adicionalmente, esta población constituye un conglomerado cerrado ya que los pacientes acuden a tratamiento con regularidad y permanecen horas en los lugares de tratamiento, expuestos a una posible adquisición de la infección.
32216248,El hecho de acudir necesaria y regularmente a su tratamiento impide que permanezcan en aislamiento domiciliario y con exposición potencial en el traslado.
32216248,Las presentes recomendaciones resumen las intervenciones propuestas por tres organizaciones internacionales, a las que se agregan algunas sugeridas por expertos nacionales, con el objetivo de identificar precozmente a los pacientes y personal de la salud en riesgo para disminuir el riesgo de infección.
32216653,Outbreaks of infectious etiology, particularly those caused by a novel virus that has no known treatment or vaccine, may result in the interruption of medical care provided to patients with cancer and put them at risk for undertreatment in addition to the risk of being exposed to infection, a life-threatening event among patients with cancer.
32216653,This article describes the approach used to manage patients with cancer during a large-scale Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus hospital outbreak in Saudi Arabia to ensure continuity of care and minimize harm from treatment interruption or acquiring infection.
32216653,The approach taken toward managing this high-risk situation (COVID-19) could be easily adopted by health care organizations and would be helpful to ensure readiness for the occurrence of future outbreaks of different infectious etiologies like those recent episodes of new coronavirus.
32217113,The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, is spreading globally at an accelerated rate, with a basic reproduction number (R0) of 2 - 2.5, indicating that 2 - 3 persons will be infected from an index patient.
32217113,A serious public health emergency, it is particularly deadly in vulnerable populations and communities in which healthcare providers are insufficiently prepared to manage the infection.
32217113,As of March 16, 2020, there are more than 180,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide, with over 7,000 related deaths.
32217113,The SARS-CoV-2 virus has been isolated from asymptomatic individuals, and affected patients continue to be infectious two weeks after cessation of symptoms.
32217113,The substantial morbidity and socioeconomic impact have necessitated drastic measures across all continents, including nationwide lockdowns and border closures.
32217113,Pregnant women and their fetuses represent a high-risk population during infectious disease outbreaks.
32217113,To date, the outcomes of 55 pregnant women infected with COVID-19 and 46 neonates have been reported in the literature, with no definite evidence of vertical transmission.
32217113,Physiological and mechanical changes in pregnancy increase susceptibility to infections in general, particularly when the cardiorespiratory system is affected, and encourage rapid progression to respiratory failure in the gravida.
32217113,Furthermore, the pregnancy bias towards T-helper 2 (Th2) system dominance which protects the fetus, leaves the mother vulnerable to viral infections, which are more effectively contained by the Th1 system.
32217113,These unique challenges mandate an integrated approach to pregnancies affected by SARS-CoV-2.
32217113,Here we present a review of COVID-19 in pregnancy, bringing together the various factors integral to the understanding of pathophysiology and susceptibility, diagnostic challenges with real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays, therapeutic controversies, intrauterine transmission and maternal-fetal complications.
32217113,We discuss the latest options in antiviral therapy and vaccine development, including the novel use of chloroquine in the management of COVID-19.
32217113,Fetal surveillance, in view of the predisposition to growth restriction and special considerations during labor and delivery are addressed.
32217113,Additionally, we focus on keeping frontline obstetric care providers safe while continuing to provide essential services.
32217113,Our clinical service model is built around the principles of workplace segregation, responsible social distancing, containment of cross-infection to healthcare providers, judicious use of personal protective equipment and telemedicine.
32217113,Our aim is to share a framework which can be adopted by tertiary maternity units managing pregnant women in the flux of a pandemic while maintaining the safety of the patient and healthcare provider at its core.
32217834,The pandemic coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is rapidly spreading across the globe.
32217834,In this issue of the JCI, Chen and colleagues compared the clinical and immunological characteristics between moderate and severe COVID-19.
32217834,The authors found that respiratory distress on admission is associated with unfavorable outcomes.
32217834,Increased cytokine levels (IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α), lymphopenia (in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells), and decreased IFN-γ expression in CD4+ T cells are associated with severe COVID-19.
32217834,Overall, this study characterized the cytokine storm in severe COVID-19 and provides insights into immune therapeutics and vaccine design.
32218301,Respiratory RNA viruses are responsible for recurrent acute respiratory illnesses that still represent a major medical need.
32218301,Previously we developed a large variety of benzimidazole derivatives able to inhibit these viruses.
32218301,Herein, two series of (thio)semicarbazone- and hydrazone-based benzimidazoles have been explored, by derivatizing 5-acetyl benzimidazoles previously reported by us, thereby evaluating the influence of the modification on the antiviral activity.
32218301,Compounds <b>6</b>, <b>8</b>, <b>16</b> and <b>17</b>, bearing the 5-(thio)semicarbazone and 5-hydrazone functionalities in combination with the 2-benzyl ring on the benzimidazole core structure, acted as dual inhibitors of influenza A virus and human coronavirus.
32218301,For respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), activity is limited to the 5-thiosemicarbazone (<b>25</b>) and 5-hydrazone (<b>22</b>) compounds carrying the 2-[(benzotriazol-1/2-yl)methyl]benzimidazole scaffold.
32218301,These molecules proved to be the most effective antiviral agents, able to reach the potency profile of the licensed drug ribavirin.
32218301,The molecular docking analysis explained the SAR of these compounds around their binding mode to the target RSV F protein, revealing the key contacts for further assessment.
32218301,The herein-investigated benzimidazole-based derivatives may represent valuable hit compounds, deserving subsequent structural improvements towards more efficient antiviral agents for the treatment of pathologies caused by these human respiratory viruses.
32218340,The emergence of the novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China, which causes severe respiratory tract infections in humans (COVID-19), has become a global health concern.
32218340,Most coronaviruses infect animals but can evolve into strains that cross the species barrier and infect humans.
32218340,At the present, there is no single specific vaccine or efficient antiviral therapy against COVID-19.
32218340,Recently, we showed that intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) treatment reduces inflammation of intestinal epithelial cells and eliminates overgrowth of the opportunistic human fungal pathogen <i>Candida albicans</i> in the murine gut.
32218340,Immunotherapy with IVIg could be employed to neutralize COVID-19.
32218340,However, the efficacy of IVIg would be better if the immune IgG antibodies were collected from patients who have recovered from COVID-19 in the same city, or the surrounding area, in order to increase the chance of neutralizing the virus.
32218340,These immune IgG antibodies will be specific against COVID-19 by boosting the immune response in newly infected patients.
32218340,Different procedures may be used to remove or inactivate any possible pathogens from the plasma of recovered coronavirus patient derived immune IgG, including solvent/detergent, 60 °C heat-treatment, and nanofiltration.
32218340,Overall, immunotherapy with immune IgG antibodies combined with antiviral drugs may be an alternative treatment against COVID-19 until stronger options such as vaccines are available.
32219356,Increasing numbers of confirmed cases and mortality rates of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are occurring in several countries and continents.
32219356,Information regarding the impact of cardiovascular complication on fatal outcome is scarce.
32219356,To evaluate the association of underlying cardiovascular disease (CVD) and myocardial injury with fatal outcomes in patients with COVID-19.
32219356,This retrospective single-center case series analyzed patients with COVID-19 at the Seventh Hospital of Wuhan City, China, from January 23, 2020, to February 23, 2020.
32219356,Analysis began February 25, 2020.
32219356,Demographic data, laboratory findings, comorbidities, and treatments were collected and analyzed in patients with and without elevation of troponin T (TnT) levels.
32219356,Among 187 patients with confirmed COVID-19, 144 patients (77%) were discharged and 43 patients (23%) died.
32219356,The mean (SD) age was 58.50 (14.66) years.
32219356,Overall, 66 (35.3%) had underlying CVD including hypertension, coronary heart disease, and cardiomyopathy, and 52 (27.8%) exhibited myocardial injury as indicated by elevated TnT levels.
32219356,The mortality during hospitalization was 7.62% (8 of 105) for patients without underlying CVD and normal TnT levels, 13.33% (4 of 30) for those with underlying CVD and normal TnT levels, 37.50% (6 of 16) for those without underlying CVD but elevated TnT levels, and 69.44% (25 of 36) for those with underlying CVD and elevated TnTs.
32219356,Patients with underlying CVD were more likely to exhibit elevation of TnT levels compared with the patients without CVD (36 [54.5%] vs 16 [13.2%]).
32219356,Plasma TnT levels demonstrated a high and significantly positive linear correlation with plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels (β = 0.530, P &lt; .001) and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels (β = 0.613, P &lt; .001).
32219356,Plasma TnT and NT-proBNP levels during hospitalization (median [interquartile range (IQR)], 0.307 [0.094-0.600]; 1902.00 [728.35-8100.00]) and impending death (median [IQR], 0.141 [0.058-0.860]; 5375 [1179.50-25695.25]) increased significantly compared with admission values (median [IQR], 0.0355 [0.015-0.102]; 796.90 [401.93-1742.25]) in patients who died (P = .001; P &lt; .001), while no significant dynamic changes of TnT (median [IQR], 0.010 [0.007-0.019]; 0.013 [0.007-0.022]; 0.011 [0.007-0.016]) and NT-proBNP (median [IQR], 352.20 [174.70-636.70]; 433.80 [155.80-1272.60]; 145.40 [63.4-526.50]) was observed in survivors (P = .96; P = .16).
32219356,During hospitalization, patients with elevated TnT levels had more frequent malignant arrhythmias, and the use of glucocorticoid therapy (37 [71.2%] vs 69 [51.1%]) and mechanical ventilation (41 [59.6%] vs 14 [10.4%]) were higher compared with patients with normal TnT levels.
32219356,The mortality rates of patients with and without use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers was 36.8% (7 of 19) and 25.6% (43 of 168).
32219356,Myocardial injury is significantly associated with fatal outcome of COVID-19, while the prognosis of patients with underlying CVD but without myocardial injury is relatively favorable.
32219356,Myocardial injury is associated with cardiac dysfunction and arrhythmias.
32219356,Inflammation may be a potential mechanism for myocardial injury.
32219356,Aggressive treatment may be considered for patients at high risk of myocardial injury.
32219357,Virus infection has been widely described as one of the most common causes of myocarditis.
32219357,However, less is known about the cardiac involvement as a complication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.
32219357,To describe the presentation of acute myocardial inflammation in a patient with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who recovered from the influenzalike syndrome and developed fatigue and signs and symptoms of heart failure a week after upper respiratory tract symptoms.
32219357,This case report describes an otherwise healthy 53-year-old woman who tested positive for COVID-19 and was admitted to the cardiac care unit in March 2020 for acute myopericarditis with systolic dysfunction, confirmed on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, the week after onset of fever and dry cough due to COVID-19.
32219357,The patient did not show any respiratory involvement during the clinical course.
32219357,Cardiac involvement with COVID-19.
32219357,Detection of cardiac involvement with an increase in levels of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and high-sensitivity troponin T, echocardiography changes, and diffuse biventricular myocardial edema and late gadolinium enhancement on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging.
32219357,An otherwise healthy 53-year-old white woman presented to the emergency department with severe fatigue.
32219357,She described fever and dry cough the week before.
32219357,She was afebrile but hypotensive; electrocardiography showed diffuse ST elevation, and elevated high-sensitivity troponin T and NT-proBNP levels were detected.
32219357,Findings on chest radiography were normal.
32219357,There was no evidence of obstructive coronary disease on coronary angiography.
32219357,Based on the COVID-19 outbreak, a nasopharyngeal swab was performed, with a positive result for SARS-CoV-2 on real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay.
32219357,Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed increased wall thickness with diffuse biventricular hypokinesis, especially in the apical segments, and severe left ventricular dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction of 35%).
32219357,Short tau inversion recovery and T2-mapping sequences showed marked biventricular myocardial interstitial edema, and there was also diffuse late gadolinium enhancement involving the entire biventricular wall.
32219357,There was a circumferential pericardial effusion that was most notable around the right cardiac chambers.
32219357,These findings were all consistent with acute myopericarditis.
32219357,She was treated with dobutamine, antiviral drugs (lopinavir/ritonavir), steroids, chloroquine, and medical treatment for heart failure, with progressive clinical and instrumental stabilization.
32219357,This case highlights cardiac involvement as a complication associated with COVID-19, even without symptoms and signs of interstitial pneumonia.
32219428,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic with no specific therapeutic agents and substantial mortality.
32219428,It is critical to find new treatments.
32219428,To determine whether convalescent plasma transfusion may be beneficial in the treatment of critically ill patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.
32219428,Case series of 5 critically ill patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) who met the following criteria: severe pneumonia with rapid progression and continuously high viral load despite antiviral treatment; Pao2/Fio2 &lt;300; and mechanical ventilation.
32219428,All 5 were treated with convalescent plasma transfusion.
32219428,The study was conducted at the infectious disease department, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital in Shenzhen, China, from January 20, 2020, to March 25, 2020; final date of follow-up was March 25, 2020.
32219428,Clinical outcomes were compared before and after convalescent plasma transfusion.
32219428,Patients received transfusion with convalescent plasma with a SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody (IgG) binding titer greater than 1:1000 (end point dilution titer, by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]) and a neutralization titer greater than 40 (end point dilution titer) that had been obtained from 5 patients who recovered from COVID-19.
32219428,Convalescent plasma was administered between 10 and 22 days after admission.
32219428,Changes of body temperature, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (range 0-24, with higher scores indicating more severe illness), Pao2/Fio2, viral load, serum antibody titer, routine blood biochemical index, ARDS, and ventilatory and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) supports before and after convalescent plasma transfusion.
32219428,All 5 patients (age range, 36-65 years; 2 women) were receiving mechanical ventilation at the time of treatment and all had received antiviral agents and methylprednisolone.
32219428,Following plasma transfusion, body temperature normalized within 3 days in 4 of 5 patients, the SOFA score decreased, and Pao2/Fio2 increased within 12 days (range, 172-276 before and 284-366 after).
32219428,Viral loads also decreased and became negative within 12 days after the transfusion, and SARS-CoV-2-specific ELISA and neutralizing antibody titers increased following the transfusion (range, 40-60 before and 80-320 on day 7).
32219428,ARDS resolved in 4 patients at 12 days after transfusion, and 3 patients were weaned from mechanical ventilation within 2 weeks of treatment.
32219428,Of the 5 patients, 3 have been discharged from the hospital (length of stay: 53, 51, and 55 days), and 2 are in stable condition at 37 days after transfusion.
32219428,In this preliminary uncontrolled case series of 5 critically ill patients with COVID-19 and ARDS, administration of convalescent plasma containing neutralizing antibody was followed by improvement in their clinical status.
32219428,The limited sample size and study design preclude a definitive statement about the potential effectiveness of this treatment, and these observations require evaluation in clinical trials.
32219625,Since December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has posed significant threats to the public health and life in China.
32219625,Unlike the other 6 identified coronaviruses, the SARS-Cov-2 has a high infectious rate, a long incubation period and a variety of manifestations.
32219625,In the absence of effective treatments for the virus, it becomes extremely urgent to develop scientific and standardized proposals for prevention and control of virus transmission.
32219625,Hereby we focused on the surgical practice in Neurosurgery Department, Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, and drafted several recommendations based on the latest relevant guidelines and our experience.
32219625,These recommendations have helped us until now to achieve 'zero infection' of doctors and nurses in our department, we would like to share them with other medical staff of neurosurgery to fight 2019-nCoV infection.
32219626,Based on the New Diagnosis and Treatment Scheme for Novel Coronavirus Infected Pneumonia (Trial Edition 5), combined with our current clinical treatment experience, we recently proposed a revision of the first edition of &quot;Guidance for maternal and fetal management during pneumonia epidemics of novel coronavirus infection in the Wuhan Tongji Hospital&quot;.
32219626,This article focused on the issues of greatest concern of pregnant women including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection diagnostic criteria, inspection precautions, drug treatment options, indications and methods of termination of pregnancy, postpartum fever, breastfeeding considerations, mode of mother-to-child transmission, neonatal isolation and advice on neonatal nursing, to provide valuable experience for better management of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant women and newborns.
32219627,During the outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) in Wuhan, public hospitals have played an important role in intensive care, case guidance and scheme optimization.
32219627,At the same time, it also faces unprecedented challenges and tests.
32219627,Based on the treatment of severe patients in Wuhan, combined with the treatment practice in Tongji Hospital affiliated to Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, this paper puts forward the urgency of further strengthening the construction of public hospitals, discusses the feasible path for promoting the development of public hospitals, so as to meet the growing medical needs of the people, improve the ability to respond to major public health emergencies, and effectively guarantee the safety of people's lives and the promotion of a healthy China construction.
32219814,Since December 2019, a series of highly infectious cases of unexplained pneumonia have been discovered in Wuhan, Hubei Province, which have been confirmed as '2019 corona virus disease' caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32219814,SARS-CoV-2 virus can invade many human systems including the lungs.
32219814,Patients with central nervous system involvement may show a series of neurological symptoms, which is easy to be misdiagnosed and neglected, thereby increasing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
32219814,Hereditary ataxia is a large group of neurodegenerative diseases with great clinical and genetic heterogeneity and high mortality and disability.
32219814,In view of the seriousness of the COVID-19 epidemic, a series of prevention and control measures adopted by the government have restricted the follow-up, diagnosis and treatment of patients by the hospitals, which has a great impact on their mental and physical health.
32219814,In order to standardize the management of patients during the prevention and control of COVID-19 epidemic, the Specialized Committee of Neurogenetics of the Neurophysician Branch of Chinese Medical Doctor Association has formulated this consensus, with an aim to help patients to overcome the difficulties and pass the epidemic prevention period safely.
32219882,An outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 infection has posed significant threats to international health and the economy.
32219882,In the absence of specific treatment for this virus, there is an urgent need to learn from the experience and lessons in China.
32219882,To reduce the case-fatality rate among coronavirus disease 2019 patients, we should not ignore the complications, such as RNAaemia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and multiple organ dysfunction.
32219882,To help understand the advantages and limitations of differential treatments, we provide a timely review and discuss the complications and corresponding major treatments, especially controversial ones such as antiviral therapy (remdesivir, ribavirin, and chloroquine), glucocorticoid therapy, extracorporeal support including an artificial liver system, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation based on available evidence.
32219882,As a result, we suggest that antiviral therapy and organ function support are vital to reduce mortality for mild patients and critical patients, respectively.
32219885,In this study, we collected a total of 610 hospitalized patients from Wuhan between February 2, 2020, and February 17, 2020.
32219885,We reported a potentially high false negative rate of real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2 in the 610 hospitalized patients clinically diagnosed with COVID-19 during the 2019 outbreak.
32219885,We also found that the RT-PCR results from several tests at different points were variable from the same patients during the course of diagnosis and treatment of these patients.
32219885,Our results indicate that in addition to the emphasis on RT-PCR testing, clinical indicators such as computed tomography images should also be used not only for diagnosis and treatment but also for isolation, recovery/discharge, and transferring for hospitalized patients clinically diagnosed with COVID-19 during the current epidemic.
32219885,These results suggested the urgent needs for the standard of procedures of sampling from different anatomic sites, sample transportation, optimization of RT-PCR, serology diagnosis/screening for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and distinct diagnosis from other respiratory diseases such as fluenza infections as well.
32219995,Since December 2019, a new coronavirus (COVID-19) infection has rapidly become prevalent in central China<sup>1</sup> .
32219995,On the basis of knowledge obtained from a previous coronavirus outbreak<sup>2</sup> , pregnant women are believed to be susceptible to this virus.
32219995,Once a maternal infection of COVID-19 is suspected or confirmed, childbirth becomes complicated and challenging.
32219995,Efficient obstetric treatment is required, and is key to optimizing the prognosis for both mother and child.
32219995,Care should be taken in determination of the timing of delivery, assessment of the indications for caesarean section, preparation of the delivery room to prevent infection, choice of the type of anesthesia, and newborn management.
32220033,At present, the severity of patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been a focal point.
32220033,To assess the factors associated with severity and prognosis of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, we retrospectively investigated the clinical, imaging, and laboratory characteristics of confirmed 280 cases of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) from January 20 to February 20, 2020.
32220033,The median age of patients in the mild group was 37.55 years old, while that in the severe group was 63.04 years old.
32220033,The proportion of patients over 65 years old in the severe group was significantly higher than that of the mild group (59.04% vs.
32220033,10.15%, P &lt; 0.05).
32220033,85.54% of severe patients had diabetes or cardiovascular diseases, which was significantly higher than that of the mild group (51.81% vs 7.11%, P = 0.025; 33.73% vs 3.05%, P = 0.042).
32220033,Patients in the mild group experienced earlier initiation of antiviral treatment (1.19 ± 0.45 vs 2.65 ± 1.06 days in the severe group, P &lt; 0.001).
32220033,Our study showed that comorbidity, time from illness onset to antiviral, and age &gt;=65 were three major risk factors for COVID-19 progression, while comorbidity and time from illness onset to antiviral were two major risk factors for COVID-19 recovery.
32220033,The elderly and patients with underlying diseases are more likely to experience a severe progression of COVID-19.
32220033,It is recommended that timely antiviral treatment should be initiated to slow the disease progression and improve the prognosis.
32220112,A relatively high mortality of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is worrying, the application of heparin in COVID-19 has been recommended by some expert consensus due to the risk of disseminated intravascular coagulation and venous thromboembolism.
32220112,However, its efficacy remains to be validated.
32220112,Coagulation results, medications and outcomes of consecutive patients being classified as severe COVID-19 in Tongji hospital were retrospectively analysed.
32220112,The 28-day mortality between heparin users and nonusers were compared, also in different risk of coagulopaphy which was stratified by the sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) score or D-dimer result.
32220112,There were 449 patients with severe COVID-19 enrolled into the study, 99 of them received heparin (mainly with low molecular weight heparin, LMWH) for 7 days or longer.
32220112,The D-dimer, prothrombin time and age were positively, and platelet count was negatively, correlated with 28-day mortality in multivariate analysis.
32220112,No difference on 28-day mortality was found between heparin users and nonusers (30.3% vs 29.7%, P=0.910).
32220112,But the 28-day mortality of heparin users were lower than nonusers In patients with SIC score ≥4 (40.0% vs 64.2%, P=0.029), or D-dimer &gt; 6 fold of upper limit of normal (32.8% vs 52.4%, P=0.017).
32220112,Anticoagulant therapy mainly with LMWH appears to be associated with better prognosis in severe COVID-19 patients meeting SIC criteria or with markedly elevated D-dimer.
32220177,This review summarizes the ongoing researches regarding etiology, epidemiology, transmission dynamics, treatment, and prevention and control strategies of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with comparison to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and pandemic H1N1 virus.
32220177,SARS-CoV-2 may be originated from bats, and the patients and asymptomatic carriers are the source of epidemic infection.
32220177,The virus can be transmitted human-to-human through droplets and close contact, and people at all ages are susceptible to this virus.
32220177,The main clinical symptoms of the patients are fever and cough, accompanied with leukocytopenia and lymphocytopenia.
32220177,Effective drugs have been not yet available thus far.
32220177,In terms of the prevention and control strategies, vaccine development as the primary prevention should be accelerated.
32220177,Regarding the secondary prevention, ongoing efforts of the infected patients and close contacts quarantine, mask wearing promotion, regular disinfection in public places should be continued.
32220177,Meanwhile, rapid detection kit for serological monitoring of the virus in general population is expected so as to achieve early detection, early diagnosis, early isolation and early treatment.
32220177,In addition, public health education on this disease and prevention should be enhanced so as to mitigate panic and mobilize the public to jointly combat the epidemic.
32220178,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel coronavirus, also known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2), has become a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.
32220178,Due to the large infection population, broad transmissibility and high mortality, it is urgent to find out the efficient and specific methods to prevent and treat COVID-19.
32220178,As biological products have broadly applied in the prevention and treatment of severe epidemic diseases, they are promising in blocking novel coronavirus infection.
32220178,According to the research advances of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), we reviewed the potential application of biological products such as interferon, convalescent plasma, intestinal micro-ecological regulators, vaccines and therapeutic antibodies, etc. , on prevention and treatment of COVID-19.
32220178,May this review be helpful for conquering COVID-19 in the near future.
32220179,Based on the higher mortality and the higher proportion of critically ill adults in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with diabetes, good inpatient glycemic control is particularly important in the comprehensive treatment of COVID-19.
32220179,Individualized blood glucose target goals and treatment strategies should be made according to specific circumstances of COVID-19 inpatients with diabetes.
32220179,For mild patients, a strict glycemic control target (fasting plasma glucose (FPG) 4.4-6.1 mmol/L, 2-hour postprandial plasma glucose (2 h PG) 6.1-7.8 mmol/L) are recommended; a target for the glycemic control of common type patients (FPG 6.1-7.8 mmol/L, 2 h PG 7.8-10.0 mmol/L) and subcutaneous insulin deliver therapy are recommended; a target nonfasting blood glucose range of 10.0 mmol or less per liter for severe-type COVID-19 patients, a relatively Less stringent blood glucose control target (FPG 7.8-10.0 mmol/L, 2 h PG 7.8-13.9 mmol/L) for critically ill patients and intravenous insulin infusion therapy are recommended.
32220179,Due to the rapid changes in the condition of some patients, the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar status (HHS) maybe occur during the treatment.
32220179,Blood glucose monitoring, dynamic evaluation and timely adjustment of strategies should be strengthened to ensure patient safety and promote early recovery of patients.
32220276,<b>Objective:</b> To investigate the clinical and coagulation characteristics of the critical Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with acro-ischemia in the intensive care unit (ICU). <b>Methods:</b> The retrospective study included 7 critical COVID-19 patients with acro-ischemia in a single center in Wuhan, from Feb 4 to Feb 15, 2020.

32220284,In December, 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China.
32220284,The number of affected pregnant women is increasing, but scarce information is available about the clinical features of COVID-19 in pregnancy.
32220284,This study aimed to clarify the clinical features and obstetric and neonatal outcomes of pregnant patients with COVID-19.
32220284,In this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all pregnant women with COVID-19 who were admitted to Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China.
32220284,Clinical features, treatments, and maternal and fetal outcomes were assessed.
32220284,Seven patients, admitted to Tongji Hospital from Jan 1, to Feb 8, 2020, were included in our study.
32220284,The mean age of the patients was 32 years (range 29-34 years) and the mean gestational age was 39 weeks plus 1 day (range 37 weeks to 41 weeks plus 2 days).
32220284,Clinical manifestations were fever (six [86%] patients), cough (one [14%] patient), shortness of breath (one [14%] patient), and diarrhoea (one [14%] patient).
32220284,All the patients had caesarean section within 3 days of clinical presentation with an average gestational age of 39 weeks plus 2 days.
32220284,The final date of follow-up was Feb 12, 2020.
32220284,The outcomes of the pregnant women and neonates were good.
32220284,Three neonates were tested for SARS-CoV-2 and one neonate was infected with SARS-CoV-2 36 h after birth.
32220284,The maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes of patients who were infected in late pregnancy appeared very good, and these outcomes were achieved with intensive, active management that might be the best practice in the absence of more robust data.
32220284,The clinical characteristics of these patients with COVID-19 during pregnancy were similar to those of non-pregnant adults with COVID-19 that have been reported in the literature.

32221523,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a public health emergency.
32221523,The widely used reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) method has limitations for clinical diagnosis and treatment.
32221523,A total of 323 samples from 76 COVID-19 confirmed patients were analyzed by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) and RT-PCR based two target genes (ORF1ab and N).
32221523,Nasal swabs, throat swabs, sputum, blood, and urine were collected.
32221523,Clinical and imaging data were obtained for clinical staging.
32221523,In 95 samples tested positive by both methods, the cycle threshold (Ct) of RT-PCR was highly correlated with the copy numbed of ddPCR (ORF1ab gene, R2 = 0.83; N gene, R2 = 0.87). 4 (4/161) negative and 41 (41/67) single-gene positive samples tested by RT-PCR were positive according to ddPCR with viral load ranging from 11.1 to 123.2 copies/test.
32221523,Then the viral load of respiratory samples was compared and the average viral load in sputum (17429 ± 6920 copies/test) was found to be significantly higher than in throat swabs (2552 ± 1965 copies/test, p &lt; 0.001) and nasal swabs (651 ± 501 copies/test, p &lt; 0.001).
32221523,Furthermore, the viral load in the early and progressive stages were significantly higher than that in the recovery stage (46800 ± 17272 vs 1252 ± 1027, p &lt; 0.001) analyzed by sputum samples.
32221523,Quantitative monitoring of viral load in lower respiratory tract samples helps to evaluate disease progression, especially in cases of low viral load.
32221973,Novel coronavirus 2019 is a single-stranded, ribonucleic acid virus that has led to an international pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019.
32221973,Clinical data from the Chinese outbreak have been reported, but experiences and recommendations from clinical practice during the Italian outbreak have not.
32221973,We report the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak on regional and national healthcare infrastructure.
32221973,We also report on recommendations based on clinical experiences of managing patients throughout Italy.
32221973,In particular, we describe key elements of clinical management, including: safe oxygen therapy; airway management; personal protective equipment; and non-technical aspects of caring for patients diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019.
32221973,Only through planning, training and team working will clinicians and healthcare systems be best placed to deal with the many complex implications of this new pandemic.
32221983,This article reviews the correlation between angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and severe risk factors for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the possible mechanisms.
32221983,ACE2 is a crucial component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS).
32221983,The classical RAS ACE-Ang II-AT1R regulatory axis and the ACE2-Ang 1-7-MasR counter-regulatory axis play an essential role in maintaining homeostasis in humans.
32221983,ACE2 is widely distributed in the heart, kidneys, lungs, and testes.
32221983,ACE2 antagonizes the activation of the classical RAS system and protects against organ damage, protecting against hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.
32221983,Similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 also uses the ACE2 receptor to invade human alveolar epithelial cells.
32221983,Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a clinical high-mortality disease, and ACE2 has a protective effect on this type of acute lung injury.
32221983,Current research shows that the poor prognosis of patients with COVID-19 is related to factors such as sex (male), age (&gt;60 years), underlying diseases (hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease), secondary ARDS, and other relevant factors.
32221983,Because of these protective effects of ACE2 on chronic underlying diseases and ARDS, the development of spike protein-based vaccine and drugs enhancing ACE2 activity may become one of the most promising approaches for the treatment of COVID-19 in the future.
32222119,The aim is to evaluate pregnant women infected with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and provide help for clinical prevention and treatment.
32222119,All five cases of pregnant women confirmed COVID-19 were collected among patients who admitted to the Maternal and Child Hospital of Hubei Province between January 20 and February 10, 2020.
32222119,All patients, aging from 25 to 31 years old, had the gestational week from 38th weeks to 41st weeks.
32222119,All pregnant women did not have an antepartum fever but developed a low-grade fever (37.5℃-38.5℃) within 24 hours after delivery.
32222119,All patients had normal liver and renal function, two patients had elevated plasma levels of the myocardial enzyme.
32222119,Unusual chest imaging manifestations, featured with ground-grass opacity, were frequently observed in bilateral (three cases) or unilateral lobe (two cases) by computed tomography (CT) scan.
32222119,All labors smoothly processed, the Apgar scores were 10 points 1 and 5 minutes after delivery, no complications were observed in the newborn.
32222119,Pregnancy and perinatal outcomes of patients with COVID-19 should receive more attention.
32222119,It is probable that pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19 have no fever before delivery.
32222119,Their primary initial manifestations were merely low-grade postpartum fever or mild respiratory symptoms.
32222119,Therefore, the protective measures are necessary on admission; the instant CT scan and real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction assay should be helpful in early diagnosis and avoid cross-infection on the occasion that patients have fever and other respiratory signs.
32222121,To explore the feasibility of surgical treatment for cancer patients complicated with corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32222121,The management and clinical outcome of a sigmoid cancer patient with COVID-19 were analyzed.
32222121,The inflammation indicators and fever of this patient were effectively controlled and the lung lesions remained stable after active anti-viral treatment, then the radical colorectomy was performed after the viral negative conversion for twice.
32222121,The case indicates that it may feasible to undergo radical tumor surgery for cancer patients with COVID-19 after the virus nucleic acid testing turns negative and more studies are needed to confirm this conclusion.
32222433,Recommendations for the management of patients with gynecological cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic period.
32222433,Recommendations based on the consensus conference model.
32222433,In the case of a COVID-19 positive patient, surgical management should be postponed for at least 15 days.
32222433,For cervical cancer, the place of surgery must be re-evaluated in relation to radiotherapy and Radio-Chemotherapy-Concomitant and the value of lymph node staging surgeries must be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.
32222433,For advanced ovarian cancers, neo-adjuvant chemotherapy should be favored even if primary cytoreduction surgery could be envisaged.
32222433,It is lawful not to offer hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy during a COVID-19 pandemic.
32222433,In the case of patients who must undergo interval surgery, it is possible to continue the chemotherapy and to offer surgery after 6 cycles of chemotherapy.
32222433,For early stage endometrial cancer, in case of low and intermediate preoperative ESMO risk, hysterectomy with bilateral annexectomy associated with a sentinel lymph node procedure should be favored.
32222433,It is possible to consider postponing surgery for 1 to 2 months in low-risk endometrial cancers (FIGO Ia stage on MRI and grade 1-2 endometrioid cancer on endometrial biopsy).
32222433,For high ESMO risk, it ispossible to favor the MSKCC algorithm (combining PET-CT and sentinel lymph node biopsy) in order to omit pelvic and lumbar-aortic lymphadenectomies.
32222433,During COVID-19 pandemic, patients suffering from cancer should not lose life chance, while limiting the risks associated with the virus.
32222463,A new human coronavirus (HCoV), which has been designated SARS-CoV-2, began spreading in December 2019 in Wuhan City, China causing pneumonia called COVID-19.
32222463,The spread of SARS-CoV-2 has been faster than any other coronaviruses that have succeeded in crossing the animal-human barrier.
32222463,There is concern that this new virus will spread around the world as did the previous two HCoVs-Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-each of which caused approximately 800 deaths in the years 2002 and 2012, respectively.
32222463,Thus far, 11,268 deaths have been reported from the 258,842 confirmed infections in 168 countries.
32222463,In this study, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of the newly emerged coronavirus is modeled, validated, and then targeted using different anti-polymerase drugs currently on the market that have been approved for use against various viruses.
32222463,The results suggest the effectiveness of Ribavirin, Remdesivir, Sofosbuvir, Galidesivir, and Tenofovir as potent drugs against SARS-CoV-2 since they tightly bind to its RdRp.
32222463,In addition, the results suggest guanosine derivative (IDX-184), Setrobuvir, and YAK as top seeds for antiviral treatments with high potential to fight the SARS-CoV-2 strain specifically.
32222463,The availability of FDA-approved anti-RdRp drugs can help treat patients and reduce the danger of the mysterious new viral infection COVID-19.
32222463,The drugs mentioned above can tightly bind to the RdRp of the SARS-CoV-2 strain and thus may be used to treat the disease.
32222463,No toxicity measurements are required for these drugs since they were previously tested prior to their approval by the FDA.
32222466,The pandemic outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rapidly spreading all over the world.
32222466,Reports from China showed that about 20% of patients developed severe disease, resulting in a fatality of 4%.
32222466,In the past two months, we clinical immunologists participated in multi-rounds of MDT (multidiscipline team) discussion on the anti-inflammation management of critical COVID-19 patients, with our colleagues dispatched from Chinese leading PUMC Hospital to Wuhan to admit and treat the most severe patients.
32222466,Here, from the perspective of clinical immunologists, we will discuss the clinical and immunological characteristics of severe patients, and summarize the current evidence and share our experience in anti-inflammation treatment, including glucocorticoids, IL-6 antagonist, JAK inhibitors and choloroquine/hydrocholoroquine, of patients with severe COVID-19 that may have an impaired immune system.
32222703,Since December 2019, the epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread very rapidly in China and worldwide.
32222703,In this article, we report on a 75-year-old man infected with 2019 novel coronavirus who has end-stage kidney disease (ESKD).
32222703,COVID-19 patients with ESKD need isolation dialysis, but most of them cannot be handled in time due to limited continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) machines.
32222703,CRRT provided benefits for this patient by removing potentially damaging toxins and stabilizing his metabolic and hemodynamic status.
32222703,With the control of uremia and fluid status, this patient ended up with an uneventful post-CRRT course, absence of clinical symptoms, and negative PCR tests.
32222703,Greater efforts are needed to decrease the mortality of COVID-19-infected ESKD patients.
32222720,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak started in December 2019 that caused difficulties for clinical work.
32222720,Practical work experience in our spinal outpatient and emergency department during the COVID-19 pandemic is summarized in this article, with combined evidence-based medical evidence to explore a standardized process of diagnosis and treatment for spinal diseases.
32222720,Outpatient reservation, continuous screening, triage, and isolation, first consultation accountability system, pandemic reporting system, and online revisit were strictly followed.
32222720,We hope that our experience in prevention and control of COVID-19 can help spine surgeons globally in stopping the spread of COVID-19.
32222720,Spine surgeons should collaborate with infection control specialists to avoid cross-infection in hospitals and optimize treatment.
32222812,The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of a rapidly spreading illness, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), affecting thousands of people around the world.
32222812,Urgent guidance for clinicians caring for the sickest of these patients is needed.
32222812,We formed a panel of 36 experts from 12 countries.
32222812,All panel members completed the World Health Organization conflict of interest disclosure form.
32222812,The panel proposed 53 questions that are relevant to the management of COVID-19 in the ICU.
32222812,We searched the literature for direct and indirect evidence on the management of COVID-19 in critically ill patients in the ICU.
32222812,We identified relevant and recent systematic reviews on most questions relating to supportive care.
32222812,We assessed the certainty in the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, then generated recommendations based on the balance between benefit and harm, resource and cost implications, equity, and feasibility.
32222812,Recommendations were either strong or weak, or in the form of best practice recommendations.
32222812,The Surviving Sepsis Campaign COVID-19 panel issued 54 statements, of which 4 are best practice statements, 9 are strong recommendations, and 35 are weak recommendations.
32222812,No recommendation was provided for 6 questions.
32222812,The topics were: (1) infection control, (2) laboratory diagnosis and specimens, (3) hemodynamic support, (4) ventilatory support, and (5) COVID-19 therapy.
32222812,The Surviving Sepsis Campaign COVID-19 panel issued several recommendations to help support healthcare workers caring for critically ill ICU patients with COVID-19.
32222812,When available, we will provide new recommendations in further releases of these guidelines.
32222992,Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a newly emerging infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32222992,After its first occurrence in Wuhan of China from December 2019, COVID-19 rapidly spread around the world.
32222992,According to the World Health Organization statement on 13 March 2020, there had been over 132 500 confirmed cases globally.
32222992,Nevertheless, the case reports of children are rare, which results in the lack of evidence for preventing and controlling of children's infection.
32222992,Here, we report three cases of SARS-CoV-2 infected children diagnosed from 3 February to 17 February 2020 in Tianjin, China.
32222992,All of these three cases experienced mild illness and recovered soon after the treatment, with the nucleic acid of throat swab turning negative within 14, 11, and 7 days after diagnosis, respectively.
32222992,However, after been discharged, all three cases were tested SARS-CoV-2 positive in the stool samples within 10 days, in spite of their remained negative nucleic acid in throat swab specimens.
32222992,Therefore, it is necessary to be aware of the possibility of fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially for children cases.
32223003,Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a complex disease with elevated risk of respiratory comorbidities.<sup>1,2</sup> Severely affected patients are often treated with immune-modulating systemic drugs.<sup>3,4</sup> On March 11th 2020, the World Health Organization declared the 2019 novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-Cov-2) epidemic to be a pandemic.
32223003,The number of cases worldwide is increasing exponentially and poses a major health threat, especially for those who are elderly, immuno-compromised, or have comorbidities.
32223003,This also applies to AD patients on systemic immune-modulating treatment.
32223003,In these days of uncertainty, reallocation of medical resources, curfew, hoarding, and shutdown of normal social life, patients, caregivers and doctors ask questions regarding the continuation of systemic immune-modulating treatment of AD patients.
32223003,The ETFAD decided to address some of these questions here.
32223012,Assessment of possible infection with SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus responsible for COVID-19 illness, has been a major activity of infection services since the first reports of cases in December 2019.
32223012,We report a series of 68 patients assessed at a Regional Infection Unit in the UK.
32223012,Between 29 January 2020 and 24 February 2020, demographic, clinical, epidemiological and laboratory data were collected.
32223012,We compared clinical features between patients not requiring admission for clinical reasons or antimicrobials with those assessed as needing either admission or antimicrobial treatment.
32223012,Patients assessed were aged from 0 to 76 years; 36/68 were female.
32223012,Peaks of clinical assessments coincided with updates to the case definition for suspected COVID-19.
32223012,Microbiological diagnoses included SARS-CoV-2, mycoplasma pneumonia, influenza A, non-SARS/MERS coronaviruses and rhinovirus/enterovirus.
32223012,Nine of sixty-eight received antimicrobials, 15/68 were admitted, 5 due to inability to self-isolate.
32223012,Patients requiring admission on clinical grounds or antimicrobials (14/68) were more likely to have fever or raised respiratory rate compared to those not requiring admission or antimicrobials.
32223012,The majority of patients had mild illness, which did not require clinical intervention.
32223012,This finding supports a community testing approach, supported by clinicians able to review more unwell patients.
32223012,Extensions of the epidemiological criteria for the case definition of suspected COVID-19 lead to increased screening intensity; strategies must be in place to accommodate this in time for forthcoming changes as the epidemic develops.
32223665,<b>OBJECTIVE.</b> This study aims to assess correlations of the time from symptom onset to diagnosis and treatment with the time to disease resolution and CT scores as based on findings from sequential chest CT examinations. <b>MATERIALS AND METHODS.</b> Thirty patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis underwent chest CT examinations.
32223665,Five patients who did not have positive CT findings or who had not yet fulfilled criteria for discharge from the hospital were excluded.
32223665,CT scores were determined according to CT findings and lung involvement.
32223665,The time from symptom onset to diagnosis and treatment was recorded for each patient, and on the basis of this information, patients with COVID-19 were divided into group 1 (patients for whom this interval was ≤ 3 days) and group 2 (those for whom this interval was &gt; 3 days).
32223665,The CT scores for each group were fitted using a Lorentzian line-shape curve to show the variation tendency during treatment.
32223665,The differences in age, sex, and last CT scores determined before discharge between the two groups were analyzed, and correlations of the time from symptom onset to diagnosis and treatment with the time to disease resolution as well as with the highest CT score also underwent statistical analysis. <b>RESULTS.</b> A total of 25 subjects were enrolled in the study.
32223665,The fitted tendency curves for group 1 and group 2 were significantly different, with peak points showing that the estimated highest CT score was 10 and 16 for each group, respectively, and the time to disease resolution was 6 and 13 days, respectively.
32223665,The Mann-Whitney test showed that the last CT scores were lower for group 1 than for group 2 (<i>p</i> = 0.025), although the chi-square test found no difference in age and sex between the groups.
32223665,The time from symptom onset to diagnosis and treatment had a positive correlation with the time to disease resolution (<i>r</i> = 0.93; <i>p</i> = 0.000) as well as with the highest CT score (<i>r</i> = 0.83; <i>p</i> = 0.006). <b>CONCLUSION.</b> Timely diagnosis and treatment are key to providing a better prognosis for patients with COVID-19.
32223840,<b>Objective:</b> To collect the current status and healthcare needs of people living with HIV (PLHIV) in China during the COVID-19 outbreak to inform quick response from government and communities. <b>Methods:</b> During February 5(th) to 10(th) , 2020, a national anonymous survey was conducted using an online questionnaire among PLHIV at least 18 years of age and had started antiretroviral treatment (ART) to collect the information on COVID-19 prevention, HIV-related health services and the needs on psychosocial support.
32223840,Current status and needs of people living with HIV were analyzed in Hubei and other regions. <b>Results:</b> A total of 1 014 valid questionnaires were collected, with PLHIV respondents cross the country.
32223840,The survey revealed that 93.79% of the respondents could obtain information regarding the prevention of COVID-19 from their communities or villages.
32223840,Respondents were concerned with HIV-specific protective measures and personal protective equipment shortage.
32223840,32.64% of all respondents were not carrying sufficient antiretroviral medicines (ARVs) to meet the needs under traffic and travel restrictions, and some could face stock-outs in the coming month.
32223840,In Hubei province where 53 respondents needed ARV refill, 64.15% reported difficulty accessing ARV due to the &quot;blockage&quot;.
32223840,28.93% respondents were in need of sociopsychological support, and 85.31% anticipated further improvement of the out-of-town ARV refill process from the government. <b>Conclusion:</b> PLHIV wants to know HIV-specific protective measures against COVID-19 outbreak.
32223840,PLHIV who returned to their home-towns and affected by the lock-downs reported challenges with refills.
32223840,We should undertake a more systematic study on impacts of the COVID-19 on PLHIV to develop preparedness capacity for future public health emergency. <b>目的：</b> 了解新型冠状病毒肺炎暴发流行对HIV感染者卫生需求影响，为政府和感染者社区快速制定应对措施提供参考依据。
32223840,<b>方法：</b> 于2020年2月5--10日，通过网络招募年满18周岁并已开始服用抗反转录病毒药物（ARV）的HIV感染者参加网络匿名调查，了解新型冠状病毒肺炎流行期间，受访者在预防新型冠状病毒肺炎、获取HIV防治相关服务和心理支持需求等方面的信息。
32223840,<b>结果：</b> 调查共收集1 014份来自全国各省的HIV感染者的调查问卷，93.79%的调查对象表示自己所在的社区提供了新型冠状病毒肺炎的预防信息，同时更加关心HIV感染者相关的新型冠状病毒肺炎预防措施以及防护品短缺问题；32.64%的调查对象表示自己现有的ARV不足以满足交通和旅行管制期间的需求，其中部分感染者在未来1个月面临断药风险。
32223840,湖北省需要补充药物的HIV感染者中，64.15%的人表示因为&quot;封锁和行动受限&quot;而难以获得HIV治疗药物。
32223840,调查还发现，28.93%的调查对象希望获得社会心理支持；对政府的期待方面，85.31%的调查对象希望可以进一步完善HIV感染者异地取药流程。
32223840,<b>结论：</b> HIV感染者希望了解该人群预防新型冠状病毒肺炎暴发的相关信息，部分返乡或居住在交通管制地区的感染者，仍存在定期领药等方面的困难。
32223840,疫情形势下，HIV感染者获取药物面临困难，我们应当进一步开展系统调查了解新型冠状病毒肺炎流行对HIV感染的影响，并提高卫生系统应急储备和处置能力。.
32224074,Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China in December 2019, considerable attention has been focused on its elucidation.
32224074,However, it is also important for clinicians and epidemiologists to differentiate COVID-19 from other respiratory infectious diseases such as influenza viruses.
32224074,The aim of this study was to explore the different clinical presentations between COVID-19 and influenza A (H1N1) pneumonia in patients with ARDS.
32224074,This analysis was a retrospective case-control study.
32224074,Two independent cohorts of patients with ARDS infected with either COVID-19 (n = 73) or H1N1 (n = 75) were compared.
32224074,Their clinical manifestations, imaging characteristics, treatments, and prognosis were analyzed and compared.
32224074,The median age of patients with COVID-19 was higher than that of patients with H1N1, and there was a higher proportion of male subjects among the COVID-19 cohort (P &lt; .05).
32224074,Patients with COVID-19 exhibited higher proportions of nonproductive coughs, fatigue, and GI symptoms than those of patients with H1N1 (P &lt; .05).
32224074,Patients with H1N1 had higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores than patients with COVID-19 (P &lt; .05).
32224074,The Pao<sub>2</sub>/Fio<sub>2</sub> of 198.2 mm Hg in the COVID-19 cohort was significantly higher than the Pao<sub>2</sub>/Fio<sub>2</sub> of 107.0 mm Hg in the H1N1 cohort (P &lt; .001).
32224074,Ground-glass opacities was more common in patients with COVID-19 than in patients with H1N1 (P &lt; .001).
32224074,There was a greater variety of antiviral therapies administered to COVID-19 patients than to H1N1 patients.
32224074,The in-hospital mortality of patients with COVID-19 was 28.8%, whereas that of patients with H1N1 was 34.7% (P = .483).
32224074,SOFA score-adjusted mortality of H1N1 patients was significantly higher than that of COVID-19 patients, with a rate ratio of 2.009 (95% CI, 1.563-2.583; P &lt; .001).
32224074,There were many differences in clinical presentations between patients with ARDS infected with either COVID-19 or H1N1.
32224074,Compared with H1N1 patients, patients with COVID-19-induced ARDS had lower severity of illness scores at presentation and lower SOFA score-adjusted mortality.
32224151,Cancer patients are regarded as a highly vulnerable group in the current Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
32224151,To date, the clinical characteristics of COVID-19-infected cancer patients are largely unknown.
32224151,In this retrospective cohort study, we included cancer patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 from three designated hospitals in Wuhan, China.
32224151,The clinical data were collected from medical records from Jan 13, 2020, to Feb 26, 2020.
32224151,Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess the risk factors associated with severe events defined as a condition requiring admission to an intensive care unit, the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.
32224151,28 COVID-19-infected cancer patients were included; 17 (60.7%) patients were male.
32224151,Median age was 65.0 years (IQR:56.0-70.0).
32224151,Lung cancer was the most frequent cancer type (7, 25.0%).
32224151,8 (28.6%) patients were suspected to be from hospital-associated transmission.
32224151,The following clinical features were shown in our cohort: fever (23, 82.1%), dry cough (22, 81%) and dyspnoea (14, 50.0%), along with lymphopaenia (23, 82.1%), high level of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (23, 82.1%), anaemia (21, 75.0%) and hypoproteinaemia (25, 89.3%).
32224151,The common chest CT findings were ground-glass opacity (21, 75.0%) and patchy consolidation (13, 46.3%).
32224151,15 (53.6%) patients had severe events and mortality was 28.6%.
32224151,If the last anti-tumour treatment was within 14 days, it significantly increased the risk of developing severe events (HR=4.079, 95%CI 1.086-15.322, P=0.037).
32224151,Furthermore, patchy consolidation on CT on admission was associated with a higher risk for developing severe events (HR=5.438, 95%CI 1.498-19.748, P=0.010).
32224151,Cancer patients show deteriorating conditions and poor outcomes from the COVID-19 infection.
32224151,It is recommended that cancer patients receiving anti-tumour treatments should have vigorous screening for COVID-19 infection and should avoid treatments causing immunosuppression or have their dosages decreased in case of COVID-19 co-infection.
32224232,In the event of a global infectious pandemic, drastic measures may be needed that limit or require adjustment of ambulatory allergy services.
32224232,However, no rationale for how to prioritize service shut down and patient care exists.
32224232,A consensus-based ad-hoc expert panel of allergy/immunology specialists from the United States and Canada developed a service and patient prioritization schematic to temporarily triage allergy/immunology services.
32224232,Recommendations and feedback were developed iteratively, using an adapted modified Delphi methodology to achieve consensus.
32224232,During the ongoing pandemic while social distancing is being encouraged, most allergy/immunology care could be postponed/delayed or handled through virtual care.
32224232,With the exception of many patients with primary immunodeficiency, patients on venom immunotherapy, and patients with asthma of a certain severity, there is limited need for face-to-face visits under such conditions.
32224232,These suggestions are intended to help provide a logical approach to quickly adjust service to mitigate risk to both medical staff and patients.
32224232,Importantly, individual community circumstances may be unique and require contextual consideration.
32224232,The decision to enact any of these measures rests with the judgment of each clinician and individual health care system.
32224232,Pandemics are unanticipated, and enforced social distancing/quarantining is highly unusual.
32224232,This expert panel consensus document offers a prioritization rational to help guide decision making when such situations arise and an allergist/immunologist is forced to reduce services or makes the decision on his or her own to do so.
32224769,The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of a rapidly spreading illness, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), affecting thousands of people around the world.
32224769,Urgent guidance for clinicians caring for the sickest of these patients is needed.
32224769,We formed a panel of 36 experts from 12 countries.
32224769,All panel members completed the World Health Organization conflict of interest disclosure form.
32224769,The panel proposed 53 questions that are relevant to the management of COVID-19 in the ICU.
32224769,We searched the literature for direct and indirect evidence on the management of COVID-19 in critically ill patients in the ICU.
32224769,We identified relevant and recent systematic reviews on most questions relating to supportive care.
32224769,We assessed the certainty in the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, then generated recommendations based on the balance between benefit and harm, resource and cost implications, equity, and feasibility.
32224769,Recommendations were either strong or weak, or in the form of best practice recommendations.
32224769,The Surviving Sepsis Campaign COVID-19 panel issued 54 statements, of which four are best practice statements, nine are strong recommendations, and 35 are weak recommendations.
32224769,No recommendation was provided for six questions.
32224769,The topics were: 1) infection control, 2) laboratory diagnosis and specimens, 3) hemodynamic support, 4) ventilatory support, and 5) COVID-19 therapy.
32224769,The Surviving Sepsis Campaign COVID-19 panel issued several recommendations to help support healthcare workers caring for critically ill ICU patients with COVID-19.
32224769,When available, we will provide new evidence in further releases of these guidelines.
32226003,Before the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in 2003, coronaviruses (CoVs) were not considered to be highly pathogenic to humans.
32226003,However, it was this epidemic that highlighted this group of viruses and included them among the causative agents of emerging epidemic diseases.
32226003,In addition, in 2012, another new CoV responsible for the Middle East respiratory syndrome was identified.
32226003,Both infections were considered a threat to global health security.
32226003,At present, the third epidemic caused by a CoV is being faced.
32226003,This new CoV, called 2019-nCoV, was originated in the city of Wuhan, China, and has been linked to severe respiratory infections in humans.
32226003,Thanks to the collaboration of experts worldwide, more information about this virus and its infection is reported each day, which allows modifying the recommendations for its prevention and treatment, without forgetting that the ultimate goal is to control this epidemic.
32226003,In this review, the important aspects of this new coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, and its disease, COVID-19, have been summarized with the information available up to February 2020.
32226003,Previo al brote del síndrome respiratorio agudo grave de 2003, los coronavirus (CoV) no eran considerados como agentes altamente patogénicos para los humanos.
32226003,Sin embargo, fue dicha epidemia la que destacó este grupo de virus y lo incluyó entre los agentes causantes de enfermedades epidémicas emergentes.
32226003,Adicionalmente, en 2012 se identificó un nuevo CoV causante del síndrome respiratorio de Oriente Medio.
32226003,Ambas infecciones fueron consideradas una amenaza para la seguridad sanitaria mundial.
32226003,Hoy en día se presenta la tercera epidemia causada por un CoV.
32226003,Este nuevo CoV, llamado 2019-nCoV, se originó en la ciudad de Wuhan, China, y ha sido relacionado con infecciones respiratorias graves en humanos.
32226003,Gracias a la colaboración de expertos en todo el mundo, cada día se logra obtener más información sobre este virus y la infección que causa, lo cual permite modificar las recomendaciones para su prevención y tratamiento sin olvidar que el fin último es lograr el control de la epidemia.
32226003,En esta revisión se resumen los aspectos más importantes acerca del nuevo 2019-nCoV y la enfermedad COVID-19, con la información disponible hasta febrero de 2020.
32226287,As a city famous for tourism, the public healthcare system of Macau SAR has been under great pressure during the outbreak of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32226287,In this study, we report clinical and microbiological features of ten COVID-19 patients enrolled in the Centro Hospitalar Conde de São Januário (CHCSJ) between January 21 to February 16, 2020.
32226287,Clinical samples from all patients including nasopharyngeal swab (NPS)/sputum, urine, and feces were collected for serial virus RNA testing by standard qRT-PCR assay.
32226287,In total, seven were imported cases and three were local cases.
32226287,The median duration from Macau arrival to admission in imported cases was 3 days.
32226287,Four patients required oxygen therapy but none of them needed machinal ventilation.
32226287,No fatal cases were noted.
32226287,The most common symptoms were fever (80%) and diarrhea (80%).
32226287,In the &quot;Severe&quot; group, there was significantly more elderly patients (p=0.045), higher lactate dehydrogenase levels (p=0.002), and elevated C-Reactive protein levels compared to the &quot;Mild to Moderate&quot; group (p&lt;0.001).
32226287,There were positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA signals in all patients' NPS and stool specimens but negative in all urine specimens.
32226287,Based on our data on SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding in stool and the possibility of a lag in viral detection in NPS specimens, the assessment of both fecal and respiratory specimen is recommended to enhance diagnostic sensitivity, and also to aid discharge decision before the role of viral RNA shedding in stool is clarified.
32226288,Currently, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, formerly known as 2019-nCoV, the causative pathogen of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)) has rapidly spread across China and around the world, causing an outbreak of acute infectious pneumonia.
32226288,No specific anti-virus drugs or vaccines are available for the treatment of this sudden and lethal disease.
32226288,The supportive care and non-specific treatment to ameliorate the symptoms of the patient are the only options currently.
32226288,At the top of these conventional therapies, greater than 85% of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients in China are receiving Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) treatment.
32226288,In this article, relevant published literatures are thoroughly reviewed and current applications of TCM in the treatment of COVID-19 patients are analyzed.
32226288,Due to the homology in epidemiology, genomics, and pathogenesis of the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, and the widely use of TCM in the treatment of SARS-CoV, the clinical evidence showing the beneficial effect of TCM in the treatment of patients with SARS coronaviral infections are discussed.
32226288,Current experiment studies that provide an insight into the mechanism underlying the therapeutic effect of TCM, and those studies identified novel naturally occurring compounds with anti-coronaviral activity are also introduced.
32226289,A newly identified novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is causing pneumonia-associated respiratory syndrome across the world.
32226289,Epidemiology, genomics, and pathogenesis of the SARS-CoV-2 show high homology with that of SARS-CoV.
32226289,Current efforts are focusing on development of specific antiviral drugs.
32226289,Therapeutic neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against SARS-CoV-2 will be greatly important therapeutic agents for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32226289,Herein, the host immune responses against SARS-CoV discussed in this review provide implications for developing NAbs and understanding clinical interventions against SARS-CoV-2.
32226289,Further, we describe the benefits, challenges and considerations of NAbs against SARS-CoV-2.
32226289,Although many challenges exist, NAbs still offer a therapeutic option to control the current pandemic and the possible re-emergence of the virus in the future, and their development therefore remains a high priority.
32226290,Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a group of enveloped, single-stranded positive genomic RNA viruses and some of them are known to cause severe respiratory diseases in human, including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and the ongoing coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19).
32226290,One key element in viral infection is the process of viral entry into the host cells.
32226290,In the last two decades, there is increasing understanding on the importance of the endocytic pathway and the autophagy process in viral entry and replication.
32226290,As a result, the endocytic pathway including endosome and lysosome has become important targets for development of therapeutic strategies in combating diseases caused by CoVs.
32226290,In this mini-review, we will focus on the importance of the endocytic pathway as well as the autophagy process in viral infection of several pathogenic CoVs inclusive of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the new CoV named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and discuss the development of therapeutic agents by targeting these processes.
32226290,Such knowledge will provide important clues for control of the ongoing epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 infection and treatment of COVID-19.
32226295,The outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has thus far killed over 3,000 people and infected over 80,000 in China and elsewhere in the world, resulting in catastrophe for humans.
32226295,Similar to its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 might also be transmitted from the bats and causes similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
32226295,However, COVID-19 has lower severity and mortality than SARS but is much more transmissive and affects more elderly individuals than youth and more men than women.
32226295,In response to the rapidly increasing number of publications on the emerging disease, this article attempts to provide a timely and comprehensive review of the swiftly developing research subject.
32226295,We will cover the basics about the epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and prevention of the disease.
32226295,Although many questions still require answers, we hope that this review helps in the understanding and eradication of the threatening disease.
32226695,Effective treatments for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak are urgently needed.
32226695,While anti-viral approaches and vaccines are being considered immediate countermeasures are unavailable.
32226695,The aim of this article is to outline a perspective on the pathophysiology of COVID-19 in the context of the currently available clinical data published in the literature.
32226695,This article appreciates clinical data published on COVID-19 in the context of another respiratory illness - high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE).
32226695,Both conditions have significant similarities that portend pathophysiologic trajectories.
32226695,Following this potential treatment options emerge.
32226695,Both COVID-19 and HAPE exhibit a decreased ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen with concomitant hypoxia and tachypnea.
32226695,There also appears to be a tendency for low carbon dioxide levels in both as well.
32226695,Radiologic findings of ground glass opacities are present in up to 86% of patients with COVID-19 in addition to patchy infiltrates.
32226695,Patients with HAPE also exhibit patchy infiltrates throughout the pulmonary fields, often in an asymmetric pattern and CT findings reveal increased lung markings and ground glass-like changes as well.
32226695,Widespread ground-glass opacities are most commonly a manifestation of hydrostatic pulmonary edema.
32226695,Similarly, elevated fibrinogen levels in both conditions are likely an <i>epiphenomenon of edema formation</i> rather than coagulation activation.
32226695,Autopsy results of a COVID-19 fatality revealed bilateral diffuse alveolar damage associated with pulmonary edema, pro-inflammatory concentrates, and indications of early-phase acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
32226695,HAPE itself is initially caused by an increase in pulmonary capillary pressure and induces altered alveolar-capillary permeability via high pulmonary artery hydrostatic pressures that lead to a protein-rich and mildly hemorrhagic edema.
32226695,It appears that COVID-19 and HAPE both discretely converge on ARDS.
32226695,In light of this, a countermeasure that has been shown to be effective in the analogous condition of HAPE is Acetazolamide.
32226695,Acetazolamide has a myriad of effects on different organ systems, potently reduces hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, improves minute ventilation and expired vital capacity.
32226695,Other therapeutics to consider that are also directed towards decreased pulmonary pressure include Nifedipine and Phosphodiesterase inhibitors.
32226695,This review describes COVID-19 in parallel to HAPE.
32226695,Deranged respiratory parameters that are present in both conditions are highlighted.
32226695,The utilization of medications found to be effective in HAPE, for the treatment of COVID-19, is proposed.
32226695,Given the medical emergency of a growing contagion and the thousands of lives at stake, expedient attempts to improve survival are needed.
32226695,Acetazolamide, Nifedipine and Phosphodiesterase inhibitors may be potential countermeasures.
32227090,A new type of pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks recently in China and spreads into many other countries.
32227090,This disease, named as COVID-19, is similar to patients infected by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and nearly 20% of patients developed severe condition.
32227090,Cardiac injury is a prevalent complication of severe patients, exacerbating the disease severity in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients.
32227090,Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the key host cellular receptor of SARS-CoV-2, has been identified in multiple organs, but its cellular distribution in human heart is not illuminated clearly.
32227090,This study performed the first state-of-art single cell atlas of adult human heart, and revealed that pericytes with high expression of ACE2 might act as the target cardiac cell of SARS-CoV-2.
32227090,The pericytes injury due to virus infection may result in capillary endothelial cells dysfunction, inducing microvascular dysfunction.
32227090,And patients with basic heart failure disease showed increased ACE2 expression at both mRNA and protein levels, meaning that if infected by the virus these patients may have higher risk of heart attack and critically ill condition.
32227090,The finding of this study explains the high rate of severe cases among COVID-19 patients with basic cardiovascular disease; and these results also perhaps provide important reference to clinical treatment of cardiac injury among severe patients infected by SARS-CoV-2.
32227123,Since December 2019, novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)-infected pneumonia (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, and rapidly spread throughout China.
32227123,We aimed to clarify the characteristics and clinical significance of peripheral lymphocyte subset alteration in COVID-19.
32227123,The levels of peripheral lymphocyte subsets were measured by flow cytometry in 60 hospitalized COVID-19 patients before and after treatment, and their association with clinical characteristics and treatment efficacy was analyzed.
32227123,Total lymphocytes, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, B cells and natural killer (NK) cells decreased in COVID-19 patients, and severe cases had a lower level than mild cases.
32227123,The subsets showed a significant association with the inflammatory status in COVID-19, especially CD8+ T cells and CD4+/CD8+ ratio.
32227123,After treatment, 37 patients (67%) reached clinical response, with an increase of CD8+ T cells and B cells.
32227123,No significant change of any subset was detected in non-response cases.
32227123,In multivariate analysis, post-treatment decrease of CD8+ T cells and B cells and increase of CD4+/CD8+ ratio were indicated as independent predictors for poor efficacy.
32227123,Peripheral lymphocyte subset alteration was associated with the clinical characteristics and treatment efficacy of COVID-19.
32227123,CD8+ T cells tended to be an independent predictor for COVID-19 severity and treatment efficacy.
32227274,This study aims to evaluate the correlation between viral clearance and blood biochemical index of 94 discharged patients with COVID-19 infection in Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, enrolled from Jan 5 to Feb 13, 2020.
32227274,The clinical and laboratory findings were extracted from the electronic medical records of the patients.
32227274,The data were analysed and reviewed by a trained team of physicians.
32227274,Information on clinical signs and symptoms, medical treatment, virus clearance, and laboratory parameters including interleukin 6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein were collected.
32227274,COVID-19 mRNA clearance ratio was identified significantly correlated with the decline of serum creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels.
32227274,Furthermore, COVID-19 mRNA clearance time was positively correlated with the length of hospital stay in patients treated with either IFN-α + lopinavir/ritonavir or IFN-α + lopinavir/ritonavir + ribavirin.
32227274,Therapeutic regimens of IFN-α + lopinavir/ritonavir and IFN-α + lopinavir/ritonavir + ribavirin might be beneficial for treatment of COVID-19.
32227274,Serum LDH or CK decline may predict a favorable response to treatment of COVID-19 infection.
32227357,Corona virus disease (COVID-19) has created pandemic in the world as declared by WHO on March 12, 2020.
32227357,It is a viral disease caused by SARS-CoV 2 virus and has affected large populations in over 120 countries.
32227357,There is no specific treatment available and management is empirical.
32227357,Until such time that an effective vaccine is available for COVID-19 viral infection, one can repurpose known therapeutic drug molecules such as angiotensin receptor 2 blocker, a commonly used antihypertensive drug, to control COVID-19 virus from gaining entry into the host cell by blocking the angiotensin receptor.
32227357,Clinical trials should also be undertaken to use statins, which are lipid-lowering drugs but have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties to prevent acute lung injury in COVID-19 infection.
32227493,Confronting the challenge of the outbreak of COVID-19 should sharpen our focus on global drug access as a key issue in antiviral therapy testing.
32227493,The testing and adoption of effective therapies for novel coronaviruses are hampered by the challenge of conducting controlled studies during a state of emergency.
32227493,The access to direct antiviral drugs, such as ribavirin, that have an existing inventory and reliable supply chain may be a priority consideration for therapies developed for the 2019-nCoV infection outbreaks and any strain variants that may emerge.
32227493,On the basis of the direct antiviral activity of ribavirin against 2019-nCoV in vitro and evidence for potency enhancement strategies developed during the prior SARS and MERS outbreaks, ribavirin may significantly impact our ability to end the lingering outbreaks in China and slow outbreaks in other countries.
32227493,The apparent COVID-19 pandemic provides an opportunity to follow dosage guidelines for treatment with ribavirin, test new therapeutic concepts, and conduct controlled testing to apply the scientific rigor required to address the controversy around this mainstay of antiviral therapy.
32227596,To outline strategies for the treatment of migraine which do not require in-person visits to clinic or the emergency department, and to describe ways that health insurance companies can remove barriers to quality care for migraine.
32227596,COVID-19 is a global pandemic causing widespread infections and death.
32227596,To control the spread of infection we are called to observe &quot;social distancing&quot; and we have been asked to postpone any procedures which are not essential.
32227596,Since procedural therapies are a mainstay of headache care, the inability to do procedures could negatively affect our patients with migraine.
32227596,In this manuscript we review alternative therapies, with particular attention to those which may be contra-indicated in the setting of COVID-19 infection.
32227596,The manuscript reviews the use of telemedicine visits and acute, bridge, and preventive therapies for migraine.
32227596,We focus on evidence-based treatment where possible, but also describe &quot;real world&quot; strategies which may be tried.
32227596,In each section we call out areas where changes to rules from commercial health insurance companies would facilitate better migraine care.
32227596,Our common goal as health care providers is to maximize the health and safety of our patients.
32227596,Successful management of migraine with avoidance of in-person clinic and emergency department visits further benefits the current urgent societal goal of maintaining social distance to contain the COVID-19 pandemic.
32227609,The COVID-19 outbreak in Italy is stopping access to elective benign disease treatment and changing the approach to malignant disease as well as the outpatients care of those patients treated for colorectal cancer.
32227609,The lack of knowledge about the possible implications of the spread of the infection during surgery could extend to infect surgeons, surgery nurses and also the anesthesiologists, the results will become evident in the long term.
32227609,The surgical approach may change going towards less invasive procedures to minimize the aerosolized biological fluids, this approach could reduce the access to first level hospitals changing the entire health care system in the future.
32227758,Community transmission of coronavirus 2019 (Covid-19) was detected in the state of Washington in February 2020.
32227758,We identified patients from nine Seattle-area hospitals who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with confirmed infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32227758,Clinical data were obtained through review of medical records.
32227758,The data reported here are those available through March 23, 2020.
32227758,Each patient had at least 14 days of follow-up.
32227758,We identified 24 patients with confirmed Covid-19.
32227758,The mean (±SD) age of the patients was 64±18 years, 63% were men, and symptoms began 7±4 days before admission.
32227758,The most common symptoms were cough and shortness of breath; 50% of patients had fever on admission, and 58% had diabetes mellitus.
32227758,All the patients were admitted for hypoxemic respiratory failure; 75% (18 patients) needed mechanical ventilation.
32227758,Most of the patients (17) also had hypotension and needed vasopressors.
32227758,No patient tested positive for influenza A, influenza B, or other respiratory viruses.
32227758,Half the patients (12) died between ICU day 1 and day 18, including 4 patients who had a do-not-resuscitate order on admission.
32227758,Of the 12 surviving patients, 5 were discharged home, 4 were discharged from the ICU but remained in the hospital, and 3 continued to receive mechanical ventilation in the ICU.
32227758,During the first 3 weeks of the Covid-19 outbreak in the Seattle area, the most common reasons for admission to the ICU were hypoxemic respiratory failure leading to mechanical ventilation, hypotension requiring vasopressor treatment, or both.
32227758,Mortality among these critically ill patients was high.
32227758,(Funded by the National Institutes of Health.).
32228222,The dysfunction of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been observed in coronavirus infection disease (COVID-19) patients, but whether RAS inhibitors, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs), are associated with clinical outcomes remains unknown.
32228222,COVID-19 patients with hypertension were enrolled to evaluate the effect of RAS inhibitors.
32228222,We observed that patients receiving ACEI or ARB therapy had a lower rate of severe diseases and a trend toward a lower level of IL-6 in peripheral blood.
32228222,In addition, ACEI or ARB therapy increased CD3 and CD8 T cell counts in peripheral blood and decreased the peak viral load compared to other antihypertensive drugs.
32228222,This evidence supports the benefit of using ACEIs or ARBs to potentially contribute to the improvement of clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients with hypertension.
32228226,Circulating in China and 158 other countries and areas, the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak has caused devastating mortality and posed a great threat to public health.
32228226,However, efforts to identify effectively supportive therapeutic drugs and treatments has been hampered by our limited understanding of host immune response for this fatal disease.
32228226,To characterize the transcriptional signatures of host inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 (HCoV-19) infection, we carried out transcriptome sequencing of the RNAs isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) specimens of COVID-19 patients.
32228226,Our results reveal distinct host inflammatory cytokine profiles to SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients, and highlight the association between COVID-19 pathogenesis and excessive cytokine release such as CCL2/MCP-1, CXCL10/IP-10, CCL3/MIP-1A, and CCL4/MIP1B.
32228226,Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 induced activation of apoptosis and P53 signalling pathway in lymphocytes may be the cause of patients' lymphopenia.
32228226,The transcriptome dataset of COVID-19 patients would be a valuable resource for clinical guidance on anti-inflammatory medication and understanding the molecular mechansims of host response.
32228252,The novel SARS coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 pandemic may be particularly deleterious to patients with underlying cardiovascular disease (CVD).
32228252,The mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 infection is the requisite binding of the virus to the membrane-bound form of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and internalization of the complex by the host cell.
32228252,Recognition that ACE2 is the coreceptor for the coronavirus has prompted new therapeutic approaches to block the enzyme or reduce its expression to prevent the cellular entry and SARS-CoV-2 infection in tissues that express ACE2 including lung, heart, kidney, brain, and gut.
32228252,ACE2, however, is a key enzymatic component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS); ACE2 degrades ANG II, a peptide with multiple actions that promote CVD, and generates Ang-(1-7), which antagonizes the effects of ANG II.
32228252,Moreover, experimental evidence suggests that RAAS blockade by ACE inhibitors, ANG II type 1 receptor antagonists, and mineralocorticoid antagonists, as well as statins, enhance ACE2 which, in part, contributes to the benefit of these regimens.
32228252,In lieu of the fact that many older patients with hypertension or other CVDs are routinely treated with RAAS blockers and statins, new clinical concerns have developed regarding whether these patients are at greater risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection, whether RAAS and statin therapy should be discontinued, and the potential consequences of RAAS blockade to COVID-19-related pathologies such as acute and chronic respiratory disease.
32228252,The current perspective critically examines the evidence for ACE2 regulation by RAAS blockade and statins, the cardiovascular benefits of ACE2, and whether ACE2 blockade is a viable approach to attenuate COVID-19.
32228809,We report epidemiologic, laboratory, and clinical findings for 7 patients with 2019 novel coronavirus disease in a 2-family cluster.
32228809,Our study confirms asymptomatic and human-to-human transmission through close contacts in familial and hospital settings.
32228809,These findings might also serve as a practical reference for clinical diagnosis and medical treatment.
32228825,SARS-CoV-2, also referred to as CoV-19, is an RNA virus which can cause severe acute respiratory diseases (COVID-19), with serious infection of the lower respiratory tract followed by bronchitis, pneumonia and fibrosis.
32228825,The severity of the disease depends on the efficiency of the immune system which, if it is weak, cannot stem the infection and its symptoms.
32228825,The new CoV-19 spreads in the population at a rate of 0.8-3% more than normal flu and mostly affects men, since immune genes are more expressed on the X chromosome.
32228825,If CoV-19 would spread with a higher incidence rate (over 10%), and affect the people who live in closed communities such as islands, it would cause many more deaths.
32228825,Moreover, people from the poorest classes are most at risk because of lack of health care and should be given more assistance by the competent authorities.
32228825,To avoid the aggravation of CoV-19 infection, and the collapse of the health system, individuals should remain at home in quarantine for a period of approximately one month in order to limit viral transmission.
32228825,In the case of a pandemic, the severe shortage of respirators and protective clothing, due to the enormous demand and insufficient production, could lead the CoV-19 to kill a large number of individuals.
32228825,At present, there is no drug capable of treating CoV-19 flu, the only therapeutic remedies are those aimed at the side effects caused by the virus, such as inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis, recognized as the first causes of death.
32228825,One of the COVID-19 treatments involves inhaling a mixture of gaseous hydrogen and oxygen, obtaining better results than with oxygen alone.
32228825,It was also noted that individuals vaccinated for viral and/or bacterial infectious diseases were less likely to become infected.
32228825,In addition, germicidal UV radiation &quot;breaks down&quot; the oxygen O2 which then aggregate into O3 (ozone) molecules creating the ozone layer, capable of inhibiting viral replication and improving lung respiration.
32228825,All these precautions should be taken into consideration to lower the risk of infection by CoV-19.
32228825,New anti-viral therapies with new drugs should also be taken into consideration.
32228825,For example, microbes are known to bind TLR, inducing IL-1, a pleiotropic cytokine, highly inflammatory, mediator of fever and fibrosis.
32228825,Therefore, drugs that suppress IL-1 or IL-1R, also used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis are to be taken into consideration to treat COVID-19.
32228825,We strongly believe that all these devices described above can lead to greater survival and. therefore, reduction in mortality in patients infected with CoV-19.
32228827,<b>Objective:</b> Present study investigated the mechanism of heart failure associated with coronavirus infection and predicted potential effective therapeutic drugs against heart failure associated with coronavirus infection. <b>Methods:</b> Coronavirus and heart failure were searched in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and omics data were selected to meet experimental requirements.

32228827,The drugs predicted by EpiMed's apparent precision treatment prediction platform for disease-drug association analysis are mainly TNF-α inhibitors, resveratrol, ritonavir, paeony, retinoic acid, forsythia, and houttuynia cordata. <b>Conclusions:</b> The abnormal activation of multiple inflammatory pathways may be the cause of heart failure in patients after coronavirus infection.
32228827,Resveratrol, ritonavir, retinoic acid, amaranth, forsythia, houttuynia may have therapeutic effects.

32229257,There are no clear expert consensus or guidelines on how to treat 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
32229257,The objective of this study is to investigate the short-term effect of risk-adapted treatment strategy on patients with COVID-19.
32229257,We collected the medical records of 55 COVID-19 patients for analysis.
32229257,We divided these patients into mild, moderate and severe groups, and risk-adapted treatment approaches were given according to the illness severity.
32229257,Twelve patients were in mild group and 22 were in moderate group (non-severe group, n=34), and 21 patients were in severe group.
32229257,At the end of the first two weeks after admission, clinical manifestations had completely despeared in 31(91.2%)patients in non-severe group, and 18(85.7%) patients in severe group (p=0.85).
32229257,Both groups had a satisfied chest CT imaging recovery, which includes 22(64.7%) patients in non-severe group and 12(57.1%) patients in severe group recovered at least 50% of the whole leisions in the first week, and 28(82.4%) and 16(76.2%) recovered at least 75% in the second week, respectively.
32229257,There were no significant differences in SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance between two group (p=0.92).
32229257,There were also no significant differences in the levels of SARS-CoV-2-IgM and IgG antibody production between the two groups (p=0.13, 0.62).
32229257,There were 45 cases were discharged from the hospital, and no patients died at the time of this clinical analysis.
32229257,Risk-adapted treatment strategy was associated with significant clinical manifestations alleviation and clinical imaging recovery.
32229257,In severe COVID-19 patients, early and short-term use of low-dose methylprednisolone was beneficial and did not delay SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance and influence IgG antibody production.
32229705,The recently identified SARS-CoV-2 betacoronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic has uncovered the age-associated vulnerability in the burden of disease and put aging research in the spotlight.
32229705,The limited data available indicates that COVID-19 should be referred to as a gerolavic (from Greek, géros &quot;old man&quot; and epilavís, &quot;harmful&quot;) infection because the infection rates, severity, and lethality are substantially higher in the population aged 60 and older.
32229705,This is primarily due to comorbidity but may be partially due to immunosenescence, decreased immune function in the elderly, and general loss of function, fitness, and increased frailty associated with aging.
32229705,Immunosenescence is a major factor affecting vaccination response, as well as the severity and lethality of infectious diseases.
32229705,While vaccination reduces infection rates, and therapeutic interventions reduce the severity and lethality of infections, these interventions have limitations.
32229705,Previous studies showed that postulated geroprotectors, such as sirolimus (rapamycin) and its close derivative rapalog everolimus (RAD001), decreased infection rates in a small sample of elderly patients.
32229705,This article presents a review of the limited literature available on geroprotective and senoremediative interventions that may be investigated to decrease the disease burden of gerolavic infections.
32229705,This article also highlights a need for rigorous clinical validation of deep aging clocks as surrogate markers of biological age.
32229705,These could be used to assess the need for, and efficacy of, geroprotective and senoremediative interventions and provide better protection for elderly populations from gerolavic infections.
32229705,This article does not represent medical advice and the medications described are not yet licensed or recommended as immune system boosters, as they have not undergone clinical evaluation for this purpose.
32229706,COVID-19, also known as SARS-CoV-2, is a new emerging zoonotic corona virus of the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and the MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) family.
32229706,COVID-19 originated in China and spread world-wide, resulting in the pandemic of 2020.
32229706,For some reason, COVID-19 shows a considerably higher mortality rate in patients with advanced chronological age.
32229706,This begs the question as to whether there is a functional association between COVID-19 infection and the process of chronological aging.
32229706,Two host receptors have been proposed for COVID-19.
32229706,One is CD26 and the other is ACE-2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2).
32229706,Interestingly, both CD26 and the angiotensin system show associations with senescence.
32229706,Similarly, two proposed therapeutics for the treatment of COVID-19 infection are Azithromycin and Quercetin, both drugs with significant senolytic activity.
32229706,Also, Chloroquine-related compounds inhibit the induction of the well-known senescence marker, Beta-galactosidase.
32229706,Other anti-aging drugs should also be considered, such as Rapamycin and Doxycycline, as they behave as inhibitors of protein synthesis, blocking both SASP and viral replication.
32229706,Therefore, we wish to speculate that the fight against COVID-19 disease should involve testing the hypothesis that senolytics and other anti-aging drugs may have a prominent role in preventing the transmission of the virus, as well as aid in its treatment.
32229706,Thus, we propose that new clinical trials may be warranted, as several senolytic and anti-aging therapeutics are existing FDA-approved drugs, with excellent safety profiles, and would be readily available for drug repurposing efforts.
32229706,As Azithromycin and Doxycycline are both commonly used antibiotics that inhibit viral replication and IL-6 production, we may want to consider this general class of antibiotics that functionally inhibits cellular protein synthesis as a side-effect, for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 disease.
32229732,Whether the patients with coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 would commonly develop acute kidney injury (AKI) is an important issue worthy of clinical attention.
32229732,This study aimed to explore the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on renal function through analyzing the clinical data of 116 hospitalized COVID-19-confirmed patients.
32229732,One hundred sixteen COVID-19-confirmed patients enrolled in this study were hospitalized in the Department of Infectious Diseases, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January 14 to February 13, 2020.
32229732,The recorded information includes demographic data, medical history, contact history, potential comorbidities, symptoms, signs, laboratory test results, chest computer tomography scans, and treatment measures.
32229732,SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 53 urine sediments of enrolled patients was detected by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.
32229732,Twelve (10.8%) patients showed mild increase of blood urea nitrogen or creatinine (&lt;26 μmol/L within 48 h), and 8 (7.2%) patients showed trace or 1+ albuminuria in 111 COVID-19-confirmed patients without chronic kidney disease (CKD).
32229732,All these patients did not meet the diagnostic criteria of AKI.
32229732,In addition, 5 patients with CKD who were undergone regular continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) before admission were confirmed infection of SARS-CoV-2 and diagnosed as COVID-19.
32229732,In addition to therapy for COVID-19, CRRT was also applied 3 times weekly during hospitalization for these 5 patients with CKD.
32229732,In the course of treatment, the renal function indicators showed stable state in all 5 patients with CKD, without exacerbation of CKD, and pulmonary inflammation was gradually absorbed.
32229732,All 5 patients with CKD were survived.
32229732,Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 RNA in urine sediments was positive only in 3 patients from 48 cases without CKD, and 1 patient had a positive for SARS-CoV-2 open reading frame 1ab from 5 cases with CKD.
32229732,AKI was uncommon in COVID-19.
32229732,SARS-CoV-2 infection does not result in AKI, or aggravate CKD in the COVID-19 patients.
32230900,The outbreak of emerging severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease (COVID-19) in China has been brought to global attention and declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020.
32230900,Scientific advancements since the pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002~2003 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012 have accelerated our understanding of the epidemiology and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and the development of therapeutics to treat viral infection.
32230900,As no specific therapeutics and vaccines are available for disease control, the epidemic of COVID-19 is posing a great threat for global public health.
32230900,To provide a comprehensive summary to public health authorities and potential readers worldwide, we detail the present understanding of COVID-19 and introduce the current state of development of measures in this review.
32231345,The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan, China has posed a serious threat to global public health.
32231345,To develop specific anti-coronavirus therapeutics and prophylactics, the molecular mechanism that underlies viral infection must first be defined.
32231345,Therefore, we herein established a SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein-mediated cell-cell fusion assay and found that SARS-CoV-2 showed a superior plasma membrane fusion capacity compared to that of SARS-CoV.
32231345,We solved the X-ray crystal structure of six-helical bundle (6-HB) core of the HR1 and HR2 domains in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein S2 subunit, revealing that several mutated amino acid residues in the HR1 domain may be associated with enhanced interactions with the HR2 domain.
32231345,We previously developed a pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor, EK1, which targeted the HR1 domain and could inhibit infection by divergent human coronaviruses tested, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
32231345,Here we generated a series of lipopeptides derived from EK1 and found that EK1C4 was the most potent fusion inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated membrane fusion and pseudovirus infection with IC50s of 1.3 and 15.8 nM, about 241- and 149-fold more potent than the original EK1 peptide, respectively.
32231345,EK1C4 was also highly effective against membrane fusion and infection of other human coronavirus pseudoviruses tested, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as SARSr-CoVs, and potently inhibited the replication of 5 live human coronaviruses examined, including SARS-CoV-2.
32231345,Intranasal application of EK1C4 before or after challenge with HCoV-OC43 protected mice from infection, suggesting that EK1C4 could be used for prevention and treatment of infection by the currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 and other emerging SARSr-CoVs.
32231348,The Novel corona virus 2019 which started as an outbreak in China in December 2019 has rapidly spread all over the world, such that on 11th March 2020 WHO declared this disease as pandemic.
32231348,The emergency that the world faces today demands that we develop urgent and effective measures to protect people at high risk of transmission.
32231348,WHO has accelerated research in diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics for this novel coronavirus.
32232214,SARS-CoV-2 is a newly emerging human infectious coronavirus that causes COVID-19, which has been recognized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11<sup>th</sup>.
32232214,There is still no vaccine or definitive treatment for this virus because its pathogenesis and proliferation pathways are still unknown.
32232214,Therefore, in this article, new potential COVID-19 therapies are briefly reviewed.
32232230,The newly emerged coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) which was first identified in China in December 2019.
32232230,It is a highly contagious infection that can spread from person to person through close contact and respiratory droplets.
32232230,The healthcare personnel of the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery are especially vulnerable to the infection due to their extensive and close exposure to patients' oral and nasal cavities and secretions.
32232230,As one of the busiest specialised hospitals in the world, the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery of Peking University School and Hospital of Stomatology summarised the experience with disease prevention and control and clinical recommendations on the examination, diagnosis and treatment processes, clinical management, healthcare personnel protection and disinfection amid the continued spread of the pandemic.
32232423,The rapidly expanding novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, has challenged the medical community to an unprecedented degree.
32232423,Physicians and health care workers are at added risk of exposure and infection during the course of patient care.
32232423,Because of the rapid spread of this disease through respiratory droplets, health care workers who come in close contact with the upper aerodigestive tract during diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, such as otolaryngologists-head and neck surgeons, are particularly at risk.
32232423,A set of safety recommendations was created based on a review of the literature and communications with physicians with firsthand knowledge of safety procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32232423,A high number of health care workers were infected during the first phase of the pandemic in the city of Wuhan, China.
32232423,Subsequently, by adopting strict safety precautions, other regions were able to achieve high levels of safety for health care workers without jeopardizing the care of patients.
32232423,The most common procedures related to the examination and treatment of upper aerodigestive tract diseases were reviewed.
32232423,Each category was reviewed based on the potential risk imposed to health care workers.
32232423,Specific recommendations were made based on the literature, when available, or consensus best practices.
32232423,Specific safety recommendations were made for performing tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19.
32232423,Preserving a highly skilled health care workforce is a top priority for any community and health care system.
32232423,Based on the experience of health care systems in Asia and Europe, by following strict safety guidelines, the risk of exposure and infection of health care workers could be greatly reduced while providing high levels of care.
32232423,The provided recommendations, which may evolve over time, could be used as broad guidance for all health care workers who are involved in the care of patients with COVID-19.
32232432,The novel coronavirus COVID-19 infection poses serious challenges to the healthcare system that are being addressed through the creation of new unique and advanced systems of care with disjointed care processes (telehealth screening, drive-through specimen collection, remote testing, telehealth management, etc.)
32232432,However, our current regulations on the flows of information for clinical care and research are antiquated and often conflict at the state and federal level.
32232432,This paper discusses proposed changes to privacy regulations such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability act (HIPAA) designed to let health information seamlessly and frictionlessly flow between the health entities that need to collaborate on treatment of patients and, also, allow it to flow to researchers trying to understand how to limit its impacts.
32232433,While the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in more than 100 000 infected individuals in China and worldwide, there are few reports on the association of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with ocular abnormalities.
32232433,Understanding ocular manifestations of patients with COVID-19 by ophthalmologists and others may facilitate the diagnosis and prevention of transmission of the disease.
32232433,To investigate ocular manifestations and viral prevalence in the conjunctiva of patients with COVID-19.
32232433,In this case series, patients with COVID-19 treated from February 9 to 15, 2020, at a hospital center in Hubei province, China, were retrospectively reviewed for ocular manifestations.
32232433,During the period of treatment, the ocular signs and symptoms as well as results of blood tests and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from nasopharyngeal and conjunctival swabs for SARS-CoV-2 were noted and analyzed.
32232433,Ocular signs and symptoms as well as results of blood tests and RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2.
32232433,Of the 38 included patients with clinically confirmed COVID-19, 25 (65.8%) were male, and the mean (SD) age was 65.8 (16.6) years.
32232433,Among them, 28 patients (73.7%) had positive findings for COVID-19 on RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs, and of these, 2 patients (5.2%) yielded positive findings for SARS-CoV-2 in their conjunctival as well as nasopharyngeal specimens.
32232433,A total of 12 of 38 patients (31.6%; 95% CI, 17.5-48.7) had ocular manifestations consistent with conjunctivitis, including conjunctival hyperemia, chemosis, epiphora, or increased secretions.
32232433,By univariate analysis, patients with ocular symptoms were more likely to have higher white blood cell and neutrophil counts and higher levels of procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, and lactate dehydrogenase than patients without ocular symptoms.
32232433,In addition, 11 of 12 patients with ocular abnormalities (91.7%; 95% CI, 61.5-99.8) had positive results for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs.
32232433,Of these, 2 (16.7%) had positive results for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR from both conjunctival and nasopharyngeal swabs.
32232433,In this study, one-third of patients with COVID-19 had ocular abnormalities, which frequently occurred in patients with more severe COVID-19.
32232433,Although there is a low prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in tears, it is possible to transmit via the eyes.
32232685,The outbreak of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)-infected pneumonia (NCIP) is currently ongoing in China.
32232685,Most of the critically ill patients received high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen therapy.
32232685,However, the experience of HFNC in this population is lacking.
32232685,We retrospectively screened 318 confirmed patients with NCIP in two hospitals of Chongqing, China, from January 1st to March 4th, 2020.
32232685,Among them, 27 (8.4%) patients experienced severe acute respiratory failure including 17 patients (63%) treated with HFNC as first-line therapy, 9 patients (33%) treated with noninvasive ventilation (NIV) and one patient (4%) treated with invasive ventilation.
32232685,HFNC failure was defined by the need of NIV or intubation as rescue therapy.
32232685,Of the 17 HFNC patients, 7 (41%) experienced HFNC failure.
32232685,The HFNC failure rate was 0% (0/6) in patients with PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> &gt; 200 mm Hg vs. 63% (7/11) in those with PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> ≤ 200 mm Hg (p = 0.04).
32232685,Compared with baseline data, the respiratory rate significantly decreased after 1-2 h of HFNC in successful group [median 26 (IQR: 25-29) vs. 23 (22-25), p = 0.03].
32232685,However, it did not in the unsuccessful group.
32232685,After initiation of NIV as rescue therapy among the 7 patients with HFNC failure, PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> significantly improved after 1-2 h of NIV [median 172 (150-208) mmHg vs.
32232685,114 (IQR: 79-130) under HFNC, p = 0.04].
32232685,However, two out of seven (29%) patients with NIV as rescue therapy ultimately received intubation.
32232685,Among the 27 patients with severe acute respiratory failure, four patients were eventually intubated (15%).
32232685,Our study indicated that HFNC was the most common ventilation support for patients with NCIP.
32232685,Patients with lower PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> were more likely to experience HFNC failure.
32233013,To figure out whether diabetes is a risk factor influencing the progression and prognosis of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
32233013,A total of 174 consecutive patients confirmed with COVID-19 were studied.
32233013,Demographic data, medical history, symptoms and signs, laboratory findings, chest computed tomography (CT) as well the treatment measures were collected and analysed.
32233013,We found that COVID-19 patients without other comorbidities but with diabetes (n = 24) were at higher risk of severe pneumonia, release of tissue injury-related enzymes, excessive uncontrolled inflammation responses and hypercoagulable state associated with dysregulation of glucose metabolism.
32233013,Furthermore, serum levels of inflammation-related biomarkers such as IL-6, C-reactive protein, serum ferritin and coagulation index, D-dimer, were significantly higher (P &lt; .01) in diabetic patients compared with those without, suggesting that patients with diabetes are more susceptible to an inflammatory storm eventually leading to rapid deterioration of COVID-19.
32233013,Our data support the notion that diabetes should be considered as a risk factor for a rapid progression and bad prognosis of COVID-19.
32233013,More intensive attention should be paid to patients with diabetes, in case of rapid deterioration.
32233018,A novel RNA betacoronavirus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) has now been declared pandemic disease by WHO.
32233018,Guo et al published the first report of biochemical features in patients with diabetes and the further risk that this disease can determine to the progression of Covid-19.
32233018,Among different cytokines found significantly higher in patients with diabetes compared to those without, Interleukin-6 (IL-6), which is already increased in conditions of chronic inflammation, may play a more deleterious role in Covid-19 infection.
32233018,Targeting the overexpression of Il-6 effects with a monoclonal antibody against IL-6 receptor or using Janus Kinase inhibitors may be particularly helpful for treatment of Covid-19 pneumonia in diabetes.
32233064,The current COVID-19 pandemic is challenging healthcare systems at a global level.
32233064,We provide a practical strategy to reorganize pathways of emergency and elective colorectal surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32233064,The authors, all from areas affected by the COVID-19 emergency, brainstormed remotely to define the key-points to be discussed.
32233064,Tasks were assigned, concerning specific aspects of colorectal surgery during the pandemic, including the administrative management of the crisis in Italy.
32233064,The recommendations (based on experience and on the limited evidence available) were collated and summarized.
32233064,Little is known about the transmission of COVID-19, but it has shown a rapid spread.
32233064,It is prudent to stop non-cancer procedures and prioritize urgent cancer treatment.
32233064,Endoscopy and proctological procedures should be performed highly selectively.
32233064,When dealing with colorectal emergencies, a conservative approach is advised.
32233064,Specific procedures should be followed when operating on COVID-19-patients, using dedicated personal protective equipment and adhering to specific rules.
32233064,Some policies are described, including minimally-invasive surgery.
32233064,These policies outline the strict regulation of entry/ exit into theatres and operating building as well as advice on performing procedures safely to reduce risk spreading the virus.
32233064,It is likely that a reorganization of health system is required, both at central and local levels.
32233064,A description of the strategy adopted in Italy is provided.
32233064,Evidence on the management of patients needing surgery for colorectal conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic is currently lacking.
32233064,Lessons learnt from healthcare professionals that have managed high volumes of surgical patients during the pandemic could be useful to mitigate some risks and reduce exposure to other patients, public and healthcare staff.
32233561,The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is running rampantly in China and is swiftly spreading to other countries in the world, which causes a great concern on the global public health.
32233561,The absence of specific therapeutic treatment or effective vaccine against COVID-19 call for other avenues of the prevention and control measures.
32233561,Media reporting is thought to be effective to curb the spreading of an emergency disease in the early stage.
32233561,Cross-correlation analysis based on our collected data demonstrated a strong correlation between media data and the infection case data.
32233561,Thus we proposed a deterministic dynamical model to examine the interaction of the disease progression and the media reports and to investigate the effectiveness of media reporting on mitigating the spread of COVID-19.
32233561,The basic reproduction number was estimated as 5.3167 through parameterization of the model with the number of cumulative confirmed cases, the number of cumulative deaths and the daily number of media items.
32233561,Sensitivity analysis suggested that, during the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak, enhancing the response rate of the media reporting to the severity of COVID-19, and enhancing the response rate of the public awareness to the media reports, both can bring forward the peak time and reduce the peak size of the infection significantly.
32233561,These findings suggested that besides improving the medical levels, media coverage can be considered as an effective way to mitigate the disease spreading during the initial stage of an outbreak.
32233563,The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan and other cities of China is a growing global concern.
32233563,Delay in diagnosis and limited hospital resources lead to a rapid spread of COVID-19.
32233563,In this study, we investigate the effect of delay in diagnosis on the disease transmission with a new formulated dynamic model.
32233563,Sensitivity analyses and numerical simulations reveal that, improving the proportion of timely diagnosis and shortening the waiting time for diagnosis can not eliminate COVID-19 but can effectively decrease the basic reproduction number, significantly reduce the transmission risk, and effectively prevent the endemic of COVID-19, e.g., shorten the peak time and reduce the peak value of new confirmed cases and new infection, decrease the cumulative number of confirmed cases and total infection.
32233563,More rigorous prevention measures and better treatment of patients are needed to control its further spread, e.g., increasing available hospital beds, shortening the period from symptom onset to isolation of patients, quarantining and isolating the suspected cases as well as all confirmed patients.
32233641,The novel coronavirus named COVID-19, which originated in Wuhan, China, has spread to many countries around the world.
32233641,Currently, no effective medical treatment exists to combat this disease.
32233641,Traditional Chinese herbal medicines (CHM) have unique roles in the treatment of viral infections.
32233641,In this article we analyzed the effectiveness and possible molecular mechanisms of CHM formulas for the prevention of COVID-19.
32233641,The active ingredients and action targets of CHM formulas were obtained from the TCMSP database.
32233641,Genes related to severe acute respiratory syndromes (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) were queried on the GeneCards database.
32233641,The action mechanisms of these genes were predicted using a Gene Ontology (GO)-based functional enrichment and annotation tool and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG).
32233641,CHM formulas played a positive role in preventing COVID-19 and warrant further application.
32233641,Our research provides new evidence to support the possible value of CHM formulas for the prevention of COVID-19.
32233641,However, further clinical studies with large sample sizes are required to verify their effectiveness.
32233642,The emerging infection of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in late December, 2019 in Wuhan, China, has caused an extreme health concern, with many patients having progressed to acute respiratory disease or other complications in a short period.
32233642,Meanwhile, the risk factors associated with the disease progression still remain elusive.
32233642,A cohort of 17 patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infections who were admitted to the Ninth Hospital of Nanchang between January 28 and February 6, 2020, were enrolled in this study.
32233642,All the patients received standardized treatment.
32233642,The disease progression was evaluated every 7 days after admission.
32233642,The clinical, radiologic, and laboratory characteristics were retrospectively analyzed, and the factors associated with the disease progression were screened by binary logistic regression analysis.
32233642,The cohort comprised 11 women (64.7%) and 6 men (35.3%) between the ages of 18 to 70 years old.
32233642,All patients had a reported history of contact with infection-confirmed patients.
32233642,Fever (11/64.7%) and cough (8/47.1%) were the most common symptoms, whereas dyspnea (2/11.8%) and fatigue (3/17.6%) were rare, and there was no patient with diarrhea symptoms.
32233642,There were 5 patients with aggravated disease at the first disease progression evaluation, and no patient received mechanical ventilation, transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU), or progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, refractory metabolic acidosis, coagulation dysfunction, or death.
32233642,Based on the disease progression, patients were divided into the non-aggravation group (12 cases) and the aggravation group (5 cases).
32233642,There were no significant differences between the 2 groups with respect to their clinical characteristics.
32233642,Chest computed tomography (CT) on admission revealed there were 8 patients (47.1%) with invasive lesions found bilaterally on the lungs on multiple lobes, 4 patients (23.5%) with invasive lesions on 1 lobe, and 5 patients (29.4%) with normal chest CT.
32233642,The aggravation group had1 patient (20.0%) with invasive lesions on one lobe, 3 (60.0%) with invasive lesions on multiple lobes, bilaterally, and 1 (20.0%) with normal chest CT; meanwhile, the nonaggravation group had 3 patients (25.0%) with invasive lesions on one lobe, 5 (41.7%) with invasive lesions on multiple lobes, bilaterally, and 4 (33.3%) with normal chest CT.
32233642,No significant difference was found between the 2 groups.
32233642,In the aggravation group, the total lymphocyte counts significantly decreased in comparison to that in the non-aggravation group.
32233642,Further analysis showed that the CD4+ T cell count but not the CD8+ T cell count of the aggravation group was significantly lower than that of the non-aggravation group.
32233642,Correlation analysis indicated total lymphocyte count was positively correlated with CD4+ T cell count, and no significant differences were found between the 2 groups in other laboratory measurements, including those of white blood cell (WBC) count, C-reactive protein (CRP), albumin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and D-dimer.
32233642,Finally, a binary logistic regression model was used to identify the factors associated with the disease progression.
32233642,It was found that total lymphocyte count was a risk factor associated with disease progression in patients infected with 2019-nCoV.
32233642,A higher cell count of total lymphocytes may indicate a better outcome of the disease, and immune response may be a vital factor for directing disease progression in the early stage of 2019-nCoV infection.
32233816,<b>Introduction:</b> Novel coronavirus or coronavirus disease (COVID-19) can affect all age groups.
32233816,The clinical course of the disease in children and infants is milder than in adults.
32233816,It should be noted that, although typical symptoms may be present in children, non-specific symptoms could be noted in the neonate.
32233816,The disease is rare in the neonate, so, its suspicion in this group can help to make a quick diagnose.<b>Case report:</b> A 15-day-old neonate was admitted with fever, lethargy, cutaneous mottling, and respiratory distress without cough.
32233816,His mother had symptoms of Novel coronavirus.
32233816,So Reverse-Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) assay was done for the neonate and showed to be positive.
32233816,The newborn was isolated and subjected to supportive care.
32233816,Antibiotic and antiviral treatment was initiated.
32233816,Eventually, the baby was discharged in good general condition.<b>Conclusion:</b> When a newborn presents with non-specific symptoms of infection with an added history of COVID-19 in his/her parents, it indicates the need for PCR testing for Novel coronavirus.
32233973,<i>Satisfactory outcome was observed in one mild case and one severe case of COVID-19 pneumonia after the use of the online/offline multidisciplinary quarantine observation form, online monitoring, and classified diagnosis and treatment, as well as strict compliance with quarantine measures.
32233973,Conditions of both patients were improved, and cross-infection and disease onset clustering were not observed.
32233973,The multidisciplinary self-quarantine model provides early judgment, identification, and treatment of disease, improves compliance with early rehabilitation, increases confidence in recovery, and enhances self-management capabilities.
32233973,This model is applicable to the current novel coronavirus pneumonia epidemic and can actively promote the management of suspected or confirmed mild cases, monitoring of critical cases, and self-management of discharged patients.
32233973,The application of this new management model is worthy of being promoted in our specialized treatment facilities and in countries with severe epidemics.</i>
32234126,The diagnosis of COVID-19 is based on the positive of etiological test.
32234126,The current etiological test of COVID-19 cost long time, and have high false negative rate, may resulting delay the measures of disease treatment and prevention.
32234126,We suggested that COVID-19 should be diagnosed as 3 types: suspected case, clinical diagnosed case, and definite diagnosed case.
32234126,新型冠状病毒肺炎的诊断是以病原学检测阳性为确诊标准的，由于现有的病原学检测耗时较长，假阴性率较高，致使疑似病例的确诊时间延长，从而延误后续防治。
32234126,本文建议将该病的诊断标准分为疑似病例、临床诊断病例和确诊病例3类。.
32234131,<b>Objective:</b> To explore imaging characteristics of children with 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection. <b>Methods:</b> A retrospective analysis was performed on clinical data and chest CT images of 15 children diagnosed with 2019-nCoV infection.
32234131,They were admitted to the Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen from January 16 to February 6, 2020.
32234131,The distribution and morphology of pulmonary lesions on chest CT images were analyzed. <b>Results:</b> Among the 15 children, 5 were males and 10 females, aged from 4 to 14 years.
32234131,Five of the 15 children were febrile and 10 were asymptomatic on the first visit.
32234131,The first nasal or pharyngeal swab samples in all the 15 cases were positive for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid.
32234131,For their first chest CT images, 6 patients had no lesions, while 9 patients had pulmonary inflammatory lesions.
32234131,Seven cases had small nodular ground glass opacities and 2 cases had speckled ground glass opacities.
32234131,After 3 to 5 days of treatment, 2019-nCoV nucleic acid in a second respiratory sample turned negative in 6 cases.
32234131,Among them, chest CT images showed less lesions in 2 cases, no lesion in 3 cases, and no improvement in 1 case.
32234131,The remaining 9 cases were still positive in a second nucleic acid test.
32234131,Six patients showed similar chest CT inflammation, while 3 patients had new lesions, which were all small nodular ground glass opacities. <b>Conclusions:</b> The early chest CT images of children with 2019-nCoV infection are mostly small nodular ground glass opacities.
32234131,The clinical symptoms of children with 2019-nCoV infection are nonspecific.
32234131,Dynamic reexamination of chest CT and nucleic acid are important. <b>目的：</b> 探讨儿童2019新型冠状病毒感染的CT影像学特征。
32234131,<b>方法：</b> 回顾性分析2020年1月16日至2月6日深圳市第三人民医院收治的15例2019新型冠状病毒感染患儿的临床资料及胸部CT影像资料。
32234131,分析2019新型冠状病毒感染患儿CT影像肺部病变分布位置、病变形态等特征。
32234131,<b>结果：</b> 15例患儿中男5例、女10例，年龄4~14岁，其中初诊发热者5例、无症状者10例；鼻拭子或咽拭子病毒核酸初诊检测均阳性。
32234131,初诊胸部CT影像，6例未见病变；9例显示肺部炎症，其中小结节磨玻璃影7例、斑片磨玻璃影2例。
32234131,治疗3~5 d复查，病毒核酸转阴6例，其中2例患儿胸部CT炎症较前吸收减少，3例患儿胸部CT仍未见病灶，1例无明显变化；病毒核酸仍阳性者9例，其中6例胸部CT炎症表现无明显变化，3例复查胸部CT新见炎症，均表现为小结节磨玻璃影。
32234131,<b>结论：</b> 儿童感染2019新型冠状病毒临床症状不典型，其早期影像学多表现为小结节状磨玻璃影。
32234131,对于儿童2019新型冠状病毒感染胸部CT及病毒核酸动态复查很重要。.
32234464,The impact of communicable diseases (infectious diseases) on human health is obvious.
32234464,The sudden outbreak of COVID-19 (Corona Virus Disease 2019) has made people realise the threat of communicable diseases to mankind.
32234464,As a city of many migrants, Zhuhai Special Economic Zone experienced great challenges brought about by the COVID-19 epidemic.
32234464,Experience has been acquired from all aspects of this.
32234464,A highly reactive, multifunctional and efficient emergency management system should be established, and the significance of information communication should be fully understood for the future.
32234465,Viral respiratory diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) always pose a severe threat to people.
32234465,First identified in late December 2019, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV; SARS-CoV-2) has affected many provinces in China and multiple countries worldwide.
32234465,The viral outbreak has aroused panic and a public-health emergency around the world, and the number of infections continues to rise.
32234465,However, the causes and consequences of the pneumonia remain unknown.
32234465,To effectively implement epidemic prevention, early identification and diagnosis are critical to disease control.
32234465,Here we scrutinise a series of available studies by global scientists on the clinical manifestations, detection methods and treatment options for the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and also propose potential strategies for preventing the infection.
32234466,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) originated in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, Central China, and has spread quickly to 72 countries to date.
32234466,COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [previously provisionally known as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)].
32234466,At present, the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 has caused a large number of deaths with tens of thousands of confirmed cases worldwide, posing a serious threat to public health.
32234466,However, there are no clinically approved vaccines or specific therapeutic drugs available for COVID-19.
32234466,Intensive research on the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 is urgently needed to elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms and epidemiological characteristics and to identify potential drug targets, which will contribute to the development of effective prevention and treatment strategies.
32234466,Hence, this review will focus on recent progress regarding the structure of SARS-CoV-2 and the characteristics of COVID-19, such as the aetiology, pathogenesis and epidemiological characteristics.
32234467,Since December 2019, a viral pneumonia (COVID-19) from Wuhan, China has swept the world.
32234467,Although the case fatality rate is not high, the number of people infected is large, and there are still a large number of patients dying.
32234467,With the collation and publication of more and more clinical data, a large number of data suggest that there are mild or severe cytokine storms in severe patients, which is also an important cause of death.
32234467,Therefore, the treatment of cytokine storm has become an important part of rescuing severe patients.
32234467,Interleukin-6 (IL-6) plays an important role in cytokine release syndrome (CRS).
32234467,If it can block the signal transduction pathway of IL-6, it is expected to become a new method for the treatment of severe patients.
32234467,Tocilizumab is a blocker of IL-6R, which can effectively block IL-6 signal transduction pathway.
32234467,So, tocilizumab is likely to become an effective drug for patients with severe COVID-19.
32234468,In December 2019, the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China spread worldwide, becoming an emergency of major international concern.
32234468,SARS-CoV-2 infection causes clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus.
32234468,Human-to-human transmission via droplets, contaminated hands or surfaces has been described, with incubation times of 2-14 days.
32234468,Early diagnosis, quarantine, and supportive treatments are essential to cure patients.
32234468,This paper reviews the literature on all available information about the epidemiology, diagnosis, isolation and treatments of COVID-19.
32234468,Treatments, including antiviral agents, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, corticosteroids, antibodies, convalescent plasma transfusion and vaccines, are discussed in this article.
32234468,In addition, registered trials investigating treatment options for COVID-19 infection are listed.
32234728,Every month, DTB scans sources of information on treatments, disease management and other healthcare topics for key items to bring to our readers' attention and help them keep up to date.
32234728,To do this, we produce succinct, contextualised summaries of the information concerned.
32235161,With the current COVID-19 pandemic, concerns have been raised about the risk to children with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD).
32235161,We aimed to collate global experience and provide provisional guidance for managing paediatric IBD (PIBD) in the era of COVID-19.
32235161,An electronic reporting system of children with IBD infected with SARS-CoV-2 has been circulated among 102 PIBD centres affiliated with the Porto and Interest-group of ESPGHAN.
32235161,A survey has been completed by major PIBD centres in China and South-Korea to explore management during the pandemic.
32235161,A third survey collected current practice of PIBD treatment.
32235161,Finally guidance points for practice have been formulated and voted upon by 37 PIBD authors and Porto group members.
32235161,Eight PIBD children had COVID-19 globally, all with mild infection without needing hospitalization despite treatment with immunomodulators and/or biologics.
32235161,No cases have been reported in China and South Korea but biologic treatment has been delayed in 79 children, of whom 17 (22%) had exacerbation of their IBD.
32235161,Among the Porto group members, face-to-face appointments were often replaced by remote consultations but almost all did not change current IBD treatment.
32235161,Ten guidance points for clinicians caring for PIBD patients in epidemic areas have been endorsed with consensus rate of 92-100%.
32235161,Preliminary data for PIBD patients during COVID-19 outbreak are reassuring.
32235161,Standard IBD treatments including biologics should continue at present through the pandemic, especially in children who generally have more severe IBD course on one hand, and milder SARS-CoV-2 infection on the other.
32235486,A growing body of literature on the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is becoming available, but a synthesis of available data has not been conducted.
32235486,We performed a scoping review of currently available clinical, epidemiological, laboratory, and chest imaging data related to the SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32235486,We searched MEDLINE, Cochrane CENTRAL, EMBASE, Scopus and LILACS from 01 January 2019 to 24 February 2020.
32235486,Study selection, data extraction and risk of bias assessment were performed by two independent reviewers.
32235486,Qualitative synthesis and meta-analysis were conducted using the clinical and laboratory data, and random-effects models were applied to estimate pooled results.
32235486,A total of 61 studies were included (59,254 patients).
32235486,The most common disease-related symptoms were fever (82%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 56%-99%; <i>n</i> = 4410), cough (61%, 95% CI 39%-81%; <i>n</i> = 3985), muscle aches and/or fatigue (36%, 95% CI 18%-55%; <i>n</i> = 3778), dyspnea (26%, 95% CI 12%-41%; <i>n</i> = 3700), headache in 12% (95% CI 4%-23%, <i>n</i> = 3598 patients), sore throat in 10% (95% CI 5%-17%, <i>n</i> = 1387) and gastrointestinal symptoms in 9% (95% CI 3%-17%, <i>n</i> = 1744).
32235486,Laboratory findings were described in a lower number of patients and revealed lymphopenia (0.93 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L, 95% CI 0.83-1.03 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L, <i>n</i> = 464) and abnormal C-reactive protein (33.72 mg/dL, 95% CI 21.54-45.91 mg/dL; <i>n</i> = 1637).
32235486,Radiological findings varied, but mostly described ground-glass opacities and consolidation.
32235486,Data on treatment options were limited.
32235486,All-cause mortality was 0.3% (95% CI 0.0%-1.0%; <i>n</i> = 53,631).
32235486,Epidemiological studies showed that mortality was higher in males and elderly patients.
32235486,The majority of reported clinical symptoms and laboratory findings related to SARS-CoV-2 infection are non-specific.
32235486,Clinical suspicion, accompanied by a relevant epidemiological history, should be followed by early imaging and virological assay.
32235575,The recent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, previously known as 2019-nCoV) outbreak has engulfed an unprepared world amidst a festive season.
32235575,The zoonotic SARS-CoV-2, believed to have originated from infected bats, is the seventh member of enveloped RNA coronavirus.
32235575,Specifically, the overall genome sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 is 96.2% identical to that of bat coronavirus termed BatCoV RaTG13.
32235575,Although the current mortality rate of 2% is significantly lower than that of SARS (9.6%) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) (35%), SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and transmissible from human to human with an incubation period of up to 24 days.
32235575,Some statistical studies have shown that, on average, one infected patient may lead to a subsequent 5.7 confirmed cases.
32235575,Since the first reported case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the SARS-CoV-2 on December 1, 2019, in Wuhan, China, there has been a total of 60,412 confirmed cases with 1370 fatalities reported in 25 different countries as of February 13, 2020.
32235575,The outbreak has led to severe impacts on social health and the economy at various levels.
32235575,This paper is a review of the significant, continuous global effort that was made to respond to the outbreak in the first 75 days.
32235575,Although no vaccines have been discovered yet, a series of containment measures have been implemented by various governments, especially in China, in the effort to prevent further outbreak, whilst various medical treatment approaches have been used to successfully treat infected patients.
32235575,On the basis of current studies, it would appear that the combined antiviral treatment has shown the highest success rate.
32235575,This review aims to critically summarize the most recent advances in understanding the coronavirus, as well as the strategies in prevention and treatment.
32236089,Respiratory physiotherapy in patients with COVID-19 infection in acute setting: a Position Paper of the Italian Association of Respiratory Physiotherapists (ARIR) On February 2020, Italy, especially the northern regions, was hit by an epidemic of the new SARS-Cov-2 coronavirus that spread from China between December 2019 and January 2020.
32236089,The entire healthcare system had to respond promptly in a very short time to an exponential growth of the number of subjects affected by COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) with the need of semi-intensive and intensive care units.
32236624,The new outbreak of coronavirus from December 2019 has brought attention to an old viral enemy and has raised concerns as to the ability of current protection measures and the healthcare system to handle such a threat.
32236624,It has been known since the 1960s that coronaviruses can cause respiratory infections in humans; however, their epidemic potential was understood only during the past two decades.
32236624,In the present review, we address current knowledge on coronaviruses from a short history to epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestation of the disease, as well as treatment and prevention strategies.
32236624,Although a great amount of research and efforts have been made worldwide to prevent further outbreaks of coronavirus‑associated disease, the spread and lethality of the 2019 outbreak (COVID‑19) is proving to be higher than previous epidemics on account of international travel density and immune naivety of the population.
32236624,Only strong, joint and coordinated efforts of worldwide healthcare systems, researchers, and pharmaceutical companies and receptive national leaders will succeed in suppressing an outbreak of this scale.
32236983,The Covid-19 pandemic has already affected many thousands of people and has become the greatest health challenge worldwide [1].
32236983,The range of clinical presentations varies from asymptomatic and mild clinical symptoms to acute respiratory-distress syndrome (ARDS) and death.
32236983,Due to the unknown number of asymptomatic viral-shedding and pauci-symptomatic people in the community, the total number of infections is uncertain.
32236983,As yet, effective treatment is unavailable.
32236983,However, the results of preliminary studies and clinical trials are improving our understanding of the pathogenesis and treatment of Covid-19.
32236983,Herein, we share our personal opinions on the immunopathogenesis of this infection.
32237160,The rapid spread of the epidemic has aroused widespread concern in the international community.
32237160,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) originated from Wuhan's Huanan wholesale seafood market, with bats as the likely original hosts and pangolins as potential intermediate hosts.
32237160,The current source of the disease is mainly patients infected with SARS-COV-2.
32237160,Patients in the incubation period may also become sources of infection.
32237160,The virus is mainly transmitted via respiratory droplets and contact, and the population is generally susceptible.
32237160,The epidemic has progressed through the local outbreak stage and community transmission stage due to exposure at Wuhan's Huanan wholesale seafood market and is now in the stage of large-scale transmission due to the spread of the epidemic.
32237160,The basic productive number (R0) at the beginning of the epidemic was 2.2, with an average incubation period of 5.2 days.
32237160,The proportion of critically ill patients was 23.4%, the mortality rate was lower than those of SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome, and 96.5% of deaths occurred in Hubei Province, where the outbreak occurred first.
32237160,Among them, elderly men with underlying diseases had a higher mortality rate.
32237160,Chinese medical staff have summarized a set of effective strategies and methods in the diagnosis and treatment of this disease that are worthy of reference for their international counterparts.
32237160,With powerful government intervention and the efforts of Chinese medical staff, China's outbreak has gradually improved.
32237206,A recent JAMA viewpoint regarding fatalities In Italy associated with the COVID-19 pandemic failed to mention obesity as one of the pre-existing diseases associated with death.<sup>1</sup> It seems likely that the increased prevalence of obesity in Italy older adults compared to China may account for the differences in mortality between the two countries.
32237206,Furthermore, the rising prevalence of obesity in the US and prior experience of the impact of obesity on mortality from H<sub>1</sub> N<sub>1</sub> Influenza should increase the sensitivity of clinicians caring for patients with obesity and COVID-19 to the need for aggressive treatment of such patients.
32237998,<b>Objectives:</b> The COVID-19 outbreak is a serious threat to public health and social distancing on the part of individuals can help contain the epidemic.
32237998,It is unknown if dermatologists are assisting with the public health officials' recommendations for social distancing by closing their practice or limiting their practice to the treatment of emergency conditions.
32237998,This study examines the activity level of dermatology practices during the United States COVID-19 outbreak.<b>Methods:</b> We performed scripted phone calls to 60 dermatology practices in six different counties in the United Stated during the COVID-19 outbreak.
32237998,We assessed if practices are open and if they are serving patients with urgent and non-urgent conditions.<b>Results:</b> Of the 60 dermatologists selected for the study, 55 were successfully contacted (92% contact rate).
32237998,Of these practices, 29 (53%) were open, 17 (31%) were only seeing urgent patients and 9 (16%) were closed.
32237998,New York, New York had 2 (20%) open offices which was the lowest proportion of any county (<i>p</i> = .04).
32237998,Counties with higher prevalence had fewer open offices (<i>p</i> &lt; .01, <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = .7).<b>Conclusions:</b> Many practices have restricted their level of operation especially in higher areas of COVID-19 prevalence, likely to help facilitate social distancing.
32238232,COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by 2019-nCoV and characterizes as an atypical pneumonia.
32238232,Since 2019-nCoV is a newly emerging virus, the pathogenesis of COVID-19 is not well known.
32238232,Most patients had a self-limited course, and some became severe even death.
32238232,In this review, the authors compared two coronavirus outbreaks during the past two decades: the SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV.
32238232,Among the biological nature of the pathogens, viral receptor distribution on the human cells, and the pathological findings in the targeted organs and clinical features of the patients with the diseases, found similarities and differences between the two diseases.
32238232,Due to the shared receptor ACE2 and the pathological similarities of the SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV diseases.
32238232,They proposed a pathogenesis model for COVID-19.
32238232,Like the SARS-CoV disease, COVID-19 is a systematic disease and targets the lungs, vasculatures, and the immune system.
32238232,The basic pathogenesis involves two interlinked processes: a severe lung inflammation and immune deficiency, both of which are related to an inappropriate immune response and over-production of cytokines.
32238232,Thus, treatment approaches should include antiviral and anti-proinflammatory cytokines, anti-infectious and life support therapies, especially in patients with severe diseases.
32238232,新型冠状病毒感染疾病（COVID-19）是一种由人类新型冠状病毒（2019-nCoV）引起的传染病，基本特征以肺部炎性病变为主。
32238232,目前正在全球迅速蔓延。
32238232,该文比较近二十年间发生的两次人类冠状病毒严重急性呼吸综合征（SARS）和COVID-19肺炎的病原特点、受体分布、临床表现和病理改变，试图揭示COVID-19的病理生理机制，为治疗患者和疫情管控提供新思路。
32238232,分析表明，由于2019-nCoV和SARS冠状病变在人体细胞上有相同的受体(ACE2)，因而它们可能有相同的靶器官，如肺、心血管系统和免疫系统。
32238232,病理改变除了病毒直接损伤靶器官中的功能细胞外，还与病毒诱导靶细胞产生促炎因子造成局部严重炎性反应有关。
32238232,同时，促炎因子还过度激活了免疫细胞尤其是单核-巨噬细胞和T细胞，产生大量细胞因子形成细胞因子风暴（cytokine storm）。
32238232,过量的细胞因子不但加剧了靶器官的炎性反应，还引起T细胞凋亡和免疫功能失调，造成免疫缺陷而不能有效清除病毒并造成继发感染。
32238232,因此，在重症患者的管理上，除了生命支持及抗感染治疗外，有效控制肺部炎性反应和系统性拮抗细胞因子风暴可能有助于纠正缺氧，避免多器官衰竭乃至死亡。.
32238260,The impact caused by the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in different parts of the world, currently reaches 745, 308 infected and 35,307 deaths according to the latest reports.
32238260,In this context, in our country, an area of ​​epidemiological relevance is the Peruvian Amazon, due to the distribution of endemic diseases such as metaxemic diseases (Dengue, Malaria, among others), where the problem increases due to the COVID infection. -19 can lead to false positives in Dengue screening tests.
32238260,Thus leading to a delay in the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection and further spread of the virus, since in most cases of Dengue there are no warning signs and treatment is ambulatory.
32238260,This article seeks to express an opinion on the need to address cases of coinfection between Dengue and Covid-19 in endemic areas.
32238260,El impacto que ha originado la enfermedad por coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) en diferentes partes del mundo, alcanza en la actualidad 597, 072 personas contagiadas y 27,364 fallecidas según los últimos reportes.
32238260,En ese contexto, en nuestro país, una zona de relevancia epidemiológica es la amazonia peruana, debido a la distribución de enfermedades endémicas como las enfermedades metaxénicas (Dengue, Malaria entre otras), en donde el problema se incrementa debido a que la infección por COVID-19 puede llevar a falsos positivos en las pruebas de cribado para Dengue.
32238260,Conllevando de esa forma a un retraso en el diagnóstico de la infección por COVID-19 y una mayor diseminación del virus, debido a que en la mayor parte de los casos de Dengue no se presentan signos de alarma y el tratamiento es ambulatorio.
32238260,Este artículo busca emitir una opinión sobre la necesidad del abordaje de casos de coinfección entre Dengue y Covid-19 en zonas endémicas.
32238438,COVID19 is a devastating global pandemic with epicenters in China, Italy, Spain, and now the United States.
32238438,While the majority of infected cases appear mild, in some cases individuals present serious cardiorespiratory complications with possible long-term lung damage.
32238438,Infected individuals report a range of symptoms from headaches to shortness of breath to taste and smell loss.
32238438,To that end, less is known about the how the virus may impact different organ systems.
32238438,The SARS-CoV2 virus, which is responsible for COVID19, is highly similar to SARS-CoV.
32238438,Both viruses have evolved an ability to enter host cells through direct interaction with the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein at the surface of many cells.
32238438,Published findings indicate that SARS-CoV can enter the human nervous system with evidence from both postmortem brains and detection in cerebrospinal fluid of infected individuals.
32238438,Here we consider the ability of SARS-CoV2 to enter and infect the human nervous system based on the strong expression of the ACE2 target throughout the brain.
32238438,Moreover, we predict that nicotine exposure through various kinds of smoking (cigarettes, e-cigarettes, or vape) can increase the risk for COVID19 neuroinfection based on known functional interactions between the nicotinic receptor and ACE2.
32238438,We advocate for higher surveillance and analysis of neuro-complications in infected cases.
32238504,Neurologists are used to uncertainty - diagnoses are frequently challenging, too often there are limited treatment options, and unpredictable prognoses are our bread and butter.
32238504,When colleagues struggle to communicate bad news, they regularly turn to us.
32238504,We practice staying steady and calm amidst our patients' fears, confusion, suffering, and anxiety.
32238504,We listen, perform detailed exams, and do our best to provide helpful insights.
32238504,This emphasis on listening and thoughtful problem solving is the core of our art and should be front and center as we partner with colleagues to face an unprecedented set of challenges related to the Covid-19 pandemic.
32238613,The 2019-novel coronavirus predominantly affects the respiratory system with manifestations ranging from upper respiratory symptoms to full blown acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
32238613,It is important to recognize the risk factors, categorize severity and provide early treatment.
32238613,Use of high flow devices and non-invasive ventilation has been discouraged due to high chances of aerosol generation.
32238613,Early intubation and mechanical ventilation areessential to prevent complications and worsening, especially in resource-limited settings with very few centers having expertise to manage critical cases.
32238613,Hydrophobic viral filter in the ventilator circuit minimizes chances of transmission of virus.
32238613,Strategies to manage ARDS in COVID-19 include low tidal volume ventilation with liberal sedation-analgesia.
32238613,At the same time, prevention of transmission of the virus to healthcare workers is extremely important in the intensive care setting dealing with severe cases and requiring procedures generating aerosol.
32238613,We, herein, provide guidance on non-invasive respiratory support, intubation and management of ARDS in a child with COVID-19.
32238757,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which causes serious respiratory illness such as pneumonia and lung failure, was first reported in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei, China.
32238757,The etiological agent of COVID-19 has been confirmed as a novel coronavirus, now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is most likely originated from zoonotic coronaviruses, like SARS-CoV, which emerged in 2002.
32238757,Within a few months of the first report, SARS-CoV-2 had spread across China and worldwide, reaching a pandemic level.
32238757,As COVID-19 has triggered enormous human casualties and serious economic loss posing global threat, an understanding of the ongoing situation and the development of strategies to contain the virus's spread are urgently needed.
32238757,Currently, various diagnostic kits to test for COVID-19 are available and several repurposing therapeutics for COVID-19 have shown to be clinically effective.
32238757,In addition, global institutions and companies have begun to develop vaccines for the prevention of COVID-19.
32238757,Here, we review the current status of epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, and vaccine development for COVID-19.
32239127,In December, 2019, a series of pneumonia cases of unknown cause emerged in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
32239127,In this study, we investigate clinical and laboratory features and short-term outcomes of patients with Corona Virus Disease 2019(COVID-19).
32239127,All patients with COVID-19 admitted to Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital in Wuhan, China, between January 3 and February 1, 2020 were included.
32239127,All those patients were with laboratory-confirmed infection.
32239127,Epidemiological, clinical, radiological characteristics, underlying diseases, laboratory tests treatment, complications and outcomes data were collected.
32239127,Outcomes were followed up at discharge until Feb 15, 2020.
32239127,The study cohort included 102 adult patients.
32239127,The median (IQR) age was 54 years (37-67years) and 48.0% were female.
32239127,A total of 34 patients (33.3%) were exposed to source of transmission in the hospital setting (as health care workers, patients, or visitors) and 10 patients (9.8%) had a familial cluster.
32239127,Eighteen patients (17.6%) were admitted to the ICU, and 17 patients died (mortality, 16.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 9.4%-23.9%).
32239127,Among patients who survived, they were younger, more likely were health care workers and less likely suffered from comorbidities.
32239127,They were also less likely suffered from complications.
32239127,There was no difference in drug treatment rates between the survival and non-survival groups.
32239127,Patients who survived less likely required admission to the intensive care unit (14.1% vs.
32239127,35.3%).
32239127,Chest imaging examination showed that death patients more likely had ground-glass opacity (41.2% vs.
32239127,12.9%).
32239127,The mortality rate was high among the COVID-19 patients described in our cohort who met our criteria for inclusion in this analysis.
32239127,Patient characteristics seen more frequently in those who died were development of systemic complications following onset of the illness and the severity of disease requiring admission to the ICU.
32239127,Our data support those described by others that COVID-19 infection results from human-to-human transmission, including familial clustering of cases, and nosocomial transmission.
32239127,There were no differences in mortality among those who did or did not receive antimicrobial or glucocorticoid drug treatment.
32239142,Since December 2019, the newly identified coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has caused a massive health crisis worldwide and resulted in over 70,000 COVID-19 infections so far.
32239142,Clinical drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2 are urgently needed to decrease the high fatality rate of confirmed COVID-19 patients.
32239142,Traditional de novo drug discovery needs more than 10 years, so drug repurposing seems the best option currently to find potential drugs for treating COVID-19.
32239142,Compared with traditional non-covalent drugs, covalent drugs have attracted escalating attention recent years due to their advantages in potential specificity upon careful design, efficiency, and patient burden.
32239142,We recently developed a computational protocol named as SCAR for discovering covalent drugs.
32239142,In this work, we used the SCAR protocol to identify possible covalent drugs (approved or clinically tested) targeting the main protease (3CLpro) of SARS-CoV-2.
32239142,We identified 11 potential hits, among which at least 6 hits were exclusively enriched by the SCAR protocol.
32239142,Since the preclinical or clinical information of these identified drugs is already available, they might be ready for being clinically tested in the treatment of COVID-19.
32239799,Coagulopathy in corona virus infection has been shown to be associated with high mortality with high D-dimers being a particularly important marker for the coagulopathy.<sup>1</sup> In the latest paper from the same group, the use of anticoagulant therapy with heparin was shown to decrease mortality as well. <sup>2</sup> This is especially so in patients i) who have met the sepsis induced coagulopathy (SIC) criteria ≥4 (40.0% vs 64.2%, P=0.029) compared to those with SIC score &lt;4 (29.0% vs 22.6%, P=0.419).or ii) with markedly elevated D-dimer (greater than six-fold at the upper limit of normal).
32240303,Emergent policy changes related to telemedicine and the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) during the novel coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) have created opportunities for technology-based clinical evaluation, which serves to conserve personal protective equipment (PPE) and protect emergency providers.
32240303,We define electronic personal protective equipment (ePPE) as an approach using telemedicine tools to perform electronic medical screening exams while satisfying EMTALA.
32240303,We discuss the safety, legal, and technical factors necessary for implementing such a pathway.
32240303,This approach has the potential to conserve PPE and protect providers while maintaining safe standards for medical screening exams in the ED for low risk patients in whom COVID-19 is suspected.
32240462,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has posed a significant threat to global health.
32240462,It caused a total of 80 868 confirmed cases and 3101 deaths in Chinese mainland until March 8, 2020.
32240462,This novel virus spread mainly through respiratory droplets and close contact.
32240462,As disease progressed, a series of complications tend to develop, especially in critically ill patients.
32240462,Pathological findings showed representative features of acute respiratory distress syndrome and involvement of multiple organs.
32240462,Apart from supportive care, no specific treatment has been established for COVID-19.
32240462,The efficacy of some promising antivirals, convalescent plasma transfusion, and tocilizumab needs to be investigated by ongoing clinical trials.
32240545,Plasma provided by COVID-19 convalescent patients may provide therapeutic relief as the number CODID-19 cases escalate steeply world-wide.
32240545,Prior findings in various viral respiratory diseases including SARS-CoV related pneumonia suggest that convalescent plasma can reduce mortality, although formal proof of efficacy is still lacking.
32240545,By reducing viral spread early on, such an approach may possibly downplay subsequent immunopathology.
32240545,Identifying, collecting, qualifying and preparing plasma from convalescent patients with adequate SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing Ab titers in an acute crisis setting may be challenging, although well within the remit of most blood establishments.
32240545,Careful clinical evaluation should allow to quickly establish whether such passive immunotherapy, administered at early phases of the disease in patients at high risk of deleterious evolution may reduce the frequency of patient deterioration, and thereby COVID-19 mortality.
32240567,The rapid spread of COVID-19 epidemic in Italy, in particular in the Milan focal point, required drastic measures and led to panic in the population.
32240567,While in our centre we did not change our approach to the treatment of our young cancer patients, we developed a qualitative survey to assess their perception of the risk and level of stress.
32240567,The survey showed that a relatively large proportion of them felt personally at risk of severe complications.
32240567,We believe that we need to adequately inform our patients, focusing on hygienic measures and personal protection and prompt reporting of any suspicious symptoms.

32240670,To investigate the characteristics and prognostic factors in the elderly patients with COVID-19.
32240670,Consecutive cases over 60 years old with COVID-19 in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from Jan 1 to Feb 6, 2020 were included.
32240670,The primary outcomes were death and survival till March 5.
32240670,Data of demographics, clinical features, comorbidities, laboratory tests and complications were collected and compared for different outcomes.
32240670,Cox regression was performed for prognostic factors. 339 patients with COVID-19 (aged 71±8 years,173 females (51%)) were enrolled, including 80 (23.6%) critical, 159 severe (46.9%) and 100 moderate (29.5%) cases.
32240670,Common comorbidities were hypertension (40.8%), diabetes (16.0%) and cardiovascular disease (15.7%).
32240670,Common symptoms included fever (92.0%), cough (53.0%), dyspnea (40.8%) and fatigue (39.9%).
32240670,Lymphocytopenia was a common laboratory finding (63.2%).
32240670,Common complications included bacterial infection (42.8%), liver enzyme abnormalities (28.7%) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (21.0%).
32240670,Till Mar 5, 2020, 91 cases were discharged (26.8%), 183 cases stayed in hospital (54.0%) and 65 cases (19.2%) were dead.
32240670,Shorter length of stay was found for the dead compared with the survivors (5 (3-8) vs.
32240670,28 (26-29), P &lt; 0.001).
32240670,Symptoms of dyspnea (HR 2.35, P = 0.001), comorbidities including cardiovascular disease (HR 1.86, P = 0.031) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (HR 2.24, P = 0.023), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (HR 29.33, P &lt; 0.001) were strong predictors of death.
32240670,And a high level of lymphocytes was predictive of better outcome (HR 0.10, P &lt; 0.001).
32240670,High proportion of severe to critical cases and high fatality rate were observed in the elderly COVID-19 patients.
32240670,Rapid disease progress was noted in the dead with a median survival time of 5 days after admission.
32240670,Dyspnea, lymphocytopenia, comorbidities including cardiovascular disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and acute respiratory distress syndrome were predictive of poor outcome.
32240670,Close monitoring and timely treatment should be performed for the elderly patients at high risk.
32240751,Children are seeing rapid changes to their routines and facing an unpredictable future.
32240751,Palliative care teams may consider expanding their communication training and skillsets to help families consider caring ways to communicate with their children and grandchildren about the coronavirus.
32240751,Palliative care teams are wise to encourage families to ground their communication with children on key values: honesty and trust, self-compassion, safety, sensitivity, connection, preparedness, community-building, recognition of death as a part of the lifecycle, and legacy.
32240754,The COVID-19 pandemic is stressing healthcare systems throughout the world.
32240754,Significant numbers of patients are being admitted to the hospital with severe illness, often in the setting of advanced age and underlying co-morbidities.
32240754,Therefore, palliative care is an important part of the response to this pandemic.
32240754,The Seattle area and UW Medicine have been on the forefront of the pandemic in the US.
32240754,UW Medicine developed a strategy to implement a palliative care response for a multi-hospital healthcare system that incorporates conventional capacity, contingency capacity, and crisis capacity.
32240754,The strategy was developed by our palliative care programs with input from the healthcare system leadership.
32240754,In this publication, we share our multi-faceted strategy to implement high-quality palliative care in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic that incorporates conventional, contingency, and crisis capacity and focuses on the areas of the hospital caring for the most patients: the emergency department, the intensive care units, and the acute care services.
32240754,The strategy focuses on key content areas including identifying and addressing goals of care, addressing moderate and severe symptoms, and supporting family members.
32240754,Strategy planning for delivery of high-quality palliative care in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic represents an important area of need for our healthcare systems.
32240754,We share our experiences developing such a strategy to help other institutions conduct and adapt such strategies more quickly.
32240756,Within weeks, COVID-19 has transformed our practice of palliative care and clinical medicine as we know it.
32240756,Telemedicine has emerged as a critical technology to bring medical care to patients while attempting to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 among patients, families, and clinicians.
32240756,It is also increasingly necessary to preserve scarce resources like personal protective equipment.
32240756,In this article, we share just-in-time tips to support palliative care clinicians and program leaders in providing the best care possible by telemedicine.
32240756,These quick, practical tips cover telemedicine set-up, patient considerations, and clinician considerations.
32240756,Next steps include ensuring equitable access to affordable telemedicine technology for vulnerable populations through creative solutions and financing, and dedicated attention to telemedicine evaluation and quality improvement.
32240764,The severe 2019 outbreak of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which was first reported in Wuhan, would be expected to impact the mental health of local medical and nursing staff and thus lead them to seek help.
32240764,However, those outcomes have yet to be established using epidemiological data.
32240764,To explore the mental health status of medical and nursing staff and the efficacy, or lack thereof, of critically connecting psychological needs to receiving psychological care, we conducted a quantitative study.
32240764,This is the first paper on the mental health of medical and nursing staff in Wuhan.
32240764,Notably, among 994 medical and nursing staff working in Wuhan, 36.9% had subthreshold mental health disturbances (mean PHQ-9: 2.4), 34.4% had mild disturbances (mean PHQ-9: 5.4), 22.4% had moderate disturbances (mean PHQ-9: 9.0), and 6.2% had severe disturbance (mean PHQ-9: 15.1) in the immediate wake of the viral epidemic.
32240764,The noted burden fell particularly heavily on young women.
32240764,Of all participants, 36.3% had accessed psychological materials (such as books on mental health), 50.4% had accessed psychological resources available through media (such as online push messages on mental health self-help coping methods), and 17.5% had participated in counseling or psychotherapy.
32240764,Trends in levels of psychological distress and factors such as exposure to infected people and psychological assistance were identified.
32240764,Although staff accessed limited mental healthcare services, distressed staff nonetheless saw these services as important resources to alleviate acute mental health disturbances and improve their physical health perceptions.
32240764,These findings emphasize the importance of being prepared to support frontline workers through mental health interventions at times of widespread crisis.
32241244,On 31 December 2019, a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, and caused the outbreak of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32241244,To date, computed tomography (CT) findings have been recommended as major evidence for the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 in Hubei, China.
32241244,This review focuses on the imaging characteristics and changes throughout the disease course in patients with COVID-19 in order to provide some help for clinicians.
32241244,Typical CT findings included bilateral ground-glass opacity, pulmonary consolidation, and prominent distribution in the posterior and peripheral parts of the lungs.
32241244,This review also provides a comparison between COVID-19 and other diseases that have similar CT findings.
32241244,Since most patients with COVID-19 infection share typical imaging features, radiological examinations have an irreplaceable role in screening, diagnosis and monitoring treatment effects in clinical practice.
32241801,Two antimalarial agents, chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), have been trusted treatments for a range of rheumatic diseases over the past seventy years [1].
32241801,These agents have attracted intense media attention in the past few weeks with suggestions that this category of drugs may have potential in the management of coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) associated disease called COVID-19 [2, 3].
32242182,There has been a lot of speculation that patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who are receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) may be at increased risk for adverse outcomes.
32242182,We reviewed the available evidence, and have not found this to be the case.
32242182,We recommend that patients on such medications should continue on them unless there is a clinical indication to stop their use.
32242347,The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused a worldwide pandemic.
32242347,Less than 6 weeks after the first confirmed cases in Korea, the patient number exceeded 5,000, which overcrowded limited hospital resources and forced confirmed patients to stay at home.
32242347,To allocate medical resources efficiently, Korea implemented a novel institution for the purpose of treating patients with cohort isolation out of hospital, namely the Community Treatment Center (CTC).
32242347,Herein, we report results of the initial management of patients at one of the largest CTC in Korea.
32242347,A total of 309 patients were admitted to our CTC.
32242347,During the first two weeks, 7 patients were transferred to the hospital because of symptom aggravation and 107 patients were discharged without any complication.
32242347,Although it is a novel concept and may have some limitations, CTC may be a very cost-effective and resource-saving strategy in managing massive cases of COVID-19 or other emerging infectious diseases.
32242348,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-infected pneumonia emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019.
32242348,In this retrospective multicenter study, we investigated the clinical course and outcomes of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from early cases in Republic of Korea.
32242348,All of the cases confirmed by real time polymerase chain reaction were enrolled from the 1st to the 28th patient nationwide.
32242348,Clinical data were collected and analyzed for changes in clinical severity including laboratory, radiological, and virologic dynamics during the progression of illness.
32242348,The median age was 40 years (range, 20-73 years) and 15 (53.6%) patients were male.
32242348,The most common symptoms were cough (28.6%) and sore throat (28.6%), followed by fever (25.0%).
32242348,Diarrhea was not common (10.7%).
32242348,Two patients had no symptoms.
32242348,Initial chest X-ray (CXR) showed infiltration in 46.4% of the patients, but computed tomography scan confirmed pneumonia in 88.9% (16/18) of the patients.
32242348,Six patients (21.4%) required supplemental oxygen therapy, but no one needed mechanical ventilation.
32242348,Lymphopenia was more common in severe cases.
32242348,Higher level of C-reactive protein and worsening of chest radiographic score was observed during the 5-7 day period after symptom onset.
32242348,Viral shedding was high from day 1 of illness, especially from the upper respiratory tract (URT).
32242348,The prodromal symptoms of COVID-19 were mild and most patients did not have limitations of daily activity.
32242348,Viral shedding from URT was high from the prodromal phase.
32242348,Radiological pneumonia was common from the early days of illness, but it was frequently not evident in simple CXR.
32242348,These findings could be plausible explanations for the easy and rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the community.
32242438,South Africa is in the grip of a novel coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19).
32242438,Primary care providers are in the frontline.
32242438,COVID-19 is spread primarily by respiratory droplets contaminating surfaces and hands that then transmit the virus to another person's respiratory system.
32242438,The incubation period is 2-9 days and the majority of cases are mild.
32242438,The most common symptoms are fever, cough and shortness of breath.
32242438,Older people and those with cardiopulmonary co-morbidities or immunological deficiency will be more at risk of severe disease.
32242438,If people meet the case definition, the primary care provider should immediately adopt infection prevention and control measures.
32242438,Diagnosis is made by a RT-PCR test using respiratory secretions, usually nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs.
32242438,Mild cases can be managed at home with self-isolation, symptomatic treatment and follow-up if the disease worsens.
32242438,Contact tracing is very important.
32242438,Observed case fatality is between 0.5% and 4%, but may be overestimated as mild cases are not always counted.
32242438,Primary care providers must give clear, accurate and consistent messages on infection prevention and control in communities and homes.
32242738,The global death toll from COVID-19 virus exceeds 21000.
32242738,The risk factors for death were attributed to advanced age and co-morbidities, but haven't been accurately defined.
32242738,To report the clinical features of 85 fatal cases with COVID-19 in two hospitals in Wuhan.
32242738,Medical records of 85 fatal cases of COVID-19 between January 9 and February 15, 2020 were collected.
32242738,Information recorded included medical history, exposure history, comorbidities, symptoms, laboratory findings, CT scans and clinical management.
32242738,The median age of the patients was 65.8 years and 72.9% were male.
32242738,Common symptoms were fever (78 [91.8%]), shortness of breath (50 [58.8%]), fatigue (50 [58.8%]), dyspnea (60 [70.6%]).
32242738,Hypertension, diabetes and coronary heart disease were the most common comorbidities.
32242738,Notably, 81.2% patients had very low eosinophil counts at admission.
32242738,Complications included respiratory failure (80 [94.1%]), shock (69 [81.2%]), ARDS (63 [74.1%]), arrhythmia (51 [60%]), etc.
32242738,Most patients received antibiotic (77 [90.6%]), antiviral (78 [91.8%]) and glucocorticoids (65 [76.5%]) treatments. 38 patients [44.7%] and 33 [38.8%] received intravenous immunoglobulin and interferon α2b respectively.
32242738,In this depictive study of 85 fatal cases of COVID-19, most cases were male aged over 50 years old with noncommunicable chronic diseases.
32242738,The majority of the patients died of multiple organ failure.
32242738,Early onset of shortness of breath may be used as an observational symptom for COVID-19 exacerbations.
32242738,Eosinophilopenia may indicate a poor prognosis.
32242738,The combination of anti-microbial drugs did not offer considerable benefit to the outcome of this group of patients.

32242947,Currently, the epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has begun to spread worldwide.
32242947,We aim to explore reliable evidence for the diagnosis and treatment of the COVID-19 by analyzing all the published studies by Chinese scholars on the clinical and imaging features in novel coronavirus pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2.
32242947,We searched five medical databases including two Chinese and three English databases for all published articles on COVID-19 since the outbreak.
32242947,A random-effects model was designed, and the imaging and clinical data from all studies were collected for meta-analysis.
32242947,Overall, 31 articles and 46 959 patients were included, including 10 English articles and 21 Chinese articles.
32242947,The results of meta-analysis showed that the most common clinical manifestations were fever (87.3%; 0.838-0.909), cough (58.1%; 0.502-0.660), dyspnea (38.3%; 0.246-0.520), muscle soreness or fatigue (35.5%; 0.253-0.456), and chest distress (31.2%; -0.024 to 0.648).
32242947,The main imaging findings were bilateral pneumonia (75.7%; 0.639-0.871) and ground-glass opacification (69.9%; 0.602-0.796).
32242947,Among the patients, the incidence that required intensive care unit (ICU) was (29.3%; 0.190-0.395), the incidence with acute respiratory distress syndrome was (28.8%; 0.147-0.429), the incidence with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome was (8.5%; -0.008 to 0.179), and the case fatality rate of patients with COVID-19 was (6.8%; 0.044-0.093).
32242947,COVID-19 is a new clinical infectious disease that mainly causes bilateral pneumonia and lung function deteriorates rapidly.
32242947,Nearly a third of patients need to be admitted to the ICU, and patients are likely to present respiratory failure or even death.
32243304,Studies of the novel coronavirus-induced disease COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, have elucidated the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of this disease in the general population.
32243304,The present investigation summarizes the clinical characteristics and early prognosis of COVID-19 infection in a cohort of patients with fractures.
32243304,Data on 10 patients with a fracture and COVID-19 were collected from 8 different hospitals located in the Hubei province from January 1, 2020, to February 27, 2020.
32243304,Analyses of early prognosis were based on clinical outcomes and trends in laboratory results during treatment.
32243304,All 10 patients presented with limited activity related to the fracture.
32243304,The most common signs were fever, cough, and fatigue at the time of presentation (7 patients each).
32243304,Other, less common signs included sore throat (4 patients), dyspnea (5 patients), chest pain (1 patient), nasal congestion (1 patient), headache (1 patient), dizziness (3 patients), abdominal pain (1 patient), and vomiting (1 patient).
32243304,Lymphopenia (&lt;1.0 × 10 cells/L) was identified in 6 of 10 patients, 9 of 9 patients had a high serum level of D-dimer, and 9 of 9 patients had a high level of C-reactive protein.
32243304,Three patients underwent surgery, whereas the others were managed nonoperatively because of their compromised status.
32243304,Four patients died on day 8 (3 patients) or day 14 (1 patient) after admission.
32243304,The clinical outcomes for the surviving patients are not yet determined.
32243304,The clinical characteristics and early prognosis of COVID-19 in patients with fracture tended to be more severe than those reported for adult patients with COVID-19 without fracture.
32243304,This finding may be related to the duration between the development of symptoms and presentation.
32243304,Surgical treatment should be carried out cautiously or nonoperative care should be chosen for patients with fracture in COVID-19-affected areas, especially older individuals with intertrochanteric fractures.
32243304,Prognostic Level IV.

32243668,The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread globally since being identified as a public health emergency of major international concern and has now been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO).
32243668,In December 2019, an outbreak of atypical pneumonia, known as COVID-19, was identified in Wuhan, China.
32243668,The newly identified zoonotic coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), is characterized by rapid human-to-human transmission.
32243668,Many cancer patients frequently visit the hospital for treatment and disease surveillance.
32243668,They may be immunocompromised due to the underlying malignancy or anticancer therapy and are at higher risk of developing infections.
32243668,Several factors increase the risk of infection, and cancer patients commonly have multiple risk factors.
32243668,Cancer patients appear to have an estimated twofold increased risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 than the general population.
32243668,With the WHO declaring the novel coronavirus outbreak a pandemic, there is an urgent need to address the impact of such a pandemic on cancer patients.
32243668,This include changes to resource allocation, clinical care, and the consent process during a pandemic.
32243668,Currently and due to limited data, there are no international guidelines to address the management of cancer patients in any infectious pandemic.
32243668,In this review, the potential challenges associated with managing cancer patients during the COVID-19 infection pandemic will be addressed, with suggestions of some practical approaches.

32243690,In December 2019, an outbreak of COVID-19 occurred in Wuhan, China, and spread to the whole of China and to multiple countries worldwide.
32243690,Unlike SARS and MERS, where secondary transmission mostly occurred in hospital settings, COVID-19 transmission occurs in large numbers within families.
32243690,Herein we report three cases of a familial cluster with one family member being a kidney transplant recipient.
32243690,The initial clinical symptoms of COVID-19 in these three patients were the same, but their progression was different.
32243690,Based on the severity of clinical symptoms, chest computer tomography findings and SARS-Cov-2 RNA test results, we admitted the husband to the respiratory intensive care unit (RICU) and used a treatment consisting of immunosuppressant reduction/cessation and low dose methylprednisolone-based therapy, and his wife to the respiratory isolation ward.
32243690,In contrast, the son received in-home isolation and home-based care.
32243690,All three family members made a full recovery.
32243697,Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a pandemic since March 2020.
32243697,We describe here, two cases of COVID-19 infection in a post-transplant setting.
32243697,First one is a 59-year old renal transplant recipient; the second is a 51-year old allogeneic bone marrow transplant recipient.
32243697,Both patients were on immunosuppressant therapy and had stable graft function before COVID-19 infection.
32243697,After the diagnosis of COVID-19, immunosuppressive agents were discontinued and methylprednisolone with prophylactic antibiotics were initiated, however, the lung injury progressed.
32243697,The T cells were extremely low in both patients after infection.
32243697,Both patients died despite the maximal mechanical ventilatory support.
32243697,Therefore, the prognosis of COVID-19 pneumonia following transplantation is not optimistic and remains guarded.
32243697,Lower T cell count may be a surrogate for poor outcome.
32243911,COVID-19 is a new infectious disease, for which there is currently no treatment.
32243911,It is therefore necessary to explore biomarkers to determine the extent of lung lesions and disease severity.
32243911,We aimed to assess the usefulness of CRP levels in the early stage of COVID-19 and to correlate them with lung lesions and severe presentation.
32243911,Confirmed cases of COVID-19 were selected at the Fever Unit in two regions of Guizhou, China.
32243911,On admission CRP levels were collected, and the diameter of the largest lung lesion was measured in the most severe lung lesion by lung CT scan.
32243911,Differences in the diameter and CRP levels were compared in the following groups of patients: mild group, moderate group, severe group, and critical group.
32243911,CRP levels and the diameter of the largest lung lesion in the moderate group were higher than those in the mild group (Mann-Whitney test=-2.647, -2.171, P˂0.05), those in the severe group were higher than those in the moderate group (Mann-Whitney test=0.693, -2.177, P˂0.05), and those in the critical group were higher than those in the severe group (Mann-Whitney test=-0.068, -1.549, P˂0.05).
32243911,The difference was statistically significant.
32243911,CRP levels were positively correlated with the diameter of lung lesion and severe presentation (correlation coefficient=0.873, 0.734, P˂0.001).
32243911,In the early stage of COVID-19 CRP levels were positively correlated with lung lesions and could reflect disease severity.
32243945,As of March 24, 2020, novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been responsible for 379,661 infection cases with 16,428 deaths globally and the number is still increasing rapidly.
32243945,Herein, we presented four critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who received supportive care and convalescent plasma.
32243945,Although all the four patients (including a pregnant woman) recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection eventually, randomized trials are needed to eliminate the effect of other treatments and investigate the safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma therapy.
32244059,Ever since the first case was reported at the end of 2019, the SARS-COV-2 virus and associated lung disease COVID-19 has spread throughout the world and has become a pandemic.
32244059,In particular, the high transmission rate of the virus has made it a threat to public health globally.
32244059,Currently, there is no proven effective therapy against the virus, and the impact on other diseases is also uncertain, especially inherited arrhythmia syndrome.
32244059,Arrhythmogenic effect of COVID-19 can be expected, potentially contributing to disease outcome.
32244059,This may be of importance for patients with an increased risk for cardiac arrhythmias, either secondary to acquired conditions or co-morbidities or consequent to inherited syndromes.
32244059,Management of patients with inherited arrhythmia syndromes such as Long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, Short QT syndrome and Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic may prove particularly challenging.
32244059,Depending on the inherited defect involved, these patients may be susceptible to pro-arrhythmic effects of COVID-19-related issues such as fever, stress, electrolyte disturbances and use of antiviral drugs.
32244059,We here describe the potential COVID-19 associated risks and therapeutic considerations for patients with distinct inherited arrhythmia syndromes and provide recommendations, pending local possibilities, for their monitoring and management during this pandemic.
32245083,In December 2019, a cluster of fatal pneumonia cases presented in Wuhan, China.
32245083,They were caused by a previously unknown coronavirus.
32245083,All patients had been associated with the Wuhan Wholefood market, where seafood and live animals are sold.
32245083,The virus spread rapidly and public health authorities in China initiated a containment effort.
32245083,However, by that time, travelers had carried the virus to many countries, sparking memories of the previous coronavirus epidemics, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and causing widespread media attention and panic.
32245083,Based on clinical criteria and available serological and molecular information, the new disease was called coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), and the novel coronavirus was called SARS Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), emphasizing its close relationship to the 2002 SARS virus (SARS-CoV).
32245083,The scientific community raced to uncover the origin of the virus, understand the pathogenesis of the disease, develop treatment options, define the risk factors, and work on vaccine development.
32245083,Here we present a summary of current knowledge regarding the novel coronavirus and the disease it causes.
32245264,The COVID-19 coronavirus is currently spreading around the globe with limited treatment options available.
32245264,This article presents the rationale for potentially using old drugs (emetine, other ipecac alkaloids or analogues) that have been used to treat amoebiasis in the treatment of COVID-19.
32245264,Emetine had amongst the lowest reported half-maximal effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>) from over 290 agents screened for the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronaviruses.
32245264,While EC<sub>50</sub> concentrations of emetine are achievable in the blood, studies show that concentrations of emetine can be almost 300 times higher in the lungs.
32245264,Furthermore, based on the relative EC<sub>50</sub>s of emetine towards the coronaviruses compared with <i>Entamoeba histolytica</i>, emetine could be much more effective as an anti-coronavirus agent than it is against amoebiasis.
32245264,This paper also discusses the known side effects of emetine and related compounds, how those side effects can be managed, and the optimal method of administration for the potential treatment of COVID-19.
32245264,Given the serious and immediate threat that the COVID-19 coronavirus poses, our long history with emetine and the likely ability of emetine to reach therapeutic concentrations within the lungs, ipecac, emetine, and other analogues should be considered as potential treatment options, especially if in vitro studies confirm viral sensitivity.
32245395,In this Commentary, we would like to comment on the article titled &quot;A rapid advice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infected pneumonia (standard version)&quot; as a featured article in Military Medical Research.
32245395,In the guideline, except for &quot;confirmed cases&quot;, &quot;suspected cases&quot;, &quot;close contact&quot; and &quot;suspicious exposure&quot; were defined by clinical perspective based on epidemiological risk, clinical symptoms and auxiliary examination.
32245395,Combined with our experience, we introduced a simple scoring proposal additionally based on not only CT imaging as strongly recommended by the guideline but also blood routine test, especially for primary screening of such patients in the out-patient department.
32245396,On 6 February 2020, our team had published a rapid advice guideline for diagnosis and treatment of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection, and this guideline provided our experience and make well reference for fighting against this pandemic worldwide.
32245396,However, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are gradually increasing based on the ongoing research findings and clinical practice experience; hence, the strategies of diagnosis and treatment are also continually updated.
32245396,In this letter, we answered one comment on our guideline and provided the newest diagnostic criteria of &quot;suspected case&quot; and &quot;confirmed case&quot; according to the latest Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh version) that issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
32245590,The novel coronavirus pneumonia broke out in 2019 and spread rapidly.
32245590,In 30 different countries, there are over seventy thousand patients have been diagnosed in total.
32245590,Therefore, it is urgent to develop the effective program to prevent and treat for the novel coronavirus pneumonia.
32245590,In view of Traditional Chinese Medicine has accumulated a solid theoretical foundation of plague in ancient and recent decades.
32245590,Meanwhile, Traditional Chinese Medicine can provide the more effective and personalized treatment via adjusting the specific medicine for each patient based on the different syndromes.
32245590,In addition, TCM often has different effect on the distinct stages of diseases, contributing to the prevention, treatment and rehabilitation.
32245590,Nowadays, TCM has exhibited decent effect in the in the fight against NCP.
32245590,Therefore, it is convinced that Traditional Chinese Medicine is an effective treatment for 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia.
32245814,In the wake of community coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transmission in the United States, there is a growing public health concern regarding the adequacy of resources to treat infected cases.
32245814,Hospital beds, intensive care units (ICUs), and ventilators are vital for the treatment of patients with severe illness.
32245814,To project the timing of the outbreak peak and the number of ICU beds required at peak, we simulated a COVID-19 outbreak parameterized with the US population demographics.
32245814,In scenario analyses, we varied the delay from symptom onset to self-isolation, the proportion of symptomatic individuals practicing self-isolation, and the basic reproduction number <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> Without self-isolation, when <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> = 2.5, treatment of critically ill individuals at the outbreak peak would require 3.8 times more ICU beds than exist in the United States.
32245814,Self-isolation by 20% of cases 24 h after symptom onset would delay and flatten the outbreak trajectory, reducing the number of ICU beds needed at the peak by 48.4% (interquartile range 46.4-50.3%), although still exceeding existing capacity.
32245814,When <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> = 2, twice as many ICU beds would be required at the peak of outbreak in the absence of self-isolation.
32245814,In this scenario, the proportional impact of self-isolation within 24 h on reducing the peak number of ICU beds is substantially higher at 73.5% (interquartile range 71.4-75.3%).
32245814,Our estimates underscore the inadequacy of critical care capacity to handle the burgeoning outbreak.
32245814,Policies that encourage self-isolation, such as paid sick leave, may delay the epidemic peak, giving a window of time that could facilitate emergency mobilization to expand hospital capacity.
32245904,New cases of the novel coronavirus, also known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continue to rise worldwide.
32245904,A few reports have showed that mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 is higher in elderly patients and other active comorbidities including cancer.
32245904,To date, no effective treatment has been identified and management for critically ill patients relies on management in intensive care units.
32245904,Patients with lung cancer are at risk of pulmonary complications from COVID-19.
32245904,Furthermore, the use of chemotherapy might have a negative impact in patient's outcome.
32245904,Therefore, the risk/benefit ratio of systemic anticancer treatment (SACT) has to be considered.
32245904,For each patient, several factors including age and comorbidities, as well as the number of hospital visits for treatment, can influence this risk.
32245904,Each hospital around the world has issued some internal policy guidelines for oncologists, aiming to limit risks during this difficult time.
32245904,We hereby propose a tool to support oncologists and physicians in treatment decision for patients with lung cancer.
32245904,There are several variables to consider, including the extent of the epidemic, the local healthcare structure capacity, the risk of infection to the individual, the status of cancer, patients' comorbidities, age and details of the treatment.
32245904,Given this heterogeneity, we have based our suggestions bearing in mind some general factors There is not easy, universal solution to oncological care during this crisis and, to complicate matters, the duration of this pandemic is hard to predict.
32245904,It is important to weigh the impact of each of our decisions in these trying times rather than rely on routine automatisms.
32246280,To assess the status of health services provision of public tertiary dental hospitals during the COVID-19 epidemic in China and to evaluate the regional difference of telehealth.
32246280,The health services provision of public tertiary dental hospitals in China mainland during the COVID-19 epidemic was inquired.
32246280,The status of non-emergency dental services, emergency dental services, and online professional consultation and the hospitals' geographical distribution were recorded and analyzed.
32246280,All the 48 public tertiary dental hospitals suspended general non-emergency dental treatment while providing emergency dental services only.
32246280,Ninety percent of them notified the change of dental services online, and 69% of them offered free online professional consultations.
32246280,The penetration rate of online technology was significantly higher in the eastern region than that of the central and western regions.
32246280,There was a significant change in the health service provision of Chinese public tertiary dental hospitals during the COVID-19 epidemic and wider use of telehealth in the eastern region.
32246280,This report demonstrated that dental health services were significantly affected by the COVID-19 epidemic in China, which might lead to a long-time impact on dental care in the future.
32246317,Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is commonly complicated with coagulopathy, the difference of coagulation features between severe pneumonia induced by SARS-CoV2 and non-SARS-CoV2 has not been analyzed.
32246317,Coagulation results and clinical features of consecutive patients with severe pneumonia induced by SARS-CoV2 (COVID group) and non-SARS-CoV2 (non-COVID group) in Tongji hospital were retrospectively analyzed and compared.
32246317,Whether patients with elevated D-dimer could benefit from anticoagulant treatment was evaluated.
32246317,There were 449 COVID patients and 104 non-COVID patients enrolled into the study.
32246317,The 28-day mortality in COVID group was approximately twofold of mortality in non-COVID group (29.8% vs.
32246317,15.4%, P = 0.003), COVID group were older (65.1 ± 12.0 vs.
32246317,58.4 ± 18.0, years, P &lt; 0.001) and with higher platelet count (215 ± 100 vs. 188 ± 98, ×10<sup>9</sup>/L, P = 0.015), comparing to non-COVID group.
32246317,The 28-day mortality of heparin users were lower than nonusers In COVID group with D-dimer &gt; 3.0 μg/mL (32.8% vs.
32246317,52.4%, P = 0.017).
32246317,Patients with severe pneumonia induced by SARS-CoV2 had higher platelet count than those induced by non-SARS-CoV2, and only the former with markedly elevated D-dimer may benefit from anticoagulant treatment.
32246787,In the current global home confinement situation due to the COVID-19 outbreak, most individuals are exposed to an unprecedented stressful situation of unknown duration.
32246787,This may not only increase daytime stress, anxiety and depression levels but also disrupt sleep.
32246787,Importantly, because of the fundamental role that sleep plays in emotion regulation, sleep disturbance can have direct consequences upon next day emotional functioning.
32246787,In this paper we summarize what is known about the stress-sleep link and confinement as well as effective insomnia treatment.
32246787,We discuss those effects of the current home confinement situation that can disrupt sleep but also those that could benefit sleep quality.
32246787,We suggest adaptions of cognitive behavioral therapy elements that are feasible to implement for those facing changed work schedules and requirements, those with health anxiety and those handling childcare and homeschooling, whilst also recognizing the general limitations imposed on physical exercise and social interaction.
32246787,Managing sleep problems as best as possible during home confinement can limit stress and possibly prevent disruptions of social relationships.
32246834,An outbreak of 2019-nCoV infection in China has spread across the world.
32246834,No specific antiviral drugs have been approved for the treatment of COVID-2019.
32246834,In addition to the recommended antiviral drugs such as interferon-ɑ, lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, and chloroquine phosphate, some clinical trials focusing on virus RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitors have been registered and initiated.
32246834,Favipiravir, a purine nucleic acid analog and potent RdRp inhibitor approved for use in influenza, is also considered in several clinical trials.
32246834,Herein, we summarized the pharmacokinetic characteristics of favipiravir and possible drug-drug interactions from the view of drug metabolism.
32246834,We hope this will be helpful for the design of clinical trials for favipiravir in COVID-2019, as data regarding in vitro virus inhibition and efficacy in preclinical animal studies are still not available.
32246879,Over the past few decades, several blood-borne viruses have targeted hemophilia patients requiring treatment with clotting factors derived from human plasma [1].
32246879,Even today, many hemophilia patients and their families still retain painful and indelible memories of HIV and hepatitis C infections or are confronted with the progressive health consequences of these infections.
32247050,The rapid spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a zoonotic beta-coronavirus entitled 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), has become a global threat.
32247050,Awareness of the biological features of 2019-nCoV should be updated in time and needs to be comprehensively summarized to help optimize control measures and make therapeutic decisions.
32247050,Based on recently published literatures, official documents and selected up-to-date preprint studies, we reviewed the virology and origin, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, pathology and treatment of 2019-nCoV infection, in comparison with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection.
32247050,The genome of 2019-nCoV partially resembled SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and indicating a bat origin.
32247050,The COVID-19 generally had a high reproductive number, a long incubation period, a short serial interval and a low case fatality rate (much higher in patients with comorbidities) than SARS and MERS.
32247050,Clinical presentation and pathology of COVID-19 greatly resembled SARS and MERS, with less upper respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms, and more exudative lesions in post-mortems.
32247050,Potential treatments included remdesivir, chloroquine, tocilizumab, convalescent plasma and vaccine immunization (when possible).
32247050,The initial experience from the current pandemic and lessons from the previous two pandemics can help improve future preparedness plans and combat disease progression.
32247056,Specialist Palliative Care services (SPCS) have a vital role to play in the global COVID-19 pandemic.
32247056,Core expertise in complex symptom management, decision-making in uncertainty, advocacy and education, and ensuring a compassionate response are essential, and SPCS are well positioned to take a proactive approach in crisis management planning.
32247056,SPCS resource capacity is likely to be overwhelmed, and consideration needs to be given to empowering and supporting high-quality primary palliative care in all care locations.
32247056,Our local SPCS have developed a Palliative Care Pandemic Pack to disseminate succinct and specific information, guidance, and resources designed to enable the rapid up-skilling of non-specialist clinicians needing to provide palliative care.
32247056,It may be a useful tool for our SPCS colleagues to adapt as we face this global challenge collaboratively.
32247066,In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, specific recommendations are required for the management of patients with gynecologic cancer.
32247066,The FRANCOGYN group of the National College of French Gynecologists and Obstetricians (CNGOF) convened to develop recommendations based on the consensus conference model.
32247066,If a patient with a gynecologic cancer presents with COVID-19, surgical management should be postponed for at least 15 days.
32247066,For cervical cancer, radiotherapy and concomitant radiochemotherapy could replace surgery as first-line treatment and the value of lymph node staging should be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.
32247066,For advanced ovarian cancers, neoadjuvant chemotherapy should be preferred over primary cytoreduction surgery.
32247066,It is legitimate not to perform hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32247066,For patients who are scheduled to undergo interval surgery, chemotherapy can be continued and surgery performed after 6 cycles.
32247066,For patients with early stage endometrial cancer of low and intermediate preoperative ESMO risk, hysterectomy with bilateral adnexectomy combined with a sentinel lymph node procedure is recommended.
32247066,Surgery can be postponed for 1-2 months in low-risk endometrial cancers (FIGO Ia stage on MRI and grade 1-2 endometrioid cancer on endometrial biopsy).
32247066,For patients of high ESMO risk, the MSKCC algorithm (combining PET-CT and sentinel lymph node biopsy) should be applied to avoid pelvic and lumbar-aortic lymphadenectomy.
32247066,During the COVID-19 pandemic, management of a patient with cancer should be adapted to limit the risks associated with the virus without incurring loss of chance.
32247211,No drugs are currently approved for Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19), although some have been tried.
32247211,In view of recent studies and discussion on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), we aimed to review existing literature and relevant websites regarding these drugs and COVID-19, adverse effects related to drugs, and related guidelines.
32247211,We systematically searched the PubMed database up till March 21, 2020 and retrieved all the articles published on chloroquine and HCQ and COVID-19.
32247211,Two small human studies have been conducted with both these drugs in COVID-19, and have shown significant improvement in some parameters in patients with COVID-19.
32247211,Considering minimal risk upon use, a long experience of use in other diseases, cost-effectiveness and easy availability across India, we propose that both these drugs are worthy of fast track clinical trial for treatment, and may be carefully considered for clinical use as experimental drugs.
32247211,Since HCQ has been approved for treatment of diabetes in India, it should be further researched in diabetes and COVID-19, a subgroup where significant mortality has been shown.
32247213,Multiple issues in management of COVID have emerged, but confusion persists regarding rational interpretation.
32247213,Aim of this brief review is to review these issues based on current literature.
32247213,This is a narrative review with Pubmed and Google Scholar search till 23 March 2020.
32247213,Search terms were, COVID-19, treatment of coronavirus, COVID 19 and following terms; chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, ibuprofen, ACE-inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, cardiovascular disease, diarrhoea, liver, testis and gastrointestinal disease.
32247213,We discuss evidence regarding role of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in treatment and prophylaxis, use of inhibitors of the renin angiotensin system, safety of ibuprofen, unusual clinical features like gastrointestinal symptoms and interpretation of tests for cardiac enzymes and biomarkers.
32247213,While our conclusions on management of COVID-19 patients with co-morbidities are based on current evidence, however, data is limited and there is immediate need for fast track research.
32247898,COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently a global pandemic.
32247898,This paper will attempt to estimate global infection rates and potential resultant mortality in the absence of effective treatment and/or vaccination.
32247898,Calculations are based on World Health Organisation data from Wuhan in China: 14% of infected cases are severe, 5% require intensive care and 4% die.
32247898,Estimated infection rates and mortality rates at the level of continents and some individual countries (when these are of sufficient size) are tabulated.
32247898,This pandemic may cause close to half a billion deaths, i.e. 6% of the global population - and potentially more.
32247898,At the risk of sounding sensational, but with a sober sense of realism, healthcare risks being plunged into the Middle-Ages if the public do not do their part.
32247898,Infection cannot occur in the absence of contact.
32247898,The only way to mitigate these numbers is to apply social distancing and take the standard precautions so frequently reiterated by Public Health: hand washing, avoid touching the face and so on.
32247898,These measures are crucial as the human cost is going to be unthinkable even in the best-case scenarios that epidemiologists are modelling.
32247927,The novel coronavirus infection that initially found at the end of 2019 has attracted great attention.
32247927,So far, the number of infectious cases has increased globally to more than 100 thousand and the outbreak has been defined as a pandemic situation, but there are still no &quot;specific drug&quot; available.
32247927,Relevant reports have pointed out the novel coronavirus has 80% homology with SARS.
32247927,In the difficulty where new synthesized drug cannot be applied immediately to patients, &quot;conventional drug in new use&quot; becomes a feasible solution.
32247927,The first medication experience of the recovered patients in the US has led remdesivir to be the &quot;specific drug&quot;.
32247927,China has also taken immediate action to put remdesivir into clinical trials with the purpose of applying it into clinical therapeutics for Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32247927,We started from the structure, immunogenicity, and pathogenesis of coronavirus infections of the novel coronavirus.
32247927,Further, we analyzed the pharmacological actions and previous trials of remdesivir to identify the feasibility of conducting experiments on COVID-19.
32247931,Since the outbreak of 2019-nCoV in December, Chinese government has implemented various measures including travel bans, centralized treatments, and home quarantines to slowing the transmission across the country.
32247931,In this study, we aimed to estimate the incidence of 2019-nCoV infection among people under home quarantine in Shenzhen, China.
32247931,We used a stratified multistage random sampling method to recruit participants and collected demographic information and laboratory results of people under home quarantine.
32247931,We conducted descriptive analysis to estimate the basic characteristics and to calculate the incidence in out study population.
32247931,A total of 2004 people under home quarantine participated in this study, of which 1637 participants finished the questionnaire with a response rate of 81.7%.
32247931,Mean age of the participants was 33.7 years, ranging from 0.3 to 80.2 years.
32247931,Of people who provided clear travel history, 129 people have traveled to Wuhan city and 1,046 people have traveled to other cities in Hubei province within 14 days before the home quarantine.
32247931,Few (less than 1%) participants reported contact history with confirmed or suspected cases during their trip and most of these arrived at Shenzhen between Jan 24, 2020 to Jan 27, 2020.
32247931,The incidence of COVID-19 in the sample was 1.5‰ (95% CI: 0.31‰-4.37‰).
32247931,Home quarantine has been effective in preventing the early transmission of COVID-19, but that more needs to be done to improve early detection of COVID-19 infection.
32248387,This opinion article discusses the increasing attention paid to the role of activating damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) in initiation of inflammatory diseases and suppressing/inhibiting DAMPs (SAMPs) in resolution of inflammatory diseases and, consequently, to the future roles of these novel biomarkers as therapeutic targets and therapeutics.
32248387,Since controlled production of DAMPs and SAMPs is needed to achieve full homeostatic restoration and repair from tissue injury, only their pathological, not their homeostatic, concentrations should be therapeutically tackled.
32248387,Therefore, distinct caveats are proposed regarding choosing DAMPs and SAMPs for therapeutic purposes.
32248387,For example, we discuss the need to a priori identify and define a context-dependent &quot;homeostatic DAMP:SAMP ratio&quot; in each case and a &quot;homeostatic window&quot; of DAMP and SAMP concentrations to guarantee a safe treatment modality to patients.
32248387,Finally, a few clinical examples of how DAMPs and SAMPs might be used as therapeutic targets or therapeutics in the future are discussed, including inhibition of DAMPs in hyperinflammatory processes (e.g., systemic inflammatory response syndrome, as currently observed in Covid-19), administration of SAMPs in chronic inflammatory diseases, inhibition of SAMPs in hyperresolving processes (e.g., compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome), and administration/induction of DAMPs in vaccination procedures and anti-cancer therapy.
32248521,In response to the World Health Organization (WHO) statements and international concerns regarding the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, FIGO has issued the following guidance for the management of pregnant women at the four main settings of pregnancy: (1) ambulatory antenatal care in the outpatient clinics; (2) management in the setting of the obstetrical triage; (3) intrapartum management; and (4) postpartum management and neonatal care.
32248521,We also provide guidance on the medical treatment of pregnant women with COVID-19 infection.
32248675,To report the first eight cases of critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hong Kong, describing the treatments and supportive care they received and their 28-day outcomes.
32248675,Multicentre retrospective observational cohort study.
32248675,Three multidisciplinary intensive care units (ICUs) in Hong Kong.
32248675,All adult critically ill patients with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to ICUs in Hong Kong between 22 January and 11 February 2020. 28-day mortality.
32248675,Eight out of 49 patients with COVID-19 (16%) were admitted to Hong Kong ICUs during the study period.
32248675,The median age was 64.5 years (range, 42–70) with a median admission Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of 6 (IQR, 4–7).
32248675,Six patients (75%) required mechanical ventilation, six patients (75%) required vasopressors and two (25%) required renal replacement therapy.
32248675,None of the patients required prone ventilation, nitric oxide or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.
32248675,The median times to shock reversal and extubation were 9 and 11 days respectively.
32248675,At 28 days, one patient (12%) had died and the remaining seven (88%) all survived to ICU discharge.
32248675,Only one of the survivors (14%) still required oxygen at 28 days.
32248675,Critically ill patients with COVID-19 often require a moderate duration of mechanical ventilation and vasopressor support.
32248675,Most of these patients recover and survive to ICU discharge with supportive care using lung protective ventilation strategies, avoiding excess fluids, screening and treating bacterial co-infection, and timely intubation.
32248675,Lower rather than upper respiratory tract viral burden correlates with clinical severity of illness.
32248966,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a novel betacoronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first described in a cluster of patients presenting with pneumonia symptoms in Wuhan, China, in December of 2019.
32248966,Over the past few months, COVID-19 has developed into a worldwide pandemic, with over 400,000 documented cases globally as of March 24, 2020.
32248966,The SARS-CoV-2 virus is most likely of zoonotic origin, but has been shown to have effective human-to-human transmission.
32248966,COVID-19 results in mild symptoms in the majority of infected patients, but can cause severe lung injury, cardiac injury, and death.
32248966,Given the novel nature of COVID-19, no established treatment beyond supportive care exists currently, but extensive public-health measures to reduce person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 have been implemented globally to curb the spread of disease, reduce the burden on healthcare systems, and protect vulnerable populations, including the elderly and those with underlying medical comorbidities.
32248966,Since this is an emerging infectious disease, there is, as of yet, limited data on the effects of this infection on patients with cardiovascular disease, particularly so for those with congenital heart disease.
32248966,We summarize herewith the early experience with COVID-19 and consider the potential applicability to and implications for patients with cardiovascular disease in general and congenital heart disease in particular.
32249063,Coronavirus (CoV) disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 (also known as 2019-nCoV) is threatening global public health, social stability, and economic development.
32249063,To meet this challenge, this article discusses advances in the research and development of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) for the prevention and treatment of infection by SARS-CoV-2 and other human CoVs.
32249089,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel and lethal infectious disease, posing a threat to global health security.
32249089,The number of cases has increased rapidly, but no data concerning kidney transplant (KTx) recipients infected with COVID-19 are available.
32249089,To present the epidemiological, clinical, and therapeutic characteristics of KTx recipients infected with COVID-19, we report on a case series of five patients who were confirmed as having COVID-19 through nucleic acid testing (NAT) from January 1, 2020 to February 28, 2020.
32249089,The most common symptoms on admission to hospital were fever (five patients, 100%), cough (five patients, 100%), myalgia or fatigue (three patients, 60%), and sputum production (three patients, 60%); serum creatinine or urea nitrogen levels were slightly higher than those before symptom onset.
32249089,Four patients received a reduced dose of maintenance immunosuppressive therapy during hospitalization.
32249089,As of March 4, 2020 NAT was negative for COVID-19 in three patients twice in succession, and their computed tomography scans showed improved images.
32249089,Although greater patient numbers and long-term follow-up data are needed, our series demonstrates that mild COVID-19 infection in KTx recipients can be managed using symptomatic support therapy combined with adjusted maintenance immunosuppressive therapy.
32249098,The Covid-19 pandemic is changing the organization of healthcare and has a direct impact on digestive surgery.
32249098,Healthcare priorities and circuits are being modified.
32249098,Emergency surgery is still a priority.
32249098,Functional surgery is to be deferred.
32249098,Laparoscopic surgery must follow strict rules so as not to expose healthcare professionals (HCPs) to added risk.
32249098,The question looms large in cancer surgery-go ahead or defer?
32249098,There is probably an added risk due to the pandemic that must be balanced against the risk incurred by deferring surgery.
32249098,For each type of cancer-colon, pancreas, oesogastric, hepatocellular carcinoma-morbidity and mortality rates are stated and compared with the oncological risk incurred by deferring surgery and/or the tumour doubling time.
32249098,Strategies can be proposed based on this comparison.
32249098,For colonic cancers T1-2, N0, it is advisable to defer surgery.
32249098,For advanced colonic lesions, it seems judicious to undertake neoadjuvant chemotherapy and then wait.
32249098,For rectal cancers T3-4 and/or N+, chemoradiotherapy is indicated, short radiotherapy must be discussed (followed by a waiting period) to reduce time of exposure in the hospital and to prevent infections.
32249098,Most complex surgery with high morbidity and mortality-oesogastric, hepatic or pancreatic-is most often best deferred.
32249102,The novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19), which was first detected in Wuhan City, has now became a pandemic that affecting patients around the world.
32249102,Particularly, the community patient population are at high risk of infection and are facing potential failure of proper medication use during the pandemic.
32249102,To discuss community pharmacists' role and the content of pharmaceutical care (PC) during the novel coronavirus pandemic to promote effective prevention and control and safe drug use of the community patient population.
32249102,Collect and summarize the experience Chinese community pharmacies gained from providing pharmacy services during the COVID-19 outbreak, and taking patients' PC needs into consideration, analyze and discuss the methods and strategies that community pharmacies and pharmacists shall use to provide PC during the pandemic.
32249102,Community pharmacy management teams shall support PC services by providing adequate supply of COVID-19 related medications and preventative products, following environment regulations, and providing sufficient staff trainings.
32249102,Pharmacists shall use various approaches to provide PC services in drug dispensing, consulting and referrals, chronic disease management, safe use of infusions, patient education, home care guidance and psychological support to promote the COVID-19 pandemic control and ensure safe medication use of community patients during the pandemic.
32249102,PC services in communities during the COVID-19 shall possess different properties due to disease characteristics and related change in patients' need.
32249102,Community pharmacies shall work as a strong supporter of patient's medication and protective equipment supply.
32249102,Community pharmacists shall be prepared to provide skilled and effective PC services for community patient population to ensure medication safety and promote the overall COVID-19 pandemic control.
32249257,The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic that has developed in late 2019 and 2020 is a serious threat to human health.
32249257,With no vaccines or drugs approved for prevention and treatment until now, all efforts at drug design and/or clinical trials of already approved drugs are worthy and creditable.
32249257,Using structure-based drug selection for identification of SARS-CoV-2 protease inhibitors, old drugs such as macrolides (MAC) were predicted to be effective for COVID-19.
32249257,Lately, the anti-viral effects of macrolides have attracted considerable attention.
32249257,Very recently, hydroxychloroquine in combination with azithromycin treatment was reported to be effective for COVID-19.
32249257,We believe that treatments with macrolides alone or in combination with other drugs are promising and open the possibility of an international strategy to fight this emerging viral infection.
32249357,Analyze the relationship between obesity and influenza.
32249357,Basal hormone milieu, defective response of both innate and adaptive immune system and sedentariness are major determinants in the severity of influenza viral infection in obese patients.
32249357,Being overweight not only increases the risk of infection and of complications for the single obese person, but a large prevalence of obese individuals within the population might increase the chance of appearance of more virulent viral strain, prolongs the virus shedding throughout the total population and eventually might increase overall mortality rate of an influenza pandemic.
32249357,Waiting for the development of a vaccination against COVID-19, isolation of positive cases and social distancing are the primary interventions.
32249357,Nonetheless, evidence from previous influenza pandemics suggests the following interventions aimed at improving immune response: (1) lose weight with a mild caloric restriction; (2) include AMPK activators and PPAR gamma activators in the drug treatment for obesity associated with diabetes; and (3) practice mild-to-moderate physical exercise.
32249357,Due to prolonged viral shedding, quarantine in obese subjects should likely be longer than normal weight individuals.
32249943,Acute respiratory disease (ARD) caused by 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has rapidly spread throughout China.
32249943,Children and adults show a different clinical course.
32249943,The purpose of the current study is to comparatively analyze the clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV infection in children and adults and to explore the possible causes for the discrepancies present.
32249943,The medical records of 25 adults and 7 children confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV ARD were reviewed retrospectively.
32249943,All children were family clusters.
32249943,The total adult patients were differentiated into: the local residents of Wuhan, a history of travel to Wuhan and direct contact with people from Wuhan.
32249943,The numbers were 14 (56%), 10 (40%) &amp; 1 (4%), respectively.
32249943,The median incubation period of children and adults was 5 days (range 3-12 days) and 4 days (range 2-12 days), respectively.
32249943,Diarrhoea and/or vomiting (57.1%) were more common in children, whereas for adults it was myalgia or fatigue (52%).
32249943,On admission, the percentage of children having pneumonia (5, 71.4%) was roughly the same as adults (20, 80%). 20% of adults had leucopoenia, but leukocytosis was more frequently in children (28.6%, P=0.014).
32249943,A higher number of children had elevated creatine kinase isoenzyme (57.1% vs.
32249943,4%, P=0.004).
32249943,Antiviral therapy was given to all adult patients but to none of the children.
32249943,In summary, knowledge of these differences between children and adults will not only be helpful for the clinical diagnosis of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), but also for a future discussion on age-specific coronavirus infection.

32250049,Few children have been reported to have been affected by novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); it is unclear whether children are less likely to be infected or rather display fewer symptoms.
32250049,We present the case of a 32-day-old boy infected by COVID-19 that presented with an upper air way infection which resolved spontaneously and did not require any therapy.
32250049,We argue that in epidemic settings children presenting with any mild symptom potentially attributable to COVID-19 should be considered contagious until proven otherwise, and that management must be guided by clinical conditions.
32250170,Given the dramatic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to divulge all the available technologies with the potential to fight against this virus.
32250170,Plant biotechnology offers potential solutions to this pandemic through the development of low-cost vaccines and antibodies useful for therapy, prophylaxis, and diagnosis.
32250170,The technology to produce plant-made biopharmaceuticals is already established; two examples of these are: a therapeutic enzyme that has entered the market and the influenza vaccines that are currently under clinical trials with encouraging results.
32250170,Thus far, some companies have started developing anti-COVID-19 antibodies and vaccines.
32250170,In particular, plant-made antibodies might be timely produced and approved for human use in the short term, while the development of vaccines will take longer time (clinical evaluations could be concluded by the end of 2021); nonetheless, the candidates obtained will be valuable tools for future outbreaks.
32250170,The key aspects that will define the exploitation of this technology in the fight against COVID-19 are discussed.
32250244,The discovery that SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) binds to the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-2, which is highly expressed in the lower airways, explained why SARS-CoV-2 causes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and respiratory failure.
32250244,After this, news spread that ACEis and ARBs would be harmful in SARS-CoV-2-infected subjects.
32250244,To the contrary, compelling evidence exists that the ACE-1/angiotensin(Ang)II/ATR-1 pathway is involved in SARS-CoV-2-induced ARDS, while the ACE-2/Ang(1-7)/ATR2/MasR pathway counteracts the harmful actions of AngII in the lung.
32250244,A reduced ACE-1/ACE-2 ratio is, in fact, a feature of ARDS that can be rescued by human recombinant ACE-2 and Ang(1-7) administration, thus preventing SARS-CoV-2-induced damage to the lung.
32250244,Based on the current clinical evidence treatment with ACE-inhibitors I (ACEis) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) continues to provide cardiovascular and renal protection in patients diagnosed with COVID-19.
32250244,Discontinuing these medications may therefore be potentially harmful in this patient population.
32250347,In December 2019, in the city of Wuhan, in the Hubei province of China, treatment-resistant cases of pneumonia emerged and spread rapidly for reasons unknown.
32250347,A new strain of coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 [SARS-CoV-2]) was identified and caused the first pandemic of the 21st century.
32250347,The virus was officially detected in our country on March 11, 2020, and the number of cases increased rapidly; the virus was isolated in 670 patients within 10 days.
32250347,The rapid increase in the number of patients has required our physicians to learn to protect both the public and themselves when treating patients with this highly infectious disease.
32250347,The group most affected by the outbreak and with the highest mortality rate is elderly patients with known cardiovascular disease.
32250347,Therefore, it is necessary for cardiology specialists to take an active role in combating the epidemic.
32250347,The aim of this article is to make a brief assessment of current information regarding the management of cardiovascular patients affected by COVID-19 and to provide practical suggestions to cardiology specialists about problems and questions they have frequently encountered.
32250385,In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) emerged in China and has spread globally, creating a pandemic.
32250385,Information about the clinical characteristics of infected patients who require intensive care is limited.
32250385,To characterize patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) requiring treatment in an intensive care unit (ICU) in the Lombardy region of Italy.
32250385,Retrospective case series of 1591 consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 referred for ICU admission to the coordinator center (Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy) of the COVID-19 Lombardy ICU Network and treated at one of the ICUs of the 72 hospitals in this network between February 20 and March 18, 2020.
32250385,Date of final follow-up was March 25, 2020.
32250385,SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of nasal and pharyngeal swabs.
32250385,Demographic and clinical data were collected, including data on clinical management, respiratory failure, and patient mortality.
32250385,Data were recorded by the coordinator center on an electronic worksheet during telephone calls by the staff of the COVID-19 Lombardy ICU Network.
32250385,Of the 1591 patients included in the study, the median (IQR) age was 63 (56-70) years and 1304 (82%) were male.
32250385,Of the 1043 patients with available data, 709 (68%) had at least 1 comorbidity and 509 (49%) had hypertension.
32250385,Among 1300 patients with available respiratory support data, 1287 (99% [95% CI, 98%-99%]) needed respiratory support, including 1150 (88% [95% CI, 87%-90%]) who received mechanical ventilation and 137 (11% [95% CI, 9%-12%]) who received noninvasive ventilation.
32250385,The median positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) was 14 (IQR, 12-16) cm H2O, and Fio2 was greater than 50% in 89% of patients.
32250385,The median Pao2/Fio2 was 160 (IQR, 114-220).
32250385,The median PEEP level was not different between younger patients (n = 503 aged ≤63 years) and older patients (n = 514 aged ≥64 years) (14 [IQR, 12-15] vs 14 [IQR, 12-16] cm H2O, respectively; median difference, 0 [95% CI, 0-0]; P = .94).
32250385,Median Fio2 was lower in younger patients: 60% (IQR, 50%-80%) vs 70% (IQR, 50%-80%) (median difference, -10% [95% CI, -14% to 6%]; P = .006), and median Pao2/Fio2 was higher in younger patients: 163.5 (IQR, 120-230) vs 156 (IQR, 110-205) (median difference, 7 [95% CI, -8 to 22]; P = .02).
32250385,Patients with hypertension (n = 509) were older than those without hypertension (n = 526) (median [IQR] age, 66 years [60-72] vs 62 years [54-68]; P &lt; .001) and had lower Pao2/Fio2 (median [IQR], 146 [105-214] vs 173 [120-222]; median difference, -27 [95% CI, -42 to -12]; P = .005).
32250385,Among the 1581 patients with ICU disposition data available as of March 25, 2020, 920 patients (58% [95% CI, 56%-61%]) were still in the ICU, 256 (16% [95% CI, 14%-18%]) were discharged from the ICU, and 405 (26% [95% CI, 23%-28%]) had died in the ICU.
32250385,Older patients (n = 786; age ≥64 years) had higher mortality than younger patients (n = 795; age ≤63 years) (36% vs 15%; difference, 21% [95% CI, 17%-26%]; P &lt; .001).
32250385,In this case series of critically ill patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to ICUs in Lombardy, Italy, the majority were older men, a large proportion required mechanical ventilation and high levels of PEEP, and ICU mortality was 26%.
32250961,Background: During outbreaks of diseases a great amount of health threatening misinformation is produced and released.
32250961,In the web-2 era much of this misinformation is disseminated via social media where information could spread easily and quickly.
32250961,Monitoring social media content provides crucial insights for health managers to manage the crisis.
32250961,Objective: Given the misinformation surrounding COVID-19 outbreak, this study was aimed to analyze contents of the most commonly used social networks in Iran that is among the affected countries.
32250961,Methods: A social media monitoring conducted through a qualitative design to analyze the discussions of social media users about the content related to COVID-19 transferred via Iranian medical faculty members` groups in Telegram and Whats App during Feb 20 to March 20, 2020 emphasizing the misinformation.
32250961,Discourse analysis was applied and the written dialogues and discussions regarding misinformation about different aspects of the outbreak between medical faculty members all over the country were analyzed.
32250961,Results: Cultural factors, demand pressure for information during the crisis, the easiness of information dissemination via social networks, marketing incentives and the poor legal supervision of online contents are the main reasons of misinformation dissemination.
32250961,Disease statistics; treatments, vaccines and medicines; prevention and protection methods; dietary recommendations and disease transmission ways are the main subjective categories of releasing misinformation regarding novel coronavirus outbreak.
32250961,Consequences of misinformation dissemination regarding disease include psychosocial; economic; health status; health system and ethical ones.
32250961,Active and effective presence of health professionals and authorities on social media during the crisis and the improvement of public health literacy in the long term are the most recommended strategies for dealing with issues related to misinformation.
32250961,Conclusion: This study contributes the management of COVID-19 outbreak trough providing applicable insights for health managers to manage public information in this challenging time.
32251003,Critical patients with the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), even those whose nucleic acid test results had turned negative and those receiving maximal medical support, have been noted to progress to irreversible fatal respiratory failure.
32251003,Lung transplantation (LT) as the sole therapy for end-stage pulmonary fibrosis related to acute respiratory distress syndrome has been considered as the ultimate rescue therapy for these patients.
32251003,From February 10 to March 10, 2020, three male patients were urgently assessed and listed for transplantation.
32251003,After conducting a full ethical review and after obtaining assent from the family of the patients, we performed three LT procedures for COVID-19 patients with illness durations of &gt;1 month and extremely high sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores.
32251003,Two of the three recipients survived post-LT and started participating in a rehabilitation program.
32251003,Pearls of the LT team collaboration and perioperative logistics were summarized and continually improved.
32251003,The pathological results of the explanted lungs were concordant with the critical clinical manifestation, and provided insight towards better understanding of the disease.
32251003,Government health affair systems, virology detection tools, and modern communication technology all play key roles towards the survival of the patients and their rehabilitation.
32251003,Lung transplantation can be performed in end-stage patients with respiratory failure due to COVID-19-related pulmonary fibrosis.
32251003,If confirmed positive-turned-negative virology status without organ dysfunction, LT provided the final option for these patients to avoid certain death, with proper protection of transplant surgeons and medical staffs.
32251003,By ensuring instant seamless care for both patients and medical teams, the goal of reducing the mortality rate and salvaging the lives of patients with COVID-19 can be attained.
32251618,SARS-CoV-2 first emerged in China in December 2019 and rapidly spread worldwide.
32251618,No vaccine or approved drug is available to eradicate the virus, however, some drugs that are indicated for other afflictions seems to be potentially beneficial to treat the infection albeit without unequivocal evidence.
32251618,The aim of this article is to review the published background on the effectiveness of these drugs against COVID-19 Methods: A thorough literature search was conducted on recently published studies which have published between January 1 to March 25, 2020.
32251618,PubMed, Google Scholar and Science Direct databases were searched Results: A total 22 articles were found eligible. 8 discuss about treatment outcomes from their applied drugs during treatment of COVID-19 patients, 4 report laboratory tests, one report animal trial and other 9 articles discuss recommendations and suggestions based on the treatment process and clinical outcomes of other diseases such as malaria, ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).
32251618,The data and/or recommendations are categorized in 4 classes: (a) anti-viral and anti-inflammatory drugs, (b) anti-malaria drugs, (c) traditional Chinese drugs and (d) other treatments/drugs.
32251618,All examined treatments, although potentiality effective against COVID-19, need either appropriate drug development or clinical trial to be suitable for clinical use.
32251634,In December 2019, the Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) virus has emerged in Wuhan, China.
32251634,In this research, the first resolved COVID-19 crystal structure (main protease) was targeted in a virtual screening study by of FDA approved drugs dataset.
32251634,In addition, a knowledge gap in relations of COVID-19 with the previously known fatal Coronaviruses (CoVs) epidemics, SARS and MERS CoVs, was covered by investigation of sequence statistics and phylogenetics.
32251634,Molecular modeling, virtual screening, docking, sequence comparison statistics and phylogenetics of the COVID-19 main protease were investigated.
32251634,COVID-19 Mpro formed a phylogenetic group with SARS CoV that was distant from MERS CoV.
32251634,The identity% was 96.061 and 51.61 for COVID-19/SARS and COVID-19/MERS CoV sequence comparisons, respectively.
32251634,The top 20 drugs in the virtual screening studies comprised a broad-spectrum antiviral (ribavirin), anti-hepatitis B virus (telbivudine), two vitamins (vitamin B12 and nicotinamide) and other miscellaneous systemically acting drugs.
32251634,Of special interest, ribavirin had been used in treating cases of SARS CoV.
32251634,The present study provided a comprehensive targeting of the first resolved COVID+19 structure of Mpro and found a suitable save drugs for repurposing against the viral Mpro.
32251634,Ribavirin, telbivudine, vitamin B12 and nicotinamide can be combined and used for COVID treatment.
32251634,This initiative relocates already marketed and approved safe drugs for potential use in COVID-treatment.
32251717,Severe COVID-19 associated pneumonia patients may exhibit features of systemic hyper-inflammation designated under the umbrella term of macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) or cytokine storm, also known as secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistocytosis (sHLH).
32251717,This is distinct from HLH associated with immunodeficiency states termed primary HLH -with radically different therapy strategies in both situations.
32251717,COVID-19 infection with MAS typically occurs in subjects with adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and historically, non-survival in ARDS was linked to sustained IL-6 and IL-1 elevation.
32251717,We provide a model for the classification of MAS to stratify the MAS-like presentation in COVID-19 pneumonia and explore the complexities of discerning ARDS from MAS.
32251717,We discuss the potential impact of timing of anti-cytokine therapy on viral clearance and the impact of such therapy on intra-pulmonary macrophage activation and emergent pulmonary vascular disease.
32251731,The recent emergence of the novel pathogenic SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for a worldwide pandemic.
32251731,Given the global health emergency, drug repositioning is the most reliable option to design an efficient therapy for infected patients without delay.
32251731,The first step of the viral replication cycle [i.e. attachment to the surface of respiratory cells, mediated by the spike (S) viral protein] offers several potential therapeutic targets.
32251731,The S protein uses the angiotension-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor for entry, but also sialic acids linked to host cell surface gangliosides.
32251731,Using a combination of structural and molecular modelling approaches, this study showed that chloroquine (CLQ), one of the drugs currently under investigation for SARS-CoV-2 treatment, binds sialic acids and gangliosides with high affinity.
32251731,A new type of ganglioside-binding domain at the tip of the N-terminal domain of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein was identified.
32251731,This domain (111-158), which is fully conserved among clinical isolates worldwide, may improve attachment of the virus to lipid rafts and facilitate contact with the ACE-2 receptor.
32251731,This study showed that, in the presence of CLQ [or its more active derivative, hydroxychloroquine (CLQ-OH)], the viral S protein is no longer able to bind gangliosides.
32251731,The identification of this new mechanism of action of CLQ and CLQ-OH supports the use of these repositioned drugs to cure patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.
32251731,The in-silico approaches used in this study might also be used to assess the efficiency of a broad range of repositioned and/or innovative drug candidates before clinical evaluation.
32251767,An escalating pandemic by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus is impacting global health and effective therapeutic options are urgently needed.
32251767,We evaluated the in vitro antiviral effect of compounds that were previously reported to inhibit coronavirus replication and compounds that are currently under evaluation in clinical trials for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
32251767,We report the antiviral effect of remdesivir, lopinavir, homorringtonine, and emetine against SARS-CoV-2 virus in Vero E6 cells with the estimated 50% effective concentration at 23.15 μM, 26.63 μM, 2.55 μM and 0.46 μM, respectively.
32251767,Ribavirin or favipiravir that are currently evaluated under clinical trials showed no inhibition at 100 μM.
32251767,Synergy between remdesivir and emetine was observed, and remdesivir at 6.25 μM in combination with emetine at 0.195 μM may achieve 64.9% inhibition in viral yield.
32251767,Combinational therapy may help to reduce the effective concentration of compounds below the therapeutic plasma concentrations and provide better clinical benefits.
32251790,Hong Kong has been recently attacked by the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19).
32251790,In late January 2020, it's shown a steadily increasing trend of confirmed cases.
32251790,There is a 257 in total infected cases confirmed including 4 deaths until 20<sup>th</sup> of March 2020.
32251790,To prevent further outbreak of COVID-19, this article discusses the current understanding of COVID-19 and compares with the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in 2003 of Hong Kong from the causes, transmission, symptoms, diagnosis, treatments and preventions to study for an applicable measurement to control COVID-19.
32251794,The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged since December 2019 in Wuhan city, and has quickly spread throughout China and other countries.
32251794,To date, no specific treatment has been proven to be effective for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32251794,According to World Health Organization (WHO), management of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) has mainly focused on infection prevention, case detection and monitoring, and supportive care.
32251794,Given to the previous experience, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been proven to be an effective therapy in the treatment of respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
32251794,On the basis of similar principle, ECMO may be also an effective therapy in the treatment of severe COVID-19.
32251794,In this study, we described and discussed the clinical outcomes of ECMO for ARDS patients, ECMO use for severe COVID-19 in China, the indications of ECMO use, and some important issues associated with ECMO.
32251796,From 78 laboratory-confirmed cases, we found 2 asymptomatic infections.
32251796,One patient was discharged within 14 days after treatment.
32251796,Another patient was discharged 25 days after treatment, and his TR-PCR test was still positive on the 15th day.
32251796,We found that there may be virus carriers in asymptomatic population with epidemiological contact history.
32251796,After 14 days of isolation, asymptomatic infection may still carry the virus, which means the risk of transmission and present a new challenge to home isolation.
32252338,The world is in the grip of the COVID-19 pandemic.
32252338,Public health measures that can reduce the risk of infection and death in addition to quarantines are desperately needed.
32252338,This article reviews the roles of vitamin D in reducing the risk of respiratory tract infections, knowledge about the epidemiology of influenza and COVID-19, and how vitamin D supplementation might be a useful measure to reduce risk.
32252338,Through several mechanisms, vitamin D can reduce risk of infections.
32252338,Those mechanisms include inducing cathelicidins and defensins that can lower viral replication rates and reducing concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines that produce the inflammation that injures the lining of the lungs, leading to pneumonia, as well as increasing concentrations of anti-inflammatory cytokines.
32252338,Several observational studies and clinical trials reported that vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of influenza, whereas others did not.
32252338,Evidence supporting the role of vitamin D in reducing risk of COVID-19 includes that the outbreak occurred in winter, a time when 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations are lowest; that the number of cases in the Southern Hemisphere near the end of summer are low; that vitamin D deficiency has been found to contribute to acute respiratory distress syndrome; and that case-fatality rates increase with age and with chronic disease comorbidity, both of which are associated with lower 25(OH)D concentration.
32252338,To reduce the risk of infection, it is recommended that people at risk of influenza and/or COVID-19 consider taking 10,000 IU/d of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> for a few weeks to rapidly raise 25(OH)D concentrations, followed by 5000 IU/d.
32252338,The goal should be to raise 25(OH)D concentrations above 40-60 ng/mL (100-150 nmol/L).
32252338,For treatment of people who become infected with COVID-19, higher vitamin D<sub>3</sub> doses might be useful.
32252338,Randomized controlled trials and large population studies should be conducted to evaluate these recommendations.
32252979,Due to the current pandemic of respiratory disease known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, many patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection will require elective surgery, surgery that cannot be postponed, or emergency surgical treatment.
32252979,In these situations, special measures need to be adopted in order to minimize the possibility of transmission between patients, exposure of healthcare personnel and the development of postoperative complications.
32252979,This document explains the main principles to consider when managing confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients during evaluation as well as when surgical treatment is required.
32253068,The Coronavirus-associated disease, that was first identified in 2019 in China (CoViD-19), is a pandemic caused by a bat-derived beta-coronavirus, named SARS-CoV2.
32253068,It shares homology with SARS and MERS-CoV, responsible for past outbreaks in China and in Middle East.
32253068,SARS-CoV2 spread from China where the first infections were described in December 2019 and is responsible for the respiratory symptoms that can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome.
32253068,A cytokine storm has been shown in patients who develop fatal complications, as observed in past coronavirus infections.
32253068,The management includes ventilatory support and broad-spectrum antiviral drugs, empirically utilized, as a targeted therapy and vaccines have not been developed.
32253068,Based upon our limited knowledge on the pathogenesis of CoViD-19, a potential role of some anti-rheumatic drugs may be hypothesized, acting as direct antivirals or targeting host immune response.
32253068,Antimalarial drugs, commonly used in rheumatology, may alter the lysosomal proteases that mediates the viral entry into the cell and have demonstrated efficacy in improving the infection.
32253068,Anti-IL-1 and anti-IL-6 may interfere with the cytokine storm in severe cases and use of tocilizumab has shown good outcomes in a small cohort.
32253068,Baricitinib has both antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties.
32253068,Checkpoints inhibitors such as anti-CD200 and anti-PD1 could have a role in the treatment of CoViD-19.
32253068,Rheumatic disease patients taking immunosuppressive drugs should be recommended to maintain the chronic therapy, prevent infection by avoiding social contacts and pausing immunosuppressants in case of infection.
32253068,National and international registries are being created to collect data on rheumatic patients with CoViD-19.
32253318,Currently, there are no approved specific antiviral agents for novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32253318,In this study, 10 severe patients confirmed by real-time viral RNA test were enrolled prospectively.
32253318,One dose of 200 mL of convalescent plasma (CP) derived from recently recovered donors with the neutralizing antibody titers above 1:640 was transfused to the patients as an addition to maximal supportive care and antiviral agents.
32253318,The primary endpoint was the safety of CP transfusion.
32253318,The second endpoints were the improvement of clinical symptoms and laboratory parameters within 3 d after CP transfusion.
32253318,The median time from onset of illness to CP transfusion was 16.5 d.
32253318,After CP transfusion, the level of neutralizing antibody increased rapidly up to 1:640 in five cases, while that of the other four cases maintained at a high level (1:640).
32253318,The clinical symptoms were significantly improved along with increase of oxyhemoglobin saturation within 3 d.
32253318,Several parameters tended to improve as compared to pretransfusion, including increased lymphocyte counts (0.65 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L vs.
32253318,0.76 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L) and decreased C-reactive protein (55.98 mg/L vs.
32253318,18.13 mg/L).
32253318,Radiological examinations showed varying degrees of absorption of lung lesions within 7 d.
32253318,The viral load was undetectable after transfusion in seven patients who had previous viremia.
32253318,No severe adverse effects were observed.
32253318,This study showed CP therapy was well tolerated and could potentially improve the clinical outcomes through neutralizing viremia in severe COVID-19 cases.
32253318,The optimal dose and time point, as well as the clinical benefit of CP therapy, needs further investigation in larger well-controlled trials.
32253400,Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic, progressive lung disease with few successful treatments, and is strongly associated with cigarette smoking (CS).
32253400,Since the novel coronavirus has spread worldwide seriously, there is growing concern that patients who have chronic respiratory conditions like COPD can easily be infected and are more prone to having severe illness and even mortality because of lung dysfunction.
32253400,Loquat leaves have long been used as an important material for both pharmaceutical and functional applications in the treatment of lung disease in Asia, especially in China and Japan.
32253400,Total flavonoids (TF), the main active components derived from loquat leaves, showed remarkable anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities.
32253400,However, their protective activity against CS-induced COPD airway inflammation and oxidative stress and its underlying mechanism still remain not well-understood.
32253400,The present study uses a CS-induced mouse model to estimate the morphological changes in lung tissue.
32253400,The results demonstrated that TF suppressed the histological changes in the lungs of CS-challenged mice, as evidenced by reduced generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), nitric oxide (NO), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and diminished the protein expression of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1).
32253400,Moreover, TF also inhibited phosphorylation of IKK, IκB and NFκB and increased p-Akt.
32253400,Interestingly, TF could inhibit CS-induced oxidative stress in the lungs of COPD mice.
32253400,TF treatment significantly inhibited the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) and increased the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD).
32253400,In addition, TF markedly downregulated TRPV1 and cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) and upregulated the expression of SOD-2, while the p-JNK level was observed to be inhibited in COPD mice.
32253400,Taken together, our findings showed that the protective effect and putative mechanism of the action of TF resulted in the inhibition of inflammation and oxidative stress through the regulation of TRPV1 and the related signal pathway in lung tissues.
32253400,It suggested that TF derived from loquat leaves could be considered to be an alternative or a new functional material and used for the treatment of CS-induced COPD.
32253759,Tocilizumab (TCZ), a monoclonal antibody against interleukin-6 (IL-6), emerged as an alternative treatment for COVID-19 patients with a risk of cytokine storms recently.
32253759,In the present study, we aimed to discuss the treatment response of TCZ therapy in COVID-19 infected patients.
32253759,The demographic, treatment, laboratory parameters of C-reactive protein (CRP) and IL-6 before and after TCZ therapy and clinical outcome in the 15 COVID-19 patients were retrospectively assessed.
32253759,Totally 15 patients with COVID-19 were included in this study.
32253759,Two of them were moderately ill, six were seriously ill and seven were critically ill.
32253759,The TCZ was used in combination with methylprednisolone in eight patients.
32253759,Five patients received the TCZ administration twice or more.
32253759,Although TCZ treatment ameliorated the increased CRP in all patients rapidly, for the four critically ill patients who received an only single dose of TCZ, three of them (No. 1, 2, and 3) still dead and the CRP level in the rest one patient (No. 7) failed to return to normal range with a clinical outcome of disease aggravation.
32253759,Serum IL-6 level tended to further spiked firstly and then decreased after TCZ therapy in 10 patients.
32253759,A persistent and dramatic increase of IL-6 was observed in these four patients who failed treatment.
32253759,TCZ appears to be an effective treatment option in COVID-19 patients with a risk of cytokine storms.
32253759,And for these critically ill patients with elevated IL-6, the repeated dose of the TCZ is recommended.
32253799,A severe cutaneous drug reaction resembling acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis resulting from ingestion of hydroxychloroquine has been documented.
32253799,It is distinguishable by its longer incubation period, more varied morphology with initially urticarial and later targetoid and arcuate plaques, recalcitrance to therapy and longer duration.
32253799,Given the anticipated surge in the use of hydroxychloroquine due to its reported benefits in those with coronavirus disease 2019, specific recognition of this entity is pivotal.
32253799,We delineate it as generalized pustular figurate erythema.
32253888,CoV-19/SARS-CoV-2 is a highly pathogenic virus that causes coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19) an acute respiratory distress syndrome which provokes serious problems for global health.
32253888,Studies suggest that there are many differences between men and women in the immune response to CoV-19 infection and inflammatory diseases.
32253888,Women, compared to men, are less susceptible to viral infections based on a different innate immunity, steroid hormones and factors related to sex chromosomes.
32253888,The presence of two X chromosomes in women emphasize the immune system even if one is inactive.
32253888,The immune regulatory genes encoded by X chromosome in female gender causes lower viral load levels, and less inflammation than in man, while CD4+ T cells are higher with better immune response.
32253888,In addition, women generally produce higher levels of antibodies which remain in the circulation longer.
32253888,The levels of activation of the immune cells are higher in women than in men, and it is correlated with the trigger of TLR7 and the production of IFN.
32253888,TLR7 is higher in women than in men and its biallelic expression leads to higher immune responses and increases the resistance to viral infections.
32253888,TLR7 is expressed in innate immune cells which recognizes single strand RNA virus by promoting the production of antibodies against the virus and the generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-6 and IL-1 family members.
32253888,Moreover, in women the production of inflammatory IL-6 after viral infection is lower than in males and is often correlated with a better longevity.
32253888,In addition, on the X chromosome there are loci that code for the genes involved in the regulation of immune cells such as FOXP3, and transcription factor for Treg involved in virus pathogenesis.
32253888,The X chromosome influences the immune system by acting on many other proteins, including TLR8, CD40L and CXCR3 which can be over-expressed in women, and influence the response to viral infections and vaccinations.
32253888,However, the biallelic expression of the X-linked genes can promote harmful autoimmune and inflammatory responses.
32253888,Cardiovascular diseases are more frequent in males and subjects without cardiovascular dysfunctions infected by CoV-19 have a better prognosis, but these effects are still under study.
32253888,It is hoped that certain drugs, such as CoV-19 receptor blockers, anti-inflammatories (against rheumatic diseases), monoclonal antibodies, anti-IL-1 and anti-IL-6, the remdesevir drug (analogue adenosine, effective against ebola), hydroxychloroquine (for the treatment of malaria) and vaccines, will open up new strategies and new therapeutic ways to combat this terrible virus.
32253890,Talent training is the core and foundation of public health system construction.
32253890,Shortage of talents in the field of disease prevention and public health exposed by COVID-19 pandemic highlights the importance of developing preventive medical education.
32253890,This article analyzes the challenges of medical education in the dilemma of &quot;separation of medical treatment and prevention&quot;, and the new requirements for preventive medical education in the construction of New Medicine under the Healthy China strategy.
32253890,Four aspects including stepping up the resource allocation and investment, educating responsible public health professionals, the education of all medical students who implement the core competence of public health, and the establishment of a continuing education system for preventive medicine have been considered.
32253890,A series of specific suggestions are put forward including the establishment of a full-chain closed-loop research system to support the cultivation of top-notch innovative public health talents, strengthening the assessment of core public health capabilities for clinical medical professional admission, formulating a &quot;medical and preventive integration&quot; training program for primary health personnel, and implementing &quot;combination of peace and war&quot; public health personnel reserve system, with the purpose of providing reference for the reform and development of preventive medical education in China.
32253890,人才培养是公共卫生体系建设的核心和基石，新型冠状病毒肺炎疫情暴露出的疾病预防与公共卫生领域人才匮乏问题，更突显了改革发展预防医学教育的重要性。
32253890,本文分析了&quot;医防分离&quot;现实困境中医学教育面临的挑战，以及健康中国战略下新医科建设对预防医学教育提出的新要求，从加大预防医学教育资源配置和投入力度、培养&quot;顶天立地&quot;的公共卫生专业人才、实施公共卫生核心能力的全体医学生教育、建立健全预防医学继续教育制度等四个方面进行了思考，并提出建立全链条闭环的研究体系支撑公共卫生拔尖创新人才培养、加强临床医学专业执医准入的公共卫生核心能力考核、制定&quot;医防融合&quot;的基层卫生人才培养方案、实施&quot;平战结合&quot;模式下的公共卫生人才预备役制度等一系列具体建议，以期对我国预防医学教育改革发展提供参考。.
32253891,As a newly epidemic, COVID-19 with a concentrated outbreak poses a great challenge to medical treatment.
32253891,The severe and critical patients are complex complicatied with the psychological problems, and the medical staff are overworked and under tremendous psychological pressure.
32253891,The surgeon participated in emergency medical rescue could provide professional treatment for the patients combined with surgical diseases, specialized training for the non-surgeon crew, to reduce surgical-related mortality.
32253891,With the advantages of good team consciousness, strong aseptic concept and good psychological quality, the surgeons can quickly adapt to and carry out rescue work under the premise of good self-protection.
32253891,Surgeons need to develop critical care management concepts and focus on the critical care support equipment associated with the outbreak.
32253891,Some suggestions are put forward for the standardized training of resident surgeons to cultivate compound talents.
32253891,It is hoped that this artical can lead to the thinking of how to participate in the emergency medical rescue of infectious diseases among surgeons and provide some enlightenment for future surgical education.
32253891,作为新发传染病，集中暴发的新型冠状病毒肺炎（COVID-19）对医疗救治提出很大挑战。
32253891,尤其是重症及危重症患者病情复杂，合并较多心理问题，而医务人员超负荷工作同时承受巨大心理压力。
32253891,外科医师参与应急医疗救援，可对患者合并的外科疾病进行专科处理，同时对非外科医师培训COVID-19治疗过程中常见的外科相关问题，降低外科相关病死率。
32253891,外科医师结合自身特点，扬长补短，利用团队意识佳、无菌观念强及心理素质好的优势，在可做好自身防护的前提下快速适应并开展救援工作；同时建立重症管理观念，重点掌握疫情相关重症支持设备，针对疫情特点快速转型。
32253891,建议结合外科住院医师规范化培训培养复合型外科人才。
32253891,希望上述思考可以对外科医师更好地参与传染病应急医疗救援及外科教育提供参考。.
32254064,Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), has spurred a global health crisis.
32254064,To date, there are no proven options for prophylaxis for those who have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2, nor therapy for those who develop COVID-19.
32254064,Immune (i.e. &quot;convalescent&quot;) plasma refers to plasma that is collected from individuals, following resolution of infection and development of antibodies.
32254064,Passive antibody administration through transfusion of convalescent plasma may offer the only short-term strategy to confer immediate immunity to susceptible individuals.
32254064,There are numerous examples, where convalescent plasma has been used successfully as post-exposure prophylaxis and/or treatment of infectious diseases, including other outbreaks of coronaviruses (e.g., SARS-1, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome [MERS]).
32254064,Convalescent plasma has also been used in the COVID-19 pandemic; limited data from China suggest clinical benefit, including radiological resolution, reduction in viral loads and improved survival.
32254064,Globally, blood centers have robust infrastructure to undertake collections and construct inventories of convalescent plasma to meet the growing demand.
32254064,Nonetheless, there are nuanced challenges, both regulatory and logistical, spanning donor eligibility, donor recruitment, collections and transfusion itself.
32254064,Data from rigorously controlled clinical trials of convalescent plasma are also few, underscoring the need to evaluate its use objectively for a range of indications (e.g., prevention vs treatment) and patient populations (e.g., age, comorbid disease).
32254064,We provide an overview of convalescent plasma, from evidence of benefit, regulatory considerations, logistical work flow and proposed clinical trials, as scale up is brought underway to mobilize this critical resource. .
32255382,The current outbreak of COVID-19 pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan, China, spreads across national and international borders.
32255382,The overall death rate of COVID-19 pneumonia in Chinese population was 4%.
32255382,To describe process of hospitalization and critical care of decedents with COVID-19 pneumonia.
32255382,This was a multi-center observational study of 109 decedents with COVID-19 pneumonia from three hospitals in Wuhan.
32255382,Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and treatment data were collected and analyzed, and final date of follow-up was February 24, 2020.
32255382,The mean age of 109 decedents with COVID-19 pneumonia was 70.7 years, and 35 (32.1%) patients were female.
32255382,85 (78.0%) patients suffered from one or more underlying comorbidities.
32255382,Multiple organ failure, especially respiratory failure and heart failure, appeared in all patients even at early stage of disease.
32255382,Overall, from onset of symptom to death, the mean time was 22.3 days.
32255382,All 109 hospitalized patients needed ICU admission, however, only 51 (46.8%) had such a chance because of limited availability.
32255382,The period of hospitalization to death in ICU group and non-ICU group was 15.9 days (SD, 8.8 days) and 12.5 days (8.6 days, P = 0.044), respectively.
32255382,Mortality due to COVID-19 pneumonia was concentrated in old people whose age was always above 65 years, especially those with major comorbidities.
32255382,Patients admitted to ICU lived longer than those who did not gain admission to ICU.
32255382,Our findings should aid in the recognition and clinical management of such infections, especially ICU resource allocation.
32255489,Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) appears to be a promising treatment for COVID-19.
32255489,However, all ongoing clinical trials with HCQ use different dosing regimens, resulting on various concentrations PK studies are therefore needed to define the optimal dosing regimen.
32255507,SARS-CoV-2, a novel virus that causes COVID-19 infection, has recently emerged and caused a deadly pandemic.
32255507,Studies have shown that this virus causes worse outcomes and a higher mortality rate in older adults and those with comorbidities such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and chronic kidney disease.
32255507,A significant percentage of older American adults have these diseases, putting them at a higher risk of infection.
32255507,Additionally, many adults with hypertension, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease are placed on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs).
32255507,Studies have shown that these medications upregulate the ACE-2 receptor, the very receptor which the SARS-CoV-2 virus uses to enter host cells, which puts older adults at a further increased risk of infection.
32255507,In this review, we discuss the transmission, symptomatology, mortality, and possible treatments for this infection, as they relate to older adults.

32255510,Patients on immunomodulators, including biologic agents and new small molecular inhibitors, for cutaneous disease, represent a potentially vulnerable population during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32255510,There is currently insufficient evidence to determine whether patients on systemic immunomodulators are at increased risk of developing COVID-19 disease or more likely to have severe disease.
32255510,As such, clinicians need to assess the benefit-to-risk ratio on a case-by-case basis.
32255510,In patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 disease, all immunomodulators used for skin diseases should be immediately withheld, with the possible exception of systemic corticosteroid therapy, which needs to be weaned.
32255510,In patients who develop symptoms or signs of an upper respiratory tract infection, but COVID-19 is not yet confirmed, consider dose reduction or temporarily cessation for 1-2 weeks.
32255510,In otherwise well patients, immunomodulators and biologics should be continued.
32255510,In all patients, and their immediate close contacts, the importance of preventative measures to minimise human-to-human transmission cannot be over emphasized.
32256547,The World Health Organization (WHO) was informed on December 2019 about a coronavirus pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, Hubei province (China).
32256547,Subsequently, on March 12, 2020, 125,048 cases and 4,614 deaths were reported.
32256547,Coronavirus is an enveloped RNA virus, from the genus <i>Betacoronavirus</i>, that is distributed in birds, humans, and other mammals.
32256547,WHO has named the novel coronavirus disease as COVID-19.
32256547,More than 80 clinical trials have been launched to test coronavirus treatment, including some drug repurposing or repositioning for COVID-19.
32256547,Hence, we performed a search in March 2020 of the clinicaltrials.gov database.
32256547,The eligibility criteria for the retrieved studies were: contain a clinicaltrials.gov base identifier number; describe the number of participants and the period for the study; describe the participants' clinical conditions; and utilize interventions with medicines already studied or approved for any other disease in patients infected with the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV).
32256547,It is essential to emphasize that this article only captured trials listed in the clinicaltrials.gov database.
32256547,We identified 24 clinical trials, involving more than 20 medicines, such as human immunoglobulin, interferons, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, arbidol, remdesivir, favipiravir, lopinavir, ritonavir, oseltamivir, methylprednisolone, bevacizumab, and traditional Chinese medicines (TCM).
32256547,Although drug repurposing has some limitations, repositioning clinical trials may represent an attractive strategy because they facilitate the discovery of new classes of medicines; they have lower costs and take less time to reach the market; and there are existing pharmaceutical supply chains for formulation and distribution.
32256547,En diciembre de 2019 fue informado a la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS) un brote de neumonía por coronavirus en Wuhan, provincia de Hubei, China.
32256547,Al 12 de marzo de 2020, se habían notificado 125 048 casos y 4 614 muertes.
32256547,El coronavirus es un virus ARN envuelto del género <i>Betacoronavirus</i> distribuido en aves, seres humanos y otros mamíferos.
32256547,La OMS ha denominado a la nueva enfermedad por coronavirus COVID-19.
32256547,Se han puesto en marcha más de 80 ensayos clínicos para evaluar un tratamiento para el coronavirus, que incluyen algunos ensayos de reposicionamiento de medicamentos para la COVID-19.
32256547,En marzo de 2020 se llevó a cabo una búsqueda de los ensayos clínicos registrados en la base de datos clinicaltrials.gov.
32256547,Los criterios de elegibilidad para los estudios recuperados fueron tener un número de identificación de la base de datos clinicaltrials.gov; describir el número de participantes y el período del estudio; describir las condiciones clínicas de los participantes; y emplear intervenciones con medicamentos ya estudiados o aprobados para cualquier otra enfermedad en pacientes infectados con el nuevo coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV).
32256547,Es esencial destacar que este artículo solo recoge los ensayos que figuran en la base de datos clinicaltrials. gov.
32256547,Se identificaron 24 ensayos clínicos relacionados con más de 20 medicamentos, como inmunoglobulina humana, interferones, cloroquina, hidroxicloroquina, arbidol, remdesivir, favipiravir, lopinavir, ritonavir, oseltamivir, metilprednisolona, bevacizumab y medicina tradicional china.
32256547,Aunque el reposicionamiento de medicamentos tiene algunas limitaciones, el reposicionamiento de los ensayos clínicos puede representar una estrategia atractiva porque facilita el descubrimiento de nuevas clases de medicamentos; estos tienen costos más bajos y tardan menos en llegar al mercado; y existen cadenas de suministro farmacéutico que apoyan la formulación y la distribución.
32256547,A Organização Mundial da Saúde (OMS) foi informada, em dezembro de 2019, sobre um surto de pneumonia por coronavírus em Wuhan, província de Hubei (China).
32256547,Posteriormente, em 12 de março de 2020, 125 048 casos e 4 614 mortes haviam sido registrados.
32256547,O coronavírus é um vírus RNA envelopado do gênero <i>Betacoronavírus,</i> distribuído em aves e em humanos e outros mamíferos.
32256547,A OMS designou a nova doença por coronavírus como COVID-19.
32256547,Mais de 80 ensaios clínicos foram iniciados para testar tratamentos para o coronavírus, incluindo alguns de reposicionamento de medicamentos para o COVID-19.
32256547,Assim, em março de 2020 realizou-se uma busca na base de dados clinicaltrials.gov.
32256547,Os critérios de elegibilidade para os estudos recuperados foram: conter o número identificador da base de dados clinicaltrials.gov; descrever o número de participantes e o período do estudo; descrever as condições clínicas dos participantes; e utilizar intervenções para tratamento de doentes infectados com o novo coronavírus SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV) com medicamentos já estudados ou aprovados para qualquer outra doença.
32256547,É essencial salientar que este artigo apenas capturou ensaios listados na base de dados clinicaltrials.gov.
32256547,Foram identificados 24 ensaios clínicos envolvendo mais de 20 medicamentos, tais como imunoglobulina humana, interferons, cloroquina, hidroxicloroquina, arbidol, remdesivir, favipiravir, lopinavir, ritonavir, oseltamivir, metilprednisolona, bevacizumabe e medicamentos chineses tradicionais.
32256547,Embora o reposicionamento de medicamentos tenha algumas limitações, os ensaios clínicos de reposicionamento podem representar uma estratégia atraente, porque facilitam a descoberta de novas classes de medicamentos, têm custos mais baixos, levam menos tempo para chegar ao mercado e se beneficiam de cadeias de fornecimento farmacêutico já existentes para formulação e distribuição.
32256705,Cancer and transplant patients with COVID-19 have a higher risk of developing severe and even fatal respiratory diseases, especially as they may be treated with immune-suppressive or immune-stimulating drugs.
32256705,This review focuses on the effects of these drugs on host immunity against COVID-19.
32256705,Using Ovid MEDLINE, we reviewed current evidence for immune-suppressing or -stimulating drugs: cytotoxic chemotherapy, low-dose steroids, tumour necrosis factorα (TNFα) blockers, interlukin-6 (IL-6) blockade, Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, IL-1 blockade, mycophenolate, tacrolimus, anti-CD20 and CTLA4-Ig. 89 studies were included.
32256705,Cytotoxic chemotherapy has been shown to be a specific inhibitor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus in in vitro studies, but no specific studies exist as of yet for COVID-19.
32256705,No conclusive evidence for or against the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the treatment of COVID-19 patients is available, nor is there evidence indicating that TNFα blockade is harmful to patients in the context of COVID-19.
32256705,COVID-19 has been observed to induce a pro-inflammatory cytokine generation and secretion of cytokines, such as IL-6, but there is no evidence of the beneficial impact of IL-6 inhibitors on the modulation of COVID-19.
32256705,Although there are potential targets in the JAK-STAT pathway that can be manipulated in treatment for coronaviruses and it is evident that IL-1 is elevated in patients with a coronavirus, there is currently no evidence for a role of these drugs in treatment of COVID-19.
32256705,The COVID-19 pandemic has led to challenging decision-making about treatment of critically unwell patients.
32256705,Low-dose prednisolone and tacrolimus may have beneficial impacts on COVID-19.
32256705,The mycophenolate mofetil picture is less clear, with conflicting data from pre-clinical studies.
32256705,There is no definitive evidence that specific cytotoxic drugs, low-dose methotrexate for auto-immune disease, NSAIDs, JAK kinase inhibitors or anti-TNFα agents are contraindicated.
32256705,There is clear evidence that IL-6 peak levels are associated with severity of pulmonary complications.
32257537,A coronavirus (HCoV-19) has caused the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in Wuhan, China.
32257537,Preventing and reversing the cytokine storm may be the key to save the patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia.
32257537,Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been shown to possess a comprehensive powerful immunomodulatory function.
32257537,This study aims to investigate whether MSC transplantation improves the outcome of 7 enrolled patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in Beijing YouAn Hospital, China, from Jan 23, 2020 to Feb 16, 2020.
32257537,The clinical outcomes, as well as changes of inflammatory and immune function levels and adverse effects of 7 enrolled patients were assessed for 14 days after MSC injection.
32257537,MSCs could cure or significantly improve the functional outcomes of seven patients without observed adverse effects.
32257537,The pulmonary function and symptoms of these seven patients were significantly improved in 2 days after MSC transplantation.
32257537,Among them, two common and one severe patient were recovered and discharged in 10 days after treatment.
32257537,After treatment, the peripheral lymphocytes were increased, the C-reactive protein decreased, and the overactivated cytokine-secreting immune cells CXCR3+CD4+ T cells, CXCR3+CD8+ T cells, and CXCR3+ NK cells disappeared in 3-6 days.
32257537,In addition, a group of CD14+CD11c+CD11b<sup>mid</sup> regulatory DC cell population dramatically increased.
32257537,Meanwhile, the level of TNF-α was significantly decreased, while IL-10 increased in MSC treatment group compared to the placebo control group.
32257537,Furthermore, the gene expression profile showed MSCs were ACE2<sup>-</sup> and TMPRSS2<sup>-</sup> which indicated MSCs are free from COVID-19 infection.
32257537,Thus, the intravenous transplantation of MSCs was safe and effective for treatment in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, especially for the patients in critically severe condition.
32257554,A new study published by the journal Aging &amp; Disease reported that intravenous administration of clinical-grade human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) resulted in improved functional outcomes (<i>Leng et al., Aging Dis, 11:216-228, 2020</i>).
32257554,This study demonstrated that intravenous infusion of MSCs is a safe and effective approach for treating patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, including elderly patients displaying severe pneumonia.
32257554,COVID-19 is a severe acute respiratory illness caused by a new coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32257554,Currently, treating COVID-19 patients, particularly those afflicted with severe pneumonia, is challenging as no specific drugs or vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are available.
32257554,Therefore, MSC therapy inhibiting the overactivation of the immune system and promoting endogenous repair by improving the lung microenvironment after the SARS-CoV-2 infection found in this study is striking.
32257554,Additional studies in a larger cohort of patients are needed to validate this therapeutic intervention further, however.
32258207,The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly in China.
32258207,Until now, no definite effective treatment has been identified.
32258207,We reported on 3 patients with severe COVID-19 who received high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) with satisfactory recovery.
32258207,Based on these observations, randomized studies of high-dose IVIg should be considered in deteriorating patients infected with COVID-19.
32258351,Recent international epidemics of coronavirus-associated illnesses underscore the urgent medical and public health need for vaccine development and regulatory body approved therapies.
32258351,In particular, the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has quickly intensified interest in developing treatment options to mitigate impact on human life.
32258351,Remdesivir (GS-5734™) is a broad-spectrum antiviral drug that is now being tested as a potential treatment for COVID-19 in international, multi-site clinical trials.
32258351,Currently available evidence about the antiviral effects of remdesivir against coronaviruses is primarily based on <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> studies (including some on a chemically related compound, GS-441524™), which have demonstrated largely favorable findings.
32258351,As the pandemic progresses, information from human compassionate use cases will continue to accumulate before the clinical trials are concluded.
32258351,It is imperative for public health practitioners and the One Health community to stay up to date on the most promising potential therapeutic options that are under investigation.
32258351,Thus, the purpose of this review is to synthesize the knowledge to date about remdesivir as a therapeutic option for coronaviruses, with a special focus on information relevant to the One Health community.
32259123,The main strategy of the Ministry of Health (MOH) for the control of COVID-19 is active case finding using electronic tools, taking advantage of the capacity of the national primary health care (PHC) network, and community engagement.
32259123,To accomplish this, all people are asked to participate in the screening process using the MOH's self-assessment portal (salamat.gov.ir).
32259123,Health workers and public volunteers actively contact suspected cases using information recorded in this portal, as well as the electronic health record (SIB portal).
32259123,They actively evaluate individuals, follow-up them, and provide them with necessary information.
32259123,Where needed, clients are referred to 16-hour treatment clinics, which are specifically set up for the diagnosis and treatment of the disease, to the hospitals, or will be treated at home.
32259123,The preliminary results of this national campaign (launched nationwide last week) is provided in this factsheet.
32259129,Coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19 has rapidly emerged as a global pandemic.
32259129,This viral infection involves the upper respiratory tract and could lead to severe pneumonia with respiratory distress or even death.
32259129,Certain studies have found higher initial plasma levels of most pro-inflammatory cytokines during the course of the infection.
32259129,In this context, both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> studies have revealed that metronidazole could decrease the levels of several cytokines, which are known to increase during the COVID-19 infection, including interleukin (IL)8, IL6, IL1B, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α, IL12, IL1α, and interferon (IFN)γ, as well as the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and neutrophil count.
32259129,Furthermore, the drug could decrease neutrophil-generated reactive oxygen species during inflammation.
32259129,Metronidazole could counteract majority of the immunopathological manifestations of the COVID-19 infection.
32259129,Therefore, studies with a large sample size are required to determine the efficacy of metronidazole in the treatment of COVID-19 infection.
32259247,It is nearly impossible to overestimate the burden of chronic pain, which is associated with enormous personal and socioeconomic costs.
32259247,Chronic pain is the leading cause of disability in the world, is associated with multiple psychiatric co-morbidities, and has been causally linked for the opioid crisis.
32259247,Access to pain treatment has been called a fundamental human right by numerous organizations.
32259247,The current COVID-19 pandemic has strained medical resources, creating a dilemma for physicians charged with a responsibility to limit spread of the contagion, and their responsibility to treat the patients they are entrusted to care for.
32259247,To address these issues, an expert panel was convened that included pain management experts from the military, Veterans Health Administration, and academia.
32259247,Endorsement from stakeholder societies was sought upon completion of the document, with a 1-week suspense period.
32259247,In these guidelines, we provide a framework for pain practitioners and institutions to balance the often-conflicting goals of risk mitigation for health care providers, risk mitigation for patients, conservation of resources, and access to pain management services.
32259247,Specific issues discussed include general and interventional-specific risk mitigation, patient flow issues and staffing plans, telemedicine options, triaging recommendations, strategies to reduce psychological sequelae in health care providers, and resource utilization.
32259247,The COVID-19 public health crisis has strained health care systems, creating a conundrum for patients, pain medicine practitioners, hospital leaders, and regulatory officials.
32259247,Although this document provides a framework for pain management services, systems-wide and individual decisions must take into account clinical considerations, regional health conditions, government and hospital directives, resource availability, the welfare of health care providers.
32259247,Video-Abstract link: https://vimeo.com/houpla/review/403517991/6a15e5ff38.
32259288,Chronic pain causes significant suffering, limitation of daily activities and reduced quality of life.
32259288,Infection from COVID-19 is responsible for an ongoing pandemic that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome, leading to systemic complications and death.
32259288,Led by the World Health Organization, healthcare systems across the world are engaged in limiting the spread of infection.
32259288,As a result all elective surgeries, procedures, and patient visits, including pain management services, have been postponed or cancelled.
32259288,This has impacted the care of chronic pain patients.
32259288,Most are elderly with multiple comorbidities, which puts them at risk of COVID-19 infection.
32259288,Important considerations that need to be recognised during this pandemic for chronic pain patients include: ensuring continuity of care and pain medications, especially opioids; use of telemedicine; maintaining biopsychosocial management; use of anti-inflammatory drugs; use of steroids; and prioritising necessary procedural visits.
32259288,There are no guidelines to inform physicians and healthcare providers engaged in caring for patients with pain during this period of crisis.
32259288,We assembled an expert panel of pain physicians, psychologists and researchers from North America and Europe to formulate recommendations to guide practice.
32259288,As the COVID-19 situation continues to evolve rapidly, these recommendations are based on the best available evidence and expert opinion at this present time and may need adapting to local workplace policies.
32259313,The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has evolved into an emergent global pandemic.
32259313,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can manifest on a spectrum of illness from mild disease to severe respiratory failure requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission.
32259313,As the incidence continues to rise at a rapid pace, critical care teams are faced with challenging treatment decisions.
32259313,There is currently no widely accepted standard of care in the pharmacological management of patients with COVID-19.
32259313,Urgent identification of potential treatment strategies is a priority.
32259313,Therapies include novel agents available in clinical trials or through compassionate use, and other drugs, repurposed antiviral and immune modulating therapies.
32259313,Many have demonstrated in vitro or in vivo potential against other viruses that are similar to SARS-CoV-2.
32259313,Critically ill patients with COVID-19 have additional considerations related to adjustments for organ impairment and renal replacement therapies, complex lists of concurrent medications, limitations with drug administration and compatibility, and unique toxicities that should be evaluated when utilizing these therapies.
32259313,The purpose of this review is to summarize practical considerations for pharmacotherapy in patients with COVID-19, with the intent of serving as a resource for health care providers at the forefront of clinical care during this pandemic.
32259477,The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in China and rapidly spread worldwide.
32259477,To prevent SARS-CoV-2 dissemination, understanding the in vivo characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 is a high priority.
32259477,We report a ferret model of SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission that recapitulates aspects of human disease.
32259477,SARS-CoV-2-infected ferrets exhibit elevated body temperatures and virus replication.
32259477,Although fatalities were not observed, SARS-CoV-2-infected ferrets shed virus in nasal washes, saliva, urine, and feces up to 8 days post-infection.
32259477,At 2 days post-contact, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in all naive direct contact ferrets.
32259477,Furthermore, a few naive indirect contact ferrets were positive for viral RNA, suggesting airborne transmission.
32259477,Viral antigens were detected in nasal turbinate, trachea, lungs, and intestine with acute bronchiolitis present in infected lungs.
32259477,Thus, ferrets represent an infection and transmission animal model of COVID-19 that may facilitate development of SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics and vaccines.
32259899,Approximately 90 days of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) spreading originally from Wuhan, China, and across the globe has led to a widespread chain of events with imminent threats to the fragile relationship between community health and economic health.
32259899,Despite near hourly reporting on this crisis, there has been no regular, updated, or accurate reporting of hospitalizations for COVID-19.
32259899,It is known that many test-positive individuals may not develop symptoms or have a mild self-limited viral syndrome consisting of fever, malaise, dry cough, and constitutional symptoms.
32259899,However some individuals develop a more fulminant syndrome including viral pneumonia, respiratory failure requiring oxygen, acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring mechanical ventilation, and in substantial fractions leading to death attributable to COVID-19.
32259899,The pandemic is evolving in a clustered, non-inform fashion resulting in many hospitals with preparedness but few or no cases, and others that are completely overwhelmed.
32259899,Thus, a considerable risk of spread when personal protection equipment becomes exhausted and a large fraction of mortality in those not offered mechanical ventilation are both attributable to a crisis due to maldistribution of resources.
32259899,The pandemic is amenable to self-reporting through a mobile phone application that could obtain critical information on suspected cases and report on the results of self testing and actions taken.
32259899,The only method to understand the clustering and the immediate hospital resource needs is mandatory, uniform, daily reporting of hospital censuses of COVID-19 cases admitted to hospital wards and intensive care units.
32259899,Current reports of hospitalizations are delayed, uncertain, and wholly inadequate.
32259899,This paper urges all the relevant stakeholders to take up self-reporting and reporting of hospitalizations of COVID-19 as an urgent task in combating this devastating pandemic.
32264666,As it is known, we are all in a pandemic situation due to a novel coronavirus, officially named &quot;Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2&quot; and the disease caused by the virus named &quot;Coronavirus disease-2019&quot;.
32264666,The virus seems to has propensity to infect older male individuals with underlying disease.
32264666,The clinical features were on a large scale that varies from being an asymptomatic carrier to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan dysfunction.
32264666,Fever, dry cough and fatigue are the most common symptoms.
32264666,Not only, the disease seems to be rare and have a milder course in pediatric age but also respiratory failure, multiorgan dysfunction, and death are extremely rare.
32264666,Although several comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases are defined as a risk factor for developing the acute respiratory syndrome and need for intensive care; immune-compromised situations such as rheumatic disease which require immunosuppressive treatment strikingly are not found to be a risk factor for more severe disease course.
32264666,However, there is a lack of data regarding the effects of &quot;Coronavirus disease-2019&quot; on pediatric patients with rheumatic diseases.
32264666,Additionally, there are three controversial circumstances that patients with rheumatic diseases are believed to be more likely to have viral infections like &quot;Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2&quot;, on the other hand, antirheumatic drugs may have a protective and therapeutic role in Coronavirus disease-2019 and children are more unlikely to have serious disease course.
32264666,Therefore, we aimed to have a contributor role for explaining this conundrum and present a bird's eye view regarding this equivocal issue in this review.
32264908,The COVID-19 pandemic is challenging modern radiation oncology.
32264908,At University Hospitals, we have a mandate to offer high-end treatments to all cancer patients.
32264908,However, in times of crisis we must learn to prioritize resources, especially personnel.
32264908,Compromising oncological outcome will blur all statistics, therefore all measures must be taken with great caution.
32264908,Communication with our neighboring countries, within societies and between departments can help meet the challenge.
32264908,Here, we report on our learning system and preparation measures to effectively tackle the COVID-19 challenge in University-Based Radiation Oncology Departments.
32265182,On the 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that COVID-19 was a pandemic.
32265182,To date, there are no medical treatments for COVID-19 with proven effectiveness.
32265182,Novel treatments and/or vaccines will take time to be developed and distributed to patients.
32265182,In light of this, there has been growing interest in the use of existing medications, such as chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), as potential treatments of this disease.
32265182,To establish the current evidence for the effectiveness of CQ and HCQ in treating COVID-19.
32265182,A rapid review of the literature was conducted.
32265182,Electronic searches in PubMed and Google Scholar were conducted on 21 March 2020.
32265182,A further search was conducted in Google for relevant literature on 28 March 2020.
32265182,There is limited evidence of in vitro activity of CQ/HCQ against SARS-CoV-2.
32265182,A number of in vivo clinical trials are underway.
32265182,The empirical data available from two of these trials reveal conflicting results.
32265182,Both trials are characterised by small numbers of participants (<i>n</i> = 30 and <i>n</i> = 36) and suffer methodological limitations.
32265182,No medium or long-term follow-up data is available.
32265182,At present, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether CQ/HCQ are safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
32265182,High quality, adequately powered randomised clinical trials in primary and secondary care settings are urgently required to guide policymakers and clinicians.
32265182,These studies should report medium- and long-term follow-up results, and safety data.
32265310,Severe respiratory consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic have prompted urgent need for novel therapies.
32265310,Cell-based approaches, primarily using mesenchymal stem (stromal) cells (MSCs), have demonstrated safety and possible efficacy in patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), although not as yet well studied in respiratory virus-induced ARDS.
32265310,Limited pre-clinical data suggest that systemic MSC administration can significantly reduce respiratory virus (Influenza strains H5N1 and H9N2)-induced lung injury, however, there are no available data in models of coronavirus respiratory infection.There are a rapidly increasing number of clinical investigations of cell-based therapy approaches for COVID-19.
32265310,These utilise a range of different cell sources, doses, dosing strategies, and targeted patient populations.
32265310,To provide a rationale strategy to maximise potential therapeutic use, it is critically important to understand the relevant pre-clinical studies and postulated mechanisms of MSC actions in respiratory virus-induced lung injuries.
32265310,These are presented along with consideration of current clinical investigations.
32265848,Seven coronaviruses (CoVs) have been isolated from humans so far.
32265848,Among them, three emerging pathogenic CoVs, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and a newly identified CoV (2019-nCoV), once caused or continue to cause severe infections in humans, posing significant threats to global public health.
32265848,SARS-CoV infection in humans (with about 10% case fatality rate) was first reported from China in 2002, while MERS-CoV infection in humans (with about 34.4% case fatality rate) was first reported from Saudi Arabia in June 2012. 2019-nCoV was first reported from China in December 2019, and is currently infecting more than 70000 people (with about 2.7% case fatality rate).
32265848,Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are zoonotic viruses, using bats as their natural reservoirs, and then transmitting through intermediate hosts, leading to human infections.
32265848,Nevertheless, the intermediate host for 2019-nCoV is still under investigation and the vaccines against this new CoV have not been available.
32265848,Although a variety of vaccines have been developed against infections of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, none of them has been approved for use in humans.
32265848,In this review, we have described the structure and function of key proteins of emerging human CoVs, overviewed the current vaccine types to be developed against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and summarized recent advances in subunit vaccines against these two pathogenic human CoVs.
32265848,These subunit vaccines are introduced on the basis of full-length spike (S) protein, receptor-binding domain (RBD), non-RBD S protein fragments, and non-S structural proteins, and the potential factors affecting these subunit vaccines are also illustrated.
32265848,Overall, this review will be helpful for rapid design and development of vaccines against the new 2019-nCoV and any future CoVs with pandemic potential.
32265848,This review was written for the topic of <i>Antivirals for Emerging Viruses: Vaccines and Therapeutics</i> in the <i>Virology</i> section of <i>Frontiers in Microbiology</i>.
32266381,We report the observation that 14.5% of COVID-19 patients had positive RT-PCR testing again after discharge.
32266381,We describe correlations between laboratory parameters and treatment duration (r= -0.637; p=0.002) and time to virus recrudescence (r= 0.52; p=0.008) respectively, suggesting the need for additional measures to confirm illness resolution in COVID-19 patients.
32266708,Cardiovascular diseases, in particular hypertension, as well as the cardiovascular treatment with Renin-Angiotensin System inhibitors such as Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs), are claimed once again as mechanisms of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) during the COVID-19 outbreak due to Cov-2 epidemics.
32266708,In vitro studies are available to support the eventual role of ACE inhibitors and ARBs in both the promotion and antagonism of the disease.
32266708,The available literature, indeed, presents contrasting results, all concentrated in experimental models.
32266708,Evidence in humans is lacking that those mechanisms are actually occurring in the present COVID-19 outbreak.
32266708,Here we present the reasoned statement of the Italian Society of Hypertension to maintain ongoing antihypertensive treatments.
32266708,Furthermore, the Italian Society of Hypertension presents its own initiative to investigate the issue using an online questionnaire to collect relevant data in human disease.
32266987,To assess the efficacy of corticosteroid treatment of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32266987,Observational study in the two COVID-19-designated hospitals in Wuhu, Anhui province, China, 24 January - 24 February 2020.
32266987,Thirty-one patients infected with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) treated at the two designated hospitals.
32266987,Virus clearance time, length of hospital stay, and duration of symptoms, by treatment type (including or not including corticosteroid therapy).
32266987,Eleven of 31 patients with COVID-19 received corticosteroid treatment.
32266987,Cox proportional hazards regression analysis indicated no association between corticosteroid treatment and virus clearance time (hazard ratio [HR], 1.26; 95% CI, 0.58-2.74), hospital length of stay (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.33-1.78), or duration of symptoms (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.40-1.83).
32266987,Univariate analysis indicated that virus clearance was slower in two patients with chronic hepatitis B infections (mean difference, 10.6 days; 95% CI, 6.2-15.1 days).
32266987,Corticosteroids are widely used when treating patients with COVID-19, but we found no association between therapy and outcomes in patients without acute respiratory distress syndrome.
32266987,An existing HBV infection may delay SARS-CoV-2 clearance, and this association should be further investigated.
32266994,We read with great interest the article by Cheng H et al.
32266994,The authors mentioned that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is protective against novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32266994,We would like to explain how cytosolic pH increases the COVID-19 infection by affecting the ACE2.
32266994,In addition, we would like to mention that amiloride, which increases the cytosolic pH, can be used in the COVID-19 treatment.

32267109,The international community is currently facing a pandemic of acute respiratory syndrome caused by a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2.
32267109,This syndrome has been named COVID-19 for CoronaVIrus Disease 2019 by the World Health Organization.
32267109,The starting point of the epidemic is the city of Wuhan (China), where the virus is said to have been transmitted from animals to humans before inter-human transmission.
32267109,This is the third epidemic caused by a coronavirus after those of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) started in 2012.
32267109,COVID-19 has rapidly spread to China and is currently spreading all over the world.
32267109,The infection mainly affects patients over 40 years of age and mortality is increased in the presence of comorbidities.
32267109,Children are pauci- or asymptomatic.
32267109,The diagnosis is most often based on the detection of the viral genome in the nasopharynx by molecular biology methods.
32267109,In the absence of specific anti-viral molecules, treatment is currently mainly symptomatic.
32267109,It is clear that the COVID-19 pandemic is more difficult to control than what the first data suggested.
32267109,The key strategy to SARS-CoV-2 is to limit its transmission.
32267109,Preventive measures are mainly based on the application of adequate hand hygiene measures and disinfection of the environment, as well as measures of social distance aimed at limiting contacts in the population and protecting populations at risk.
32267109,La communauté internationale fait actuellement face à une pandémie de syndrome respiratoire aigu due à un nouveau coronavirus, le SARS-CoV-2.
32267109,Ce syndrome a été nommé COVID-19 pour COronaVIrus Disease 2019 par l’Organisation Mondiale de la Santé.
32267109,Le point de départ de l’épidémie est la ville de Wuhan (Chine), où le virus aurait été transmis de l’animal à l’homme préalablement à la transmission inter-humaine.
32267109,Il s’agit de la 3ème épidé¬mie causée par un coronavirus après celles du syndrome respiratoire aigu sévère (SARS) en 2003 et du syndrome respiratoire du Moyen-Orient (MERS) débutée en 2012.
32267109,Le COVID-19 s’est rapidement propagé en Chine et se répand actuellement à travers le monde entier.
32267109,L’infection touche surtout les patients de plus de 40 ans et la mortalité est accrue en présence de comorbidités.
32267109,Les enfants sont, quant à eux, pauci- ou asymptomatiques.
32267109,Le diagnostic repose, le plus souvent, sur la détection du génome viral au niveau du nasopharynx par des méthodes de biologie moléculaire.
32267109,En l’absence de molécules anti-virales spéci¬fiques, le traitement reste, à l’heure actuelle, principalement symptomatique.
32267109,Force est de constater que la pandémie de COVID-19 est plus difficile à contrôler que ce que les premières données ne laissaient présager.
32267109,L’élément clé face au SARS-CoV-2 est de limiter sa transmission.
32267109,Les mesures de prévention reposent, principalement, sur l’application de mesures d’hygiène des mains adéquates et la désinfection de l’environnement, ainsi que sur des mesures de distance sociale visant à limiter les contacts dans la population et à protéger les populations à risque.
32267139,Brain metastasis is a major cause for cancer death in patients with lung cancer.
32267139,Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and hsa-miR-217 has been identified to mediate the development of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
32267139,We performed this study to investigate the roles of hsa-miR-217, its target SIRT1, as well as P53/KAI1 axis in the brain metastasis from NSCLC.
32267139,This is a cell culture study.
32267139,Human pulmonary adenocarcinoma brain metastasis cell line PC-14/B were incubated and treated with constructed lentiviral plasmids expressing miR-217 and/or SIRT1.
32267139,BEAS-2B cell line was used as a control.
32267139,The targeted regulation of miR-217 to SIRT1 was examined using dual luciferase reporter assay.
32267139,Cell proliferation, migration, invasion and the expression of relate proteins were detected to examine the effect of miR-217/SIRT1 expression on metastasis.
32267139,PC-14/B cells expressed higher SIRT1 and lower p53 and KAI1 compared with BEAS-2B control cells (P&lt;0.05).
32267139,SIRT1 was a direct target of miR-217.
32267139,MiR-217 expression suppressed PC-14/B cell invasion (P=0.004), migration (P=0.001) and proliferation (P&lt;0.05), whereas SIRT1 overexpression reversed all processes.
32267139,SIRT1 expression inhibited P53, KAI1/CD82, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and β-catenin but upregulated E-cadherin protein.
32267139,MiR-217 overexpression induced reverse changes.
32267139,Hsa-miR-217 and its target SIRT1 acted as metastasis suppressor and promoter gene in NSCLC, respectively.
32267139,The hsa-miR-217/SIRT1/P53/KAI1 metastasis regulatory pathway showed novel and crucial roles in brain metastasis from NSCLC.
32267139,This axis might be a potential target for the treatment of brain metastasis of lung cancer.
32267556,We are living in unprecedented times.
32267556,While we had near pandemic events in the recent past with SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome), we have never experienced anything like coronavirus (COVID-19), also known as SARS-CoV-2 infection, since the Spanish flu.
32267556,In contrast to the Spanish flu where medical care was limited, we are equipped to combat COVID-19 but there is considerable work ahead with many uncertainties.
32267556,At this critical time, we must come together as one united country and world to stop the spread and provide the best care possible for individuals who contract the virus and develop infection.
32267556,A number of novel and repurposed therapies agents with activity against SARS-CoV-2 have been identified and most institutions have developed clinical pathways to operationalize their use in appropriate COVID-19 patients.<sup>1-3</sup> However, optimal drug therapy decisions for those with moderate to severe COVID-19 infections are extremely challenging at this time as evidence is limited.
32267560,Current coronavirus pandemic named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32267560,SARS-CoV-2 is the third coronavirus outbreak during the current century after severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses.<sup>1</sup> Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is an immunopathologic event and main cause of death following COVID-19.
32267560,The main mechanism of ARDS is uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response and cytokine storm following release of proinflammatory cytokines (such as interferons (IFN), interleukines (IL), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α) and chemokines.<sup>2-3</sup> So, some Chinese researchers proposed or used anti-inflammatory agents in the treatment regimen of patients with COVID-19.<sup>3-4</sup>.
32267566,Currently there is a race against time to identify prophylactic and therapeutic treatments against COVID-19.
32267566,Until these treatments are developed, tested and mass produced, it might be prudent to look into existing therapies that could be effective against this virus.
32267566,Based on the available evidence we believe that tetracyclines may be effective agents in the treatment of COVID-19.
32267566,Tetracyclines (e.g. tetracycline, doxycycline, and minocycline) are highly lipophilic antibiotics that are known to chelate zinc compounds on matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)<sup>1</sup> .
32267566,Coronaviruses are also known to heavily rely on host MMPs for survival, cell infiltration, cell to cell adhesion, and replication, many of which have zinc as part of their MMP complex<sup>2,3</sup> .
32267566,It is possible that the zinc chelating properties of tetracyclines may also aid in inhibiting COVID-19 infection in humans limiting their ability to replicate within the host.
32267771,There is broad interest in improved methods to generate robust evidence regarding best practice, especially in settings where patient conditions are heterogenous and require multiple concomitant therapies.
32267771,Here, we present the rationale and design of a large, international trial that combines features of adaptive platform trials with pragmatic point-of-care trials to determine best treatment strategies for patients admitted to an intensive care unit with severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).
32267771,The trial uses a novel design entitled a randomized embedded multifactorial adaptive platform (REMAP).
32267771,The design has 5 key features: i.) randomization, allowing robust causal inference; ii.) embedding of study procedures into routine care processes, facilitating enrollment, trial efficiency, and generalizability; iii.) a multifactorial statistical model comparing multiple interventions across multiple patient subgroups; iv.) response-adaptive randomization with preferential assignment to those interventions that appear most favorable, and v.) a platform structured to permit continuous, potentially perpetual enrollment beyond the evaluation of the initial treatments.
32267771,The trial randomizes patients to multiple interventions within 4 treatment domains: antibiotics, antiviral therapy for influenza, host immunomodulation with extended macrolide therapy, and alternative corticosteroid regimens, representing 240 treatment regimens.
32267771,The trial generates estimates of superiority, inferiority and equivalence between regimens on the primary outcome of 90-day mortality, stratified by presence or absence of concomitant shock and proven or suspected influenza infection.
32267771,The trial will also compare ventilatory and oxygenation strategies and has capacity to address additional questions rapidly during pandemic respiratory infections.
32267771,As of January 2020, REMAP-CAP was approved and enrolling patients in 52 ICUs in 13 countries in 3 continents.
32267771,In February, it transitioned into pandemic mode with several design adaptations for COVID-19 disease.
32267771,Lessons learned from the design and conduct of this trial should aid in dissemination of similar platform initiatives in other disease areas.
32267771,Clinical trial registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02735707).
32267987,The beginning of 2020 has seen the emergence of COVID-19, an outbreak caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, an important pathogen for humans.
32267987,There is an urgent need to better understand this new virus and to develop ways to control its spread.
32267987,In Iran, the first case of the COVID-19 was reported after spread from China and other countries.
32267987,Fever, cough, and fatigue were the most common symptoms of this virus.
32267987,In worldwide, the incubation period of COVID-19 was 3 to 7 days and approximately 80% of infections are mild or asymptomatic, 15% are severe, requiring oxygen, and 5% are critical infections, requiring ventilation.
32267987,To mount an antiviral response, the innate immune system recognizes molecular structures that are produced by the invasion of the virus.
32267987,COVID-19 infection induces IgG antibodies against N protein that can be detected by serum as early as day 4 after the onset of disease and with most patients seroconverting by day 14.
32267987,Laboratory evidence of clinical patients showed that a specific T-cell response against SARS-CoV-2 is important for the recognition and killing of infected cells, particularly in the lungs of infected individuals.
32267987,At present, there is no specific antiviral therapy for COVID-19 and the main treatments are supportive.
32267987,In this review, we investigated the innate and acquired immune responses in patients who recovered from COVID-19, which could inform the design of prophylactic vaccines and immunotherapy for the future.
32267998,A hallmark of severe COVID-19 is coagulopathy, with 71.4% of patients who die of COVID-19 meeting ISTH criteria for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) while only 0.6% of patients who survive meet these criteria (1).
32267998,Additionally, it has become clear that this is not a bleeding diathesis but rather a predominantly pro-thrombotic DIC with high venous thromboembolism rates, elevated D-dimer levels, high fibrinogen levels in concert with low anti-thrombin levels, and pulmonary congestion with microvascular thrombosis and occlusion on pathology in addition to mounting experience with high rates of central line thrombosis and vascular occlusive events (e.g. ischemic limbs, strokes, etc.) observed by those who care for critically ill COVID-19 patients (1-7).
32267998,There is evidence in both animals and humans that fibrinolytic therapy in Acute Lung Injury and ARDS improves survival, which also points to fibrin deposition in the pulmonary microvasculature as a contributory cause of ARDS and would be expected to be seen in patients with ARDS and concomitant diagnoses of DIC on their laboratory values such as what is observed in more than 70% of those who die of COVID-19 (8-10).
32268005,In less than six months, COVID-19 has spread from a marketplace in Wuhan, China to over 150 countries and territories of the world.
32268005,Therapeutics are desperately needed to reduce the morbidity and mortality of this pandemic disease.
32268005,It has been reported that hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is active against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, and this finding was quickly supported by an open label non-randomized clinical trial that provided the first published clinical evidence HCQ may be a treatment option.
32268018,To analysis the medication characteristics of the prescriptions issued via open channel by the National and Provincial Health Committee and the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine in treating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32268018,We collected the data of traditional Chinese medicine related to treatment plans published by the National and Provincial Health Committee and the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine from the start of COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan to February 19, 2020.
32268018,The frequency analysis, cluster analysis and correlation analysis were performed.
32268018,The study collected 4 national and 34 regional prevention and treatment plans, 578 items, 84 traditional Chinese formulations, 60 Chinese patent medicines, and 230 Chinese herbs.
32268018,The high frequently used herbs were <i>Liquorice</i>, <i>Scutellariabaicalensis</i>, <i>Semen armeniacaeamarae</i>, and <i>Gypsum</i>.
32268018,The commonly used traditional formulations included <i>Maxing Shigan</i> Decoction, <i>Yin Qiao</i> Powder, and <i>Xuanbai Chengqi</i> Decoction.
32268018,The Chinese patent drugs included <i>Angong Niuhuang</i> Pill, <i>Xuebijing</i> Injection, and <i>Lianhua Qingwen</i> Capsule.
32268018,The most common paired medications were <i>Ephedra</i> and <i>Semen armeniacaeamarae</i>, <i>Fructusforsythiae</i> and <i>Liquorice</i>.
32268018,Two core combinations and one novel formula were discovered in the study. <i>Yin Qiao</i> Powder and <i>Huopo Xialing</i> Decoction are the basic formulations for <i>Weifen</i> syndrome of COVID-19.
32268018,In addition, <i>Maxing Shigan</i> Decoction, <i>Liang Ge</i> Powder, <i>Qingwen Baidu</i> Decoction and <i>Da Yuan</i> Decoction are the basic formulations for <i>Qifen</i> syndrome of COVID-19.
32268018,The main medication characteristics are clearing heat, entilating lung, removing toxicity and removing turbidity.
32268018,It shows that removing toxicity and eliminating evil are the prescription thought in treating epidemic disease of traditional Chinese medicine.
32268019,Acute respiratory failure due to acute hypoxemia is the major manifestation in severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection.
32268019,Rational and effective respiratory support is crucial in the management of COVID-19 patients.
32268019,High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) has been utilized widely due to its superiority over other non-invasive respiratory support techniques.
32268019,To avoid HFNC failure and intubation delay, the key issues are proper patients, timely application and improving compliance.
32268019,It should be noted that elder patients are vulnerable for failed HFNC.
32268019,We applied HFNC for oxygen therapy in severe and critical COVID-19 patients and summarized the following experiences.
32268019,Firstly, to select the proper size of nasal catheter, to locate it at suitable place, and to confirm the nose and the upper respiratory airway unobstructed.
32268019,Secondly, an initial flow of 60 L/min and 37℃ should be given immediately for patients with obvious respiratory distress or weak cough ability; otherwise, low-level support should be given first and the level gradually increased.
32268019,Thirdly, to avoid hypoxia or hypoxemia, the treatment goal of HFNC should be maintained the oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) above 95% for patients without chronic pulmonary disease.
32268019,Finally, patients should wear a surgical mask during HFNC treatment to reduce the risk of virus transmission through droplets or aerosols.
32268454,<b>Objective:</b> To introduce Treatment experience of burn patients combined with inhalation injury during epidemic period of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). <b>Methods:</b> Six burn patients combined with inhalation injury were hospitalized in Department of Burns of Tongren Hospital of Wuhan University&amp; Wuhan Third Hospital from February 1 to March 1 in 2020duringhigh-incidence period of COVID-19, including 4 males and 2 females, aged 21-63 years, hospitalized for 2-4 hours, with total burn areas of 1%-20% TBSA and full-thickness burn areas of 1%-12% TBSA.
32268454,Among them, 1 case was severe inhalation injury, 2 cases were mild inhalation injury, and 3 cases were moderate inhalation injury.
32268454,The body temperatures of the patients were normal at admission without fever or cough in the past 2 weeks.
32268454,At admission, chest CT of one patient showed double lower lobes and left upper lobes had multiple slices and slightly high-density shadow of nodules.
32268454,Chest CT of two patients showed bilateral lung texture was thickening, and chest CT of other patients was normal.
32268454,After admission, 6 patients were given routine treatment, the medical staffs paid attention to the protection and screened COVID-19 according to the diagnosis and treatment plan of COVID-19.
32268454,On post injury day (PID) 1, 3, 6, and 9, vein blood of patients were collected for determination of white blood cell (WBC) count, neutrophil, lymphocyte absolute value. and level of procalcitonin (PCT).
32268454,Nucleic acid of novel coronavirus was detected by real-time fluorescence reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction on PID 3 and 6.
32268454,The temperatures of patients were recorded after admission.
32268454,The results of chest CT within one week after injury and the prognosis of the patients were recorded.
32268454,Measurement data distributed normally were expressed as <i>x</i> ± s, and measurement data distributed abnormally were expressed as M <i>(P(25), P(75))</i>. <b>Results:</b> (1) On PID1, 3, 6, and 9, WBC counts of patients were respectively (19.8±3.8)×10(9)/L, (17.2±3.4)×10(9)/L,(13.3±3.1)×10(9)/L, and (11.1±1.6)×10(9)/L, neutrophils of patients were respectively0.919±0.019,0.899±0.011, 0.855±0.034, and0.811±0.035, absolute values of lymphocytes of patients were respectively(0.65±0.18)×10(9)/L,(0.65±0.24)×10(9)/L,(0.91±0.34)×10(9)/L, and (1.23±0.42)×10(9)/L,and PCT values of patients were respectively0.49 (0.36, 1.64), 0.39 (0.26, 0.73), 0.28 (0.18, 0.33), and 0.12 (0.11, 0.20) ng/mL.The values of WBC and neutrophils of patients were higher than the normal value, showing a downward trend.
32268454,The absolute values of lymphocyte of patients returned to the normal value gradually.
32268454,The PCT values of patients were higher than the normal value.
32268454,(2) Nucleic acid test results of novel coronavirus of 6 patients were negative on PID 3 and 6.
32268454,The temperatures of patients were from 36.5 to 38.6 ℃.
32268454,The typical imaging features of COVID-19 were not found in 6 patients within 1 week after injury by chest CT.
32268454,After treatment for 14-32 days, 6 patients were cured and discharged. <b>Conclusions:</b> During the novel coronavirus, burn patients combined with inhalation injury should be treated under condition of good protection for COVID-19 among doctors and nurses.

32268515,Previous studies reported that Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the main cell receptor of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
32268515,It plays a key role in the access of the virus into the cell to produce the final infection.
32268515,In the present study we investigated in silico the basic mechanism of <i>ACE2</i> in the lung and provided evidences for new potentially effective drugs for Covid-19.
32268515,Specifically, we used the gene expression profiles from public datasets including The Cancer Genome Atlas, Gene Expression Omnibus and Genotype-Tissue Expression, Gene Ontology and pathway enrichment analysis to investigate the main functions of <i>ACE2</i>-correlated genes.
32268515,We constructed a protein-protein interaction network containing the genes co-expressed with <i>ACE2</i>.
32268515,Finally, we focused on the genes in the network that are already associated with known drugs and evaluated their role for a potential treatment of Covid-19.
32268515,Our results demonstrate that the genes correlated with <i>ACE2</i> are mainly enriched in the sterol biosynthetic process, Aryldialkylphosphatase activity, adenosylhomocysteinase activity, trialkylsulfonium hydrolase activity, acetate-CoA and CoA ligase activity.
32268515,We identified a network of 193 genes, 222 interactions and 36 potential drugs that could have a crucial role.
32268515,Among possible interesting drugs for Covid-19 treatment, we found Nimesulide, Fluticasone Propionate, Thiabendazole, Photofrin, Didanosine and Flutamide.
32268641,This guideline is applicable to the health protection requirements of large indoor stadiums which are reconstructed as treatment sites for COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms during the outbreak.
32268641,Focusing on the health emergency scenario of severe virus infectious diseases and atypical places where COVID-19 patients with mild symptom gather, from perspectives of functional zones, hygiene facilities, personal protection, and management system, health risk protection recommendations and countermeasures are comprehensively proposed to mainly protect staffs and surrounding environment.
32268641,The implementation of this guideline will provide technique support for emergency requirements of indoor stadiums reconstructed as mobile cabin hospitals.

32268719,Severe COVID-19 illness is characterised by the development of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), for which the mainstay of treatment is represented by mechanical ventilation.
32268719,Mortality associated with ARDS due to other causes is in the range of 40-60%, but currently available data are not yet sufficient to draw safe conclusions on the prognosis of COVID-19 patients who require mechanical ventilation.
32268719,Based on data from cohorts of the related coronavirus-associated illnesses, that is to say Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), prognosis would seem to be worse than ARDS due to other causes such as trauma and other infections.
32268719,Discussion of prognosis is central to obtaining informed consent for intubation, but in the absence of definitive data it is not clear exactly what this discussion should entail.
32268923,A new type of coronavirus, novel coronavirus (COVID-19), is causing an increasing number of cases of pneumonia and was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization on 30 January 2020.
32268923,The virus first appeared in Wuhan, China, in late December 2019, and traditional Chinese herbal medicine is being used for its treatment.
32268923,This systematic review and meta-analysis will assess studies of the effects of traditional Chinese herbal medicine in COVID-19 pneumonia.
32268923,We will search electronic databases including PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database (VIP), and Wanfang database using keywords related to COVID-19 and traditional Chinese herbal medicine.
32268923,Reference lists of relevant trials and reviews will be searched.
32268923,We will manually search gray literature, such as conference proceedings and academic degree dissertations, and trial registries.
32268923,Two independent reviewers will screen studies (XL and DZ), extract data (YL and LG), and evaluate risk of bias (YL and DZ).
32268923,Data analysis will be conducted using the Review Manager software (version 5.3.5) and R software (version 3.6.1).
32268923,Statistical heterogeneity will be assessed using a standard chi-square test with a significance level of P &lt; 0.10.
32268923,Biases associated with study size (e.g., publication bias) will be investigated using funnel plots, Egger's test and Begg's test, and Trim and Fill analysis.
32268923,This study will provide a high-quality synthesis of the effects of traditional Chinese herbal medicine for COVID-19.
32268923,The use of traditional Chinese herbal medicine for treatment or prevention of these novel viral infections affecting the pneumonia will be investigated.
32268923,PROSPERO registration number: CRD42020168004.
32269064,As the COVID-19 pandemic took hold in North America, rheumatology clinics across the continent were inundated with phone calls from lupus patients understandably fearful of COVID-19.
32269064,One of the most common questions from patients was whether they should stop taking their lupus medications.
32269087,Previous studies described the clinical features of Covid-19 in adults and infants under 1 year of age.
32269087,Little is known about features, outcomes and intrauterine transmission potential in newborn babies aged 28 days or less.
32269087,Through systematical searching, we identified 4 infections in newborn babies in China as of March 13.
32269087,The age range was 30 h to 17 days old.
32269087,Three were male.
32269087,Two newborn babies had fever, 1 had shortness of breath, 1 had cough and 1 had no syndromes.
32269087,Supportive treatment was provided for all 4 newborn babies.
32269087,None required intensive unit care or mechanical ventilation.
32269087,None had any severe complications.
32269087,Three newborn babies recovered by the end of this study and had been discharged with 16, 23, and 30 days of hospital stay.
32269087,All 4 mothers were infected by SARS-CoV-2, 3 showing symptoms before and 1 after delivery.
32269087,Cesarean section was used for all 4 mothers, 3 at level III hospitals and 1 at a level II hospital.
32269087,Three newborn babies were separated from mothers right after being born and were not breastfed.
32269087,In summary, newborn babies are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32269087,The symptoms in newborn babies were milder and outcomes were less severe as compared to adults.
32269087,Intrauterine vertical transmission is possible but direct evidence is still lacking.
32269597,On Monday, 23 March 2020, Nigeria recorded its first mortality from the novel global COVID-19 outbreak.
32269597,Before this, the country reported 36 confirmed cases (at the time of writing) and has discharged home two cases after weeks of care at a government-approved isolation centre in Lagos State.
32269597,This first mortality was that of a 67-year-old man with a history of multiple myeloma, a type of blood cancer.
32269597,He was undergoing chemotherapy and had just returned to Nigeria following medical treatment in the United Kingdom.
32269597,The novel COVID-19 pandemic has grounded several global activities including the provision of health care services to people with chronic conditions such as cancer.
32269597,Evidence from China suggests that cancer patients with COVID-19 infection are a vulnerable group, with a higher risk of severe illness resulting in intensive care unit admissions or death, particularly if they received chemotherapy or surgery.
32269597,This letter is an attempt to suggest practicable interventions such as the use of existing digital health platforms to limit patients' and oncology professionals' physical interactions as a way of reducing the risk of COVID-19 infection transmission amongst cancer patients and oncologists, as well as outlining effective strategies to ensure that cancer care is not completely disrupted during the outbreak.
32269598,There have been several reports noting anosmia and ageusia as possible symptoms of COVID-19.
32269598,This is of particular interest in oncology since patients receiving some cancer treatments such as chemotherapy or immune therapy often experience similar symptoms as side-effects.
32269598,The purpose of this report was to summarise the evidence on the existence of anosmia and ageusia an emerging COVID-19 symptoms in order to better inform both oncology patients and clinicians.
32269598,Currently, there is no published evidence or case reports noting anosmia or ageusia as symptoms of COVID-19.
32269598,Nevertheless, experts in rhinology have suggested that the onset of such symptoms could either act as a trigger for testing for the disease where possible, or could be a new criterion to self-isolate.
32269598,Whilst more data is currently needed to strengthen our knowledge of the symptoms of COVID-19, oncology patients who are concerned about anosmia or ageusia in the context of their systemic anti-cancer therapy should contact their acute oncology support line for advice.
32269766,<b>Background:</b> The newly identified coronavirus known as 2019-nCoV has posed a serious global health threat.
32269766,According to the latest report (18-February-2020), it has infected more than 72,000 people globally and led to deaths of more than 1,016 people in China. <b>Methods:</b> The 2019 novel coronavirus proteome was aligned to a curated database of viral immunogenic peptides.
32269766,The immunogenicity of detected peptides and their binding potential to HLA alleles was predicted by immunogenicity predictive models and NetMHCpan 4.0. <b>Results:</b> We report <i>in silico</i> identification of a comprehensive list of immunogenic peptides that can be used as potential targets for 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) vaccine development.
32269766,First, we found 28 nCoV peptides identical to Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS CoV) that have previously been characterized immunogenic by T cell assays.
32269766,Second, we identified 48 nCoV peptides having a high degree of similarity with immunogenic peptides deposited in The Immune Epitope Database (IEDB).
32269766,Lastly, we conducted a <i>de novo</i> search of 2019-nCoV 9-mer peptides that i) bind to common HLA alleles in Chinese and European population and ii) have T Cell Receptor (TCR) recognition potential by positional weight matrices and a recently developed immunogenicity algorithm, iPred, and identified in total 63 peptides with a high immunogenicity potential. <b>Conclusions:</b> Given the limited time and resources to develop vaccine and treatments for 2019-nCoV, our work provides a shortlist of candidates for experimental validation and thus can accelerate development pipeline.
32269893,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a declared global pandemic.
32269893,There are multiple parameters of the clinical course and management of the COVID-19 that need optimization.
32269893,A hindrance to this development is the vast amount of misinformation present due to scarcely sourced manuscript preprints and social media.
32269893,This literature review aims to presents accredited and the most current studies pertaining to the basic sciences of SARS-CoV-2, clinical presentation and disease course of COVID-19, public health interventions, and current epidemiological developments.
32269893,The review on basic sciences aims to clarify the jargon in virology, describe the virion structure of SARS-CoV-2 and present pertinent details relevant to clinical practice.
32269893,Another component discussed is the brief history on the series of experiments used to explore the origins and evolution of the phylogeny of the viral genome of SARS-CoV-2.
32269893,Additionally, the clinical and epidemiological differences between COVID-19 and other infections causing outbreaks (SARS, MERS, H1N1) are elucidated.
32269893,Emphasis is placed on evidence-based medicine to evaluate the frequency of presentation of various symptoms to create a stratification system of the most important epidemiological risk factors for COVID-19.
32269893,These can be used to triage and expedite risk assessment.
32269893,Furthermore, the limitations and statistical strength of the diagnostic tools currently in clinical practice are evaluated.
32269893,Criteria on rapid screening, discharge from hospital and discontinuation of self-quarantine are clarified.
32269893,Epidemiological factors influencing the rapid rate of spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus are described.
32269893,Accurate information pertinent to improving prevention strategies is also discussed.
32269893,The penultimate portion of the review aims to explain the involvement of micronutrients such as vitamin C and vitamin D in COVID19 treatment and prophylaxis.
32269893,Furthermore, the biochemistry of the major candidates for novel therapies is briefly reviewed and a summary of their current status in the clinical trials is presented.
32269893,Lastly, the current scientific data and status of governing bodies such as the Center of Disease Control (CDC) and the WHO on the usage of controversial therapies such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (Ibuprofen), and corticosteroids usage in COVID-19 are discussed.
32269893,The composite collection of accredited studies on each of these subtopics of COVID-19 within this review will enable clarification and focus on the current status and direction in the planning of the management of this global pandemic.
32270359,Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic which in our region, Veneto (Italy), dates back to February, we were confronted with several challenges, but with a constant aim of keeping our Stroke Unit COVID-free.
32270359,For this reason, in addition to creating a dedicated hot-spot as a pre-triage just outside the Emergency Department, together with the Neuroradiology Unit we obtained a mobile CT unit that could be used by COVID-positive or COVID-suspected patients.
32270359,Furthermore, thanks to the collaboration with colleagues from different specialties (Infectious Disease, Internal Medicine, Intensive Care, Emergency Medicine), dedicated areas for COVID patients were activated.
32270359,This led to a substantial change of our acute stoke management pathway.
32270359,As the number of COVID patients increased, and the WHO declared a state of pandemic, this new stroke pathway has been fully tested.
32270359,We would like to share our experience and send a clear message to keep a high attention on stroke as an emergency condition, because we have observed a decreased number of patients with minor strokes and TIAs, longer onset-to-door and door-to-treatment times for major strokes, and a reduced number of transfers from spokes.
32270359,We strongly believe that the general population and family doctors are rightly focused on COVID.
32270359,However, to remain at home with stroke symptoms does not mean to &quot;stay safe at home&quot;.
32270371,In December 2019, some cases of viral pneumonia were epidemiologically related to a new coronavirus in the province of Hubei, China.
32270371,Subsequently, there has been an increase in infections attributable to this virus throughout China and worldwide.
32270371,The World Health Organization (WHO) has officially named the infection coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus has been classified as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32270371,This appears to be a virus from Rhinolophus bats, but the intermediate host has not yet been identified.
32270371,The mechanism of infection of SARS-CoV-2 is not yet known; it appears to have affinity for cells located in the lower airways, where it replicates.
32270371,The interhuman transmission of coronaviruses mainly occurs through saliva droplets and direct and indirect contact via surfaces.
32270371,As of March 10, 2020, the number of cases worldwide was 113,702.
32270371,Along with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS), COVID-19 appears to cause a severe clinical picture in humans, ranging from mild malaise to death by sepsis/acute respiratory distress syndrome.
32270371,The prognosis is worse in elderly patients with comorbidities.
32270371,To date, there is no specific therapy for COVID-19.
32270371,Prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection implies strategies that limit the spread of the virus.
32270371,WHO and other international and national bodies have developed continuously updated strategic objectives and provisions to contain the spread of the virus and infection.
32270515,An 80-year-old man with multiple comorbidities presented to the emergency department with tachypnea, tachycardia, fever and critically low O2 saturation and definitive chest CT scan findings in favor of COVID-19 and positive PCR results in 48 h.
32270515,He received antiviral treatment plus recombinant human Erythropoietin(rhEPO) due to his severe anemia.
32270515,After 7 days of treatment, he was discharged with miraculous improvement in his symptoms and hemoglobin level.
32270515,We concluded that rhEPO could attenuate respiratory distress syndrome and confront the SARS-CoV-2 virus through multiple mechanisms including cytokine modulation, anti-apoptotic effects, leukocyte release from bone marrow, and iron redistribution away from the intracellular virus.

32270592,We reported the clinical characteristics of a case series of 10 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) aged from 1 year to 18 years.
32270592,Seven patients had contact with confirmed COVID-19 family members before onset.
32270592,Fever (4 [40.0%]) and cough (3 [30.0%]) were the most common symptoms.
32270592,No patient showed leucopenia and lymphopenia on admission.
32270592,Pneumonia was observed in chest CT images in 5 (50.0%) patients.
32270592,Five (50.0%) patients received antiviral treatment.
32270592,No patient had severe complications or developed a severe illness in our study.
32270592,Our study indicated that COVID-19 children present less severe symptoms and have better outcomes.
32271376,An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is becoming a public health emergency.
32271376,Data are limited on the duration and host factors related to viral shedding.
32271376,In this retrospective study, risk factors associated with severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA shedding were evaluated in a cohort of 113 symptomatic patients from two hospitals outside Wuhan.
32271376,The median duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection was 17 days (Interquartile Range [IQR], 13-22 days) as measured from illness onset.
32271376,When comparing patients with early (&lt;15 days) and late viral RNA clearance (≥15 days after illness onset), prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding was associated with male sex (p=0.009), old age (p=0.033), concomitated with hypertension (p=0.009), delayed admission to hospital after illness onset (p=0.001), severe illness at admission (p=0.049), invasive mechanical ventilation (p=0.006), and corticosteroid treatment (p=0.025).
32271376,Patients with longer SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding duration had slower recovery of body temperature (p&lt;0.001) and focal absorption on radiograph images (p&lt;0.001) than patients with early SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance.
32271376,Male sex (odds ratio [OR], 3.24 [95% CI, 1.31-8.02]), delayed hospital admission (OR, 1.30 [95% CI, 1.10-1.54]), and invasive mechanical ventilation (OR, 9.88 [95% CI, 1.11-88.02]) were independent risk factors for prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding.
32271376,Male sex, delayed admission to hospital after illness onset, and invasive mechanical ventilation were associated with prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding.
32271376,Hospital admission and general treatments should be started as soon as possible in symptomatic COVID-19 patients, especially male patients.
32271454,Beginning in December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), due to 2019-nCoV infection, emerged in Wuhan and spread rapidly throughout China and even worldwide.
32271454,Employing combined therapy of modern medicine and traditional Chinese medicine has been proposed, in which Ma Xing Shi Gan Decoction (MXSGD) was recommended as a basic prescription and applied widely in the clinical treatment of COVID-19.
32271454,We investigated the underlying mechanism of MXSGD in treating COVID-19 utilizing the approaches of integrating network pharmacology.
32271454,A total of 97 active ingredients of MXSGD were screened out, and 169 targets were predicted.
32271454,The protein-protein interaction network exhibited hub targets of MXSGD, such as Heat shock protein 90, RAC-alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase, Transcription factor AP-1, Mitogen-activated protein kinase 1, Cellular tumor antigen p53, Vascular endothelial growth factor A, and Tumour necrosis factor.
32271454,Gene Ontology functional enrichment analysis demonstrated that the biological processes altered within the body after taking MXSGD were closely related to the regulation of such processes as the acute inflammatory response, chemokine production, vascular permeability, response to oxygen radicals, oxidative stress-induced apoptosis, T cell differentiation involved in the immune response, immunoglobulin secretion, and extracellular matrix disassembly.
32271454,KEGG enrichment analysis indicated that the targets of MXSGD were significantly enriched in inflammation-related pathways, immunomodulation-related pathways, and viral infection-related pathways.
32271454,The therapeutic mechanisms of MXSGD on COVID-19 may primarily involve the following effects: reducing inflammation, suppressing cytokine storm, protecting the pulmonary alveolar-capillary barrier, alleviating pulmonary edema, regulating the immune response, and decreasing fever.
32271455,Since the end of 2019, COVID-19 has been prevalent in Wuhan, China, and has been rapidly spreading to mainland China.
32271455,Currently, more than 80,000 people have been infected, of which over 10,000 were severely ill and had characteristics of dyspnea and hypoxemia about one week after onset.
32271455,Severe patients had rapidly progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), causing multiple organ failures and even death, with a mortality rate of nearly 4.3%.
32271455,The treatment of severe COVID-19 patients has been rarely reported.
32271455,This study reported a successful example of a severe COVID-19 patient with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) technology in our hospital.
32271455,This experience revealed that the early application of ECMO can dramatically promote the recovery of severe COVID-19 patients.
32271456,The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which outbroke in December 2019 is highly contagious with a low cure rate.
32271456,In view of this, there is an urgent need to find a more appropriate therapeutic scheme against COVID-19.
32271456,The study aimed to investigate whether lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) in combination with other pneumonia-associated adjuvant drugs has a better therapeutic effect on COVID-19.
32271456,Totally 47 patients with COVID-19 infection who were admitted to Rui'an People's Hospital between January 22 and January 29, 2020 were collected.
32271456,The patients were divided into the test group and the control group according to whether they had been treated with LPV/r or not during hospitalization.
32271456,Patients in the test group were treated with LPV/r combined with adjuvant medicine, while those in the control group were just treated with adjuvant medicine.
32271456,The changes of body temperature, blood routine and blood biochemistry between the two groups were observed and compared.
32271456,Both groups achieved good therapeutic effect with the body temperature of patients decreased gradually from admission to the 10th day of treatment.
32271456,But the body temperature of patients in the test group decreased faster than that of the control group.
32271456,Blood routine indexes showed that compared with the control group, the abnormal proportion of white blood cells, lymphocytes and C-reactive protein of the test group could be reduced to some extent.
32271456,Blood biochemical indexes exhibited that the proportion of patients with abnormal alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase in the test group were lower than the control group.
32271456,The number of days for nCoV-RNA turning negative after treatment was significantly decreased in the test group than that in the control group.
32271456,Compared with the treatment of pneumonia-associated adjuvant drugs alone, the combination treatment with LPV/r and adjuvant drugs has a more evident therapeutic effect in lowering the body temperature and restoring normal physiological mechanisms with no evident toxic and side effects.
32271456,In view of these conclusions, we suggested that the use of LPV/r combined with pneumonia-associated adjuvant drugs in the clinical treatment for patients with COVID-19 should be promoted.
32271458,Coronavirus COVID-19 further transmitted to several countries globally.
32271458,The status of the infected cases can be determined basing on the treatment process along with several other factors.
32271458,This research aims to build a classifier prediction model to predict the status of recovered and death coronavirus CovID-19 patients in South Korea.
32271458,Artificial neural network principle is used to classify the collected data between February 20, 2020 and March 9, 2020.
32271458,The proposed classifier used different seven variables, namely, country, infection reason, sex, group, confirmation date, birth year, and region.
32271458,The most effective variables on recovered and fatal cases are analyzed based on the neural network model.
32271458,The results found that the proposed predictive classifier efficiently predicted recovered and death cases.
32271458,Besides, it is found that discovering the infection reason would increase the probability to recover the patient.
32271458,This indicates that the virus might be controllable based on infection reasons.
32271458,In addition, the earlier discovery of the disease affords better control and a higher probability of being recovered.
32271458,Our recommendation is to use this model to predict the status of the patients globally.
32271459,In December 2019, a new type of coronavirus-infected pneumonia broke out in Wuhan and spread rapidly to other parts of the country.
32271459,The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical features of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32271459,A retrospective analysis was performed on the confirmed cases of COVID-19, who were admitted to the North Hospital of Changsha first Hospital (Changsha Public Health treatment Center) from January 17 to February 7, 2020.
32271459,The median age of COVID-19 patients was 45 years (range 33.5-57).
32271459,The male patients accounted for 49.7%, 64.6% of the patients had a history of exposure in Wuhan, and 31.7% had family aggregation.
32271459,The median days of onset were six, and the incidence of severe illness was 18.6%.
32271459,Compared with the non-severe group, the severe group showed statistical significance in older age, hypertension, bilateral lung plaque shadow, decrease in lymphocyte count, increase in C-reactive protein (CRP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase.
32271459,Age, combined hypertension, oxygenation index, double lung patch, decreased lymphocyte count, and elevated levels of C-reactive protein, aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase can be used as predictors of the disease severity.
32271490,Early reports have suggested that smell loss may be an early symptom associated with the pandemic known as COVID-19.
32271490,The possibility that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) might cause olfactory dysfunction is certainly plausible.
32271490,Patients presenting to specialized smell clinics are commonly diagnosed with upper respiratory infection (URI)-associated olfactory loss and most are presumed to be viral related.
32271490,In acute phases of infection, it is common to experience some smell loss as a result of nasal inflammation, mucosal edema, and obstruction of airflow into the olfactory cleft.
32271490,In most cases, these episodes of smell loss are self-limiting and coincide with resolution of URI symptoms.
32271490,However, in some cases the smell loss persists for months to years and this is presumed to occur through a more direct olfactory insult by the virus.
32271490,It remains too early to know whether infection with SARS-CoV-2 causes persistent olfactory dysfunction.
32271490,However, given the scale of this pandemic, if SARS-CoV-2 does cause chronic olfactory loss in even a small portion of those infected, then the overall population prevalence could be quite large.
32271490,This review provides a brief, practical overview of viral-associated olfactory loss, realizing that evidence related to COVID-19 will likely not be clear for some time.
32271490,Our goal is to highlight the existence and importance of this condition and provide information geared for both providers and patients.
32271490,Practical suggestions regarding evaluation and treatment will be provided, realizing that there may be constraints on medical resources and the nature of this pandemic remains dynamic.

32271599,On March 11th 2020, the coronavirus outbreak was declared a pandemic by the WHO.
32271599,One of the groups that is considered high risk in this pandemic are cancer patients as they are treated with a variety of immune system suppressor treatment modalities and this puts them in a great risk for infectious disease (including COVID-19).
32271599,Therefore, cancer patients require higher level measures for preventing and treating infectious diseases. furthermore, cancer patients may bear additional risk due to the restriction of access to the routine diagnostic and therapeutic services during such epidemic.
32271599,Since most of the attention of health systems is towards patients affected with COVID-19, the need for structured and unified approaches to COVID-19 prevention and care specific to cancer patients and cancer centers is felt more than ever.
32271599,This article provides the recommendations and possible actions that should be considered by patients, their caregivers and families, physician, nurses, managers and staff of medical centers involved in cancer diagnosis and treatment.
32271599,We pursued two major goals in our recommendations: first, limiting the exposure of cancer patients to medical environments and second, modifying the treatment modalities in a manner that reduces the probability of myelosuppression such as delaying elective diagnostic and therapeutic services, shortening the treatment course, or prolonging the interval between treatment courses.
32271601,Since December 2019, there has been an outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection in Wuhan, China.
32271601,Meanwhile, the outbreak also drew attention and concern from the World Health Organization (WHO).
32271601,COVID-19 is another human infectious disease caused by coronavirus.
32271601,The transmission of COVID-19 is potent and the infection rate is fast.
32271601,Since there is no specific drug for COVID-19, the treatment is mainly symptomatic supportive therapy.
32271601,In addition, it should be pointed out that patients with severe illness need more aggressive treatment and meticulous care.
32271601,Recently, accurate RNA detection has been decisive for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
32271601,The development of highly sensitive RT-PCR has facilitated epidemiological studies that provide insight into the prevalence, seasonality, clinical manifestations and course of COVID-19 infection.
32271601,In this review, we summarize the epidemiology and characteristics of COVID-19.
32272173,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has focused attention on the need to develop effective therapies against the causative agent, SARS-CoV-2, and also against other pathogenic coronaviruses (CoV) that have emerged in the past or might appear in future.
32272173,Researchers are therefore focusing on steps in the CoV replication cycle that may be vulnerable to inhibition by broad-spectrum or specific antiviral agents.
32272173,The conserved nature of the fusion domain and mechanism across the CoV family make it a valuable target to elucidate and develop pan-CoV therapeutics.
32272173,In this article, we review the role of the CoV spike protein in mediating fusion of the viral and host cell membranes, summarizing the results of research on SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and recent peer-reviewed studies of SARS-CoV-2, and suggest that the fusion mechanism be investigated as a potential antiviral target.
32272173,We also provide a supplemental file containing background information on the biology, epidemiology, and clinical features of all human-infecting coronaviruses, along with a phylogenetic tree of these coronaviruses.
32272396,The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is an emerging pathogen that was first described in late December 2019 and causes a severe respiratory infection in humans.
32272396,Since the outbreak of COVID-19, international attention has raised to develop treatment and control options such as types of immunotherapies.
32272396,The immunotherapy is an effective method for fighting against similar viral infections such as SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV.
32272396,These methods include several types of vaccines, monoclonal antibody candidates, and etc.
32272396,This systematic review article was designed to evaluate the existing evidence and experience related to immunotherapy for 2019-nCoV.
32272396,Web of Science (ISI), PubMed, and Scopus databases were used to search for suitable keywords such as 2019-nCoV, novel coronavirus, Immunotherapy, interleukin, vaccine and the related words for relevant publications up to 24.3.2020.
32272396,The present systematic review was performed based on PRISMA protocol.
32272396,Data extraction and quality valuation of articles were performed by two reviewers. 51 articles were the results of the search and based on the inclusions and exclusions criteria, 7 articles were included in the final review.
32272396,As a conclusion of these studies demonstratedthat although no serious research has been done on this subject at the time of writing this article, similar studies on the related viruses showed notable results.
32272396,So immunotherapy for this virus can also be a suitable option.
32272481,A new coronavirus (CoV) identified as COVID-19 virus is the etiological agent responsible for the 2019-2020 viral pneumonia outbreak that commenced in Wuhan<sup>1-4</sup>.
32272481,Currently there are no targeted therapeutics and effective treatment options remain very limited.
32272481,In order to rapidly discover lead compounds for clinical use, we initiated a program of combined structure-assisted drug design, virtual drug screening and high-throughput screening to identify new drug leads that target the COVID-19 virus main protease (M<sup>pro</sup>).
32272481,M<sup>pro</sup> is a key CoV enzyme, which plays a pivotal role in mediating viral replication and transcription, making it an attractive drug target for this virus<sup>5,6</sup>.
32272481,Here, we identified a mechanism-based inhibitor, N3, by computer-aided drug design and subsequently determined the crystal structure of COVID-19 virus M<sup>pro</sup> in complex with this compound.
32272481,Next, through a combination of structure-based virtual and high-throughput screening, we assayed over 10,000 compounds including approved drugs, drug candidates in clinical trials, and other pharmacologically active compounds as inhibitors of M<sup>pro</sup>.
32272481,Six of these compounds inhibited M<sup>pro</sup> with IC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 0.67 to 21.4 μM.
32272481,Ebselen also exhibited promising antiviral activity in cell-based assays.
32272481,Our results demonstrate the efficacy of this screening strategy, which can lead to the rapid discovery of drug leads with clinical potential in response to new infectious diseases for which no specific drugs or vaccines are available.
32272630,The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 infection is spreading worldwide, and there are many reports of acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by this infection.
32272630,However, asymptomatic lung involvement has not been reported.
32272630,We hereby present the case of a 44-year-old health-care worker, who was found to be infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus after a CT-scan performed for an unrelated condition revealed a lesion in the lung field compatible with COVID-19 infection.
32272630,His condition deteriorated initially, but eventually improved with supportive treatment and the compassionate use of antivirals and antimalarials and is now in a stable condition.
32272857,In light of the current novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, as well as other viral outbreaks in the 21st century, there is a dire need for new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to combat infectious diseases worldwide.
32272857,As a convergence science, tissue engineering has traditionally focused on the application of engineering principles to biological systems, collaboration across disciplines, and rapid translation of technologies from the benchtop to the bedside.
32272857,Given these strengths, tissue engineers are particularly well suited to apply their skill set to the current crisis and viral outbreaks in general.
32272857,This work introduces the basics of virology and epidemiology for tissue engineers, and highlights important developments in the field of tissue engineering relevant to the current pandemic, including <i>in vitro</i> model systems, vaccine technology, and small-molecule drug delivery.
32272857,COVID-19 serves as a call to arms for scientists across all disciplines, and tissue engineers are well trained to be leaders and contributors in this time of need.
32272857,Impact statement Given the steep mortality caused by the recent novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, there is clear need for advances in diagnostics and therapeutics for viral outbreaks.
32272857,Tissue engineering has the potential for critical impact on clinical outcomes in viral outbreaks.
32272857,Tissue engineers, if mobilized, could play key roles as leaders in the outbreak, given their ability to apply engineering principles to biological processes, experience in collaborative environments, and penchant for technological translation from benchtop to bedside.
32272857,In this work, three areas pioneered by tissue engineers that could be applied to the current COVID-19 crisis and future viral outbreaks are highlighted.
32273253,To discuss hospital pharmacists' role in providing pharmaceutical care for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 to promote patient care and management during the pandemic.
32273253,Based on the method of evidence-based pharmacy, clinical evidence of therapeutical drugs for COVID-19 were retrieved and summarized.
32273253,Based on clinical experience Chinese hospital pharmacists gained from providing pharmaceutical care services during COVID-19 pandemic, taking COVID-19 hospitalized patients' needs into consideration, the methods and strategies hospital pharmacists shall use to provide pharmaceutical care were analyzed and summarized.
32273253,Hospital pharmacists shall support pharmaceutical care services by participating in making evidence-based decisions for medication, monitoring and evaluation of medication safety and efficacy, providing strengthened care for special population and patients with combined underlying diseases, monitoring and management of convalescent plasma therapy, providing emotional counselling and psychological support, and providing scientific information about COVID-19 vaccines.
32273253,The need of pharmaceutical care services in COVID-19 hospitalized patients during this pandemic was quite distinguished from the past.
32273253,Hospital pharmacists shall join the collaborative multidisciplinary team to improve COVID-19 patients' outcome and reduce mortality, and to facilitate the pandemic control.
32273489,Computed tomography (CT) manifestations and treatment of children with COVID-19 are still unclear.
32273489,We report serial CT findings of a child with COVID-19 pneumonia who recovered without any sequelae.
32273490,Pediatric coronavirus disease - 19 (COVID-19) infection is relatively mild when compared to adults, and children are reported to have a better prognosis.
32273490,Mortality in children appears rare.
32273490,Clinical features of COVID-19 in children include fever and cough, but a large proportion of infected children appears to be asymptomatic and may contribute to transmission.
32273490,It remains unclear why children and young adults are less severely affected than older individuals, but this might involve differences in immune system function in the elderly and/or differences in the expression/function of the cellular receptor for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) - Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
32273490,Laboratory findings and chest imaging may not be specific in children with COVID-19.
32273490,Diagnosis is by Reverse transcriptase-Polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing of upper or lower respiratory tract secretions.
32273490,This review additionally considers COVID-19 in immunosuppressed children, and also suggests a management algorithm for the few children who appear to present with life threatening infection, including the potential use of antiviral and immunomodulatory treatment.
32273490,The most significant threat to global child health from SARS-CoV-2 is unlikely to be related to COVID 19 in children, but rather the socio-economic consequences of a prolonged pandemic.
32274341,An outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (2019 coronavirus disease, COVID-19) since December 2019, from Wuhan, China, has been posing a significant threat to global human health.
32274341,The clinical features and outcomes of Chinese patients with COVID-19 have been widely reported.
32274341,Increasing evidence has witnessed the frequent incident liver injury in COVID-19 patients, and it is often manifested as transient elevation of serum aminotransferases; however, the patients seldom have liver failure and obvious intrahepatic cholestasis, unless pre-existing advanced liver disease was present.
32274341,The underlying mechanisms of liver injury in cases of COVID-19 might include psychological stress, systemic inflammation response, drug toxicity, and progression of pre-existing liver diseases.
32274341,However, there is insufficient evidence for SARS-CoV-2 infected hepatocytes or virus-related liver injury in COVID-19 at present.
32274341,The clinical, pathological and laboratory characteristics as well as underlying pathophysiology and etiology of liver injury in COVID-19 remain largely unclear.
32274341,In this review, we highlight these important issues based on the recent developments in the field, for optimizing the management and treatment of liver injury in Chinese patients with COVID-19.
32274342,The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has attracted increasing worldwide attention.
32274342,Cases of liver damage or dysfunction (mainly characterized by moderately elevated serum aspartate aminotransferase levels) have been reported among patients with COVID-19.
32274342,However, it is currently uncertain whether the COVID-19-related liver damage/dysfunction is due mainly to the viral infection per se or other coexisting conditions, such as the use of potentially hepatotoxic drugs and the coexistence of systemic inflammatory response, respiratory distress syndrome-induced hypoxia, and multiple organ dysfunction.
32274342,Based on the current evidence from case reports and case series, this review article focuses on the demographic and clinical characteristics, potential mechanisms, and treatment options for COVID-19-related liver dysfunction.
32274342,This review also describes the geographical and demographic distribution of COVID-19-related liver dysfunction, as well as possible underlying mechanisms linking COVID-19 to liver dysfunction, in order to facilitate future drug development, prevention, and control measures for COVID-19.
32274425,As the global COVID-19 pandemic escalates there is a need within radiation oncology to work to support our patients in the best way possible.
32274425,Measures are required to reduce infection spread between patients and within the workforce.
32274425,Departments need contingency planning to create capacity and continue essential treatments despite a reduced workforce.
32274425,The #radonc community held an urgent online journal club on Twitter in March 2020 to discuss these issues and create some consensus on crucial next steps.
32274425,There were 121 global contributors.
32274425,This document summarises these discussions around themes of infection prevention, rationalisation of workload and working practice in the presence of infection.
32274630,The Coronavirus pandemic has created unprecedented strain on medical resources at health care institutions around the world.
32274630,At many institutions, this has resulted in efforts to prioritize cases with an attempt to balance the acuity of medical needs with available resources.
32274630,Here, we provide a framework for institutions and governments to help adjudicate treatment allocations to patients with neuro-oncologic disease.
32274772,The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is causing a necessary, rapid adjustment within the field of obstetrics.
32274772,Corticosteroid use is a mainstay of therapy for those women delivering prematurely.
32274772,Unfortunately, corticosteroid use has been associated with worse outcomes in COVID-19 positive patients.
32274772,Given this information, it is necessary that obstetricians adjust practice to carefully weigh the fetal benefits with maternal risks.
32274772,Therefore, our institution has examined the risks and benefits and altered our corticosteroid recommendations.
32274772,· Corticosteroid use is an important part of prematurity treatment because it provides benefit to the fetus..
32274772,· Corticosteroid use may be related with increased morbidity and mortality in novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)..
32274772,· Therefore, during the COVID-19 pandemic, an alteration in current corticosteroid practices is necessary to uniquely weigh the maternal risks and fetal benefits..
32274773,COVID-19, a new viral disease affecting primarily the respiratory system and the lung, has caused a pandemic with serious challenges to health systems around the world.
32274773,In about 20% of patients, severe symptoms occur after a mean incubation period of 5 - 6 days; 5% of patients need intensive care therapy.
32274773,Morbidity is about 1 - 2%.
32274773,Protecting health care workers is of paramount importance in order to prevent hospital acquired infections.
32274773,Therefore, during all procedures associated with aerosol production, a personal safety equipment consisting of a FFP2/FFP3 (N95) respiratory mask, gloves, safety glasses and a waterproof overall should be used.
32274773,Therapy is based on established recommendations issued for patients with acute lung injury (ARDS).
32274773,Lung protective ventilation, prone position, restrictive fluid management and an adequate management of organ failures are the mainstays of therapy.
32274773,In case of fulminant lung failure, veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may be used as a rescue in experienced centres.
32274773,New, experimental therapies evolve with ever increasing frequency; currently, however, there is no evidence based recommendation possible.
32274773,If off-label and compassionate use of these drugs is considered, an individual benefit-risk assessment is necessary, since serious side effects have been reported.
32274773,Der Übersichtsartikel ist als praktische Handreichung für alle gedacht, die COVID-19-Patienten behandeln bzw. in nächster Zeit behandeln werden, und fasst das derzeit verfügbare Wissen zu Diagnostik und Therapie zusammen.
32274773,Zusätzlich werden auch neue und experimentelle Therapien bewertet, soweit dazu zumindest Einzelfallberichte vorliegen.
32274774,The most common human corona viruses cause common colds.
32274774,But three of these viruses cause more serious, acute diseases; Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS by MERS-CoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) by SARS-CoV and COVID-19 by SARS-CoV-2.
32274774,The current outbreak was classified by the WHO as a &quot;global public health emergency&quot;.
32274774,Despite all efforts to reduce the surgical lists and to cancel or postpone non-time-critical surgical interventions, some surgical and anesthetic interventions outside of intensive care medicine are still necessary and must be performed.
32274774,This is particularly true for obstetric interventions and neuraxial labor analgesia.
32274774,Workload in the delivery room is presumably not going to decrease and planned cesarean sections cannot be postponed.
32274774,In the meantime, the clinical course and outcome of some COVID-19 patients with an existing pregnancy or peripartum courses have been reported.
32274774,There are already numerous recommendations from national and international bodies regarding the care of such patients.
32274774,Some of these recommendations will be summarized in this manuscript.
32274774,The selection of aspects should by no means be seen as a form of prioritization.
32274774,The general treatment principles in dealing with COVID-19 patients and the recommendations for action in intensive care therapy also apply to pregnant and postpartum patients.
32274774,In this respect, there are naturally considerable redundancies and only a few aspects apply strictly or exclusively to the cohort of obstetric patients.
32274774,In summary, at present it must be stated that the general care recommendations that also apply to non-COVID-19 patients are initially valid with regard to obstetric anesthesia.
32274774,Nevertheless, the special requirements on the part of hygiene and infection protection result in special circumstances that should be taken into account when caring for pregnant patients from an anesthetic point of view.
32274774,These relate to both medical aspects, but also to a particular extent logistics issues with regard to spatial separation, staffing and material resources.
32274774,Die häufigsten menschlichen Coronaviren verursachen unkomplizierte Erkältungen.
32274774,Drei dieser Viren jedoch lösen schwerere, akute Krankheiten aus: das Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) durch MERS-CoV, das schwere akute respiratorische Syndrom (SARS) durch SARS-CoV und COVID-19 durch SARS-CoV-2.
32274774,Seitens der WHO wurde der aktuell währende Ausbruch als „global public health emergency“ eingestuft.
32274774,Trotz aller Bestrebungen, das OP-Programm zu reduzieren und nicht zeitkritische operative Eingriffe zunächst abzusagen bzw. zu verschieben, sind weiter operative Eingriffe und anästhesiologische Interventionen jenseits der Intensivversorgung notwendig.
32274774,Dies trifft im besonderen Maße für geburtshilfliche Eingriffe und die neuraxiale Analgesie im Rahmen des Spontanpartus zu.
32274774,So wird der Kreißsaal mutmaßlich unverändert frequentiert werden und auch „elektive Sectiones“ werden weiterhin stattfinden müssen.
32274774,Mittlerweile sind klinischer Verlauf und Outcome einiger COVID-19-Patientinnen mit bestehender Schwangerschaft bzw. peripartale Verläufe berichtet worden.
32274774,Es liegen bereits zahlreiche Empfehlungen nationaler und internationaler Gremien in Bezug auf die Versorgung solcher Patientinnen vor.
32274774,Einige dieser Empfehlungen sollen im Rahmen dieses Beitrages kursorisch dargelegt werden.
32274774,Die Auswahl der Aspekte soll keineswegs als eine Form der Priorisierung angesehen werden.
32274774,Die allgemeinen Behandlungsgrundsätze im Umgang mit COVID-19-Patientinnen und die Handlungsempfehlungen zur intensivmedizinischen Therapie behalten dabei auch für schwangere und postpartale Patientinnen Gültigkeit.
32274774,Insofern ergeben sich naturgemäß erhebliche Redundanzen, und nur wenige Aspekte treffen streng bzw. ausschließlich auf das Kollektiv geburtshilflicher Patientinnen zu.
32274774,Zusammenfassend muss zum gegenwärtigen Zeitpunkt konstatiert werden, dass in der geburtshilflichen Anästhesie zunächst die allgemeinen Versorgungsempfehlungen gelten, die auch für Non-COVID-19-Patientinnen geltengültig sind.
32274774,Gleichwohl ergeben sich durch die besonderen Vorgaben seitens der Hygiene bzw. des Infektionsschutzes besondere Umstände, die bei der Versorgung schwangerer Patientinnen berücksichtigt werden sollten.
32274774,Diese betreffen neben medizinischen Fragen im Besonderen auch Fragen der Logistik in Hinblick auf eine räumliche Separierung, die Personalvorhaltung und materielle Ressourcen.
32275128,To analyze the roles of multidisciplinary team (MDT) in the diagnosis and treatment of suspected cases of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32275128,The clinical data of 48 patients with suspected COVID-19 admitted in Jinhua Central Hospital from January 21, 2020 to March 20, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed.
32275128,Of the 48 suspected cases, 18 were diagnosed with COVID-19, and 30 were excluded.
32275128,Each of the confirmed cases were discussed among MDT for 2 to 12 times with an average of (4.7±3.2) times; while for non-COVID-19 patients were discussed for 2 to 4 times with an average of (2.3±0.6) times per case.
32275128,With the guidance of MDT, one COVID-19 patient was transferred to designated provincial hospital after effective treatment; one patient complicated with acute cholecystitis underwent gallbladder puncture and drainage; and COVID-19 was excluded in a highly suspected patient after alveolar lavage fluid examination.
32275128,Except one transferred patient, all 17 confirmed COVID-19 patients were cured and discharged; there was no cross-infection occurred in suspected patients during the hospitalization; there were no deaths and no medical staff infections.
32275128,The efficiency of diagnosis and treatment for suspected COVID-19 patients can be improved under MDT mode, particularly for complicated and refractory cases.
32275256,The spread of COVID-19 epidemic in Italy, and particularly in Lombardy determined the need to standardize the therapeutic approach in order to offer the same indications for all hospitals in Lombardy.
32275256,However, no specific drug has been previously approved for the COVID-19 treatment.
32275256,The Lombardy Section of the Italian Society of Infectious and Tropical Diseases provided this «vademecum» with the aim to explore the current evidence about the drugs likely to be efficacious in the treatment of COVID-19.
32275256,Moreover, a multidisciplinary group including critical care specialists has been created in order to provide indications about supporting measures and the use of steroids.
32275256,A new grading scale has been proposed to help patients' stratification according to the severity of the respiratory conditions.
32275256,Lastly, a collaborating group with immunologists and rheumatologists has been built with the aim of providing some guidance about the use of tocilizumab, a promising option for the treatment of the hyperinflammatory state occurring in most patients affected by COVID-19.
32275257,The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19), spreading from Wuhan, China, is one of the causes of respiratory infections that can spread to other people through respiratory particles, and can cause symptoms such as fever, dry cough, shortness of breath, anorexia, fatigue and sore throat in infected patients.
32275257,This review summarizes current strategies on the diagnosis.
32275257,Additionally, treatments, infection prevention and control of the SARS-CoV-2 are addressed.
32275257,In addition to the respiratory system, this virus can infect the digestive system, the urinary system and the haematological system, which causes to observe the virus in the stool, urine and blood samples in addition to throat sample.
32275257,The SARS-CoV-2 causes changes in blood cells and factors and makes lung abnormalities in patients, which can be detected by serological, molecular, and radiological techniques by detecting these changes and injuries.
32275257,Radiological and serological methods are the most preferred among the other methods and the radiological method is the most preferred one which can diagnose the infection quickly and accurately with fewer false-negatives, that can be effective in protecting the patient's life by initiating treatment and preventing the transmission of infection to other people.
32275295,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a pandemic, and it is unknown whether a combination of public health interventions can improve control of the outbreak.
32275295,To evaluate the association of public health interventions with the epidemiological features of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan by 5 periods according to key events and interventions.
32275295,In this cohort study, individual-level data on 32 583 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases reported between December 8, 2019, and March 8, 2020, were extracted from the municipal Notifiable Disease Report System, including patients' age, sex, residential location, occupation, and severity classification.
32275295,Nonpharmaceutical public health interventions including cordons sanitaire, traffic restriction, social distancing, home confinement, centralized quarantine, and universal symptom survey.
32275295,Rates of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infections (defined as the number of cases per day per million people), across age, sex, and geographic locations were calculated across 5 periods: December 8 to January 9 (no intervention), January 10 to 22 (massive human movement due to the Chinese New Year holiday), January 23 to February 1 (cordons sanitaire, traffic restriction and home quarantine), February 2 to 16 (centralized quarantine and treatment), and February 17 to March 8 (universal symptom survey).
32275295,The effective reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 (an indicator of secondary transmission) was also calculated over the periods.
32275295,Among 32 583 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, the median patient age was 56.7 years (range, 0-103; interquartile range, 43.4-66.8) and 16 817 (51.6%) were women.
32275295,The daily confirmed case rate peaked in the third period and declined afterward across geographic regions and sex and age groups, except for children and adolescents, whose rate of confirmed cases continued to increase.
32275295,The daily confirmed case rate over the whole period in local health care workers (130.5 per million people [95% CI, 123.9-137.2]) was higher than that in the general population (41.5 per million people [95% CI, 41.0-41.9]).
32275295,The proportion of severe and critical cases decreased from 53.1% to 10.3% over the 5 periods.
32275295,The severity risk increased with age: compared with those aged 20 to 39 years (proportion of severe and critical cases, 12.1%), elderly people (≥80 years) had a higher risk of having severe or critical disease (proportion, 41.3%; risk ratio, 3.61 [95% CI, 3.31-3.95]) while younger people (&lt;20 years) had a lower risk (proportion, 4.1%; risk ratio, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.31-0.70]).
32275295,The effective reproduction number fluctuated above 3.0 before January 26, decreased to below 1.0 after February 6, and decreased further to less than 0.3 after March 1.
32275295,A series of multifaceted public health interventions was temporally associated with improved control of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China.
32275295,These findings may inform public health policy in other countries and regions.
32275452,COVID-19 pandemic is now a global health concern.
32275452,We compared the clinical characteristics, laboratory examinations, CT images and treatment of COVID-19 patients from three different cities in China. 476 patients were recruited from Jan 1 to Feb 15, 2020 at three hospitals in Wuhan, Shanghai and Anhui.
32275452,Patients were divided into four groups according to age and into three groups (moderate, severe, and critical group) according to the fifth version of the guidelines issued by the National Health Commission of China on Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19.
32275452,Compared with moderate group (37.8%), the incidence of comorbidities was higher in severe (46.3%) and critical groups (67.1%).
32275452,Compared with severe and critical groups, there were more patients taking ACEI/ARB in moderate group.
32275452,More patients had multiple lung lobe involvement and pleural effusion in the critical group as compared to moderate group.
32275452,Compared with the moderate group, more patients received antiviral agents within first 4 days than in severe group, and more patients received antibiotics and corticosteriods in critical and severe groups.
32275452,Patients over 75 years old had significantly lower survival rate than the younger patients.
32275452,Multiple organ dysfunction and impaired immune function were the typical characteristics of severe and critical patients.
32275452,There was a significant difference in angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers usage among patients with different severities.
32275452,Involvement of multiple lung lobes and pleural effusion were associated with the severity of COVID-19.
32275452,Advanced age (≥75 years) was a risk factor for mortality.

32275463,<b> <i>Background:</i> </b> The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.
32275463,This study aims to evaluate the knowledge of anesthesiology specialists and residents in Turkey about COVID-19 and their attitudes toward the strategies and application methods to be used for a suspected/confirmed COVID-19 case that needs to be operated on or followed up in an intensive care unit, as well as to raise awareness about this issue. <b> <i>Methods:</i> </b> This descriptive study comprised anesthesiology specialists and residents working in various health institutions in Turkey.
32275463,The data used in this study were obtained online between March 13, 2020 and March 25, 2020 through the website SurveyMonkey (SurveyMonkey, San Mateo, CA) by using a survey form.
32275463,We contacted members of the Turkish Anaesthesiology and Reanimation Society through the social media platforms Twitter, LinkedIn, and WhatsApp, as well as through their e-mail addresses and invited them to participate in the study.
32275463,Those who agreed to participate responded to the aforementioned survey.
32275463,We used SPSS 22.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY) to analyze the survey data statistically. <b> <i>Results:</i> </b> A total of 346 anesthesiology specialists and residents participated in the study.
32275463,Although the majority of the participants exhibited the correct attitudes toward airway management, research assistants with little professional experience were observed to be undecided or had the tendency to make incorrect decisions. <b> <i>Conclusions:</i> </b> The COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly worldwide.
32275463,The incidence of COVID-19 cases is increasing daily, and this disease can cause patient death.
32275463,Anesthesiology specialists and residents who perform emergency operations on these patients in settings other than intensive care units should follow simple and easy-to-understand algorithms to ensure safety.
32275463,The provision of theoretical and practical training to healthcare providers before they meet patients will help ensure patient-healthcare provider safety and prevent panic, which can cause distress among healthcare providers.
32275497,To determine distribution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in hospital wards in Wuhan, China, we tested air and surface samples.
32275497,Contamination was greater in intensive care units than general wards.
32275497,Virus was widely distributed on floors, computer mice, trash cans, and sickbed handrails and was detected in air ≈4 m from patients.
32275740,The ILROG guidelines for using radiation therapy in hematological malignancies are widely used in many countries.
32275740,The emergency situation created by the COVID-19 pandemic may result in limitations of treatment resources.
32275740,Furthermore, in recognition of the need to also reduce the exposure of patients and staff to potential infection with COVID-19, the ILROG task force has made recommendations for alternative radiation treatment schemes.
32275740,The emphasis is on maintaining clinical efficacy and safety by increasing the dose per fraction while reducing the number of daily treatments.
32275740,The guidance is informed by adhering to acceptable radiobiological parameters and clinical tolerability.
32275740,The options for delaying or omitting RT in some hematological categories are also discussed.
32275753,Lungs from patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have shown typical signs of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), formation of hyaline membrane mainly composed of fibrin, and 'ground-glass' opacity.
32275753,Previously, we showed plasminogen itself is a key regulator in fibrin degradation, wound healing and infection.
32275753,We aimed to investigate whether plasminogen can improve lung lesions and hypoxemia of COVID-19.
32275753,Thirteen clinically moderate, severe or critical COVID-19 patients were treated with atomization inhalation of freeze-dried plasminogen.
32275753,Levels of their lung lesions, oxygen saturation and heart rates were compared before and after treatment by CT scanning images and patient monitor.
32275753,After plasminogen inhalation, conditions of lung lesions in 5 clinically moderate patients have quickly improved, shown as the decreased range and density of 'ground glass' opacity.
32275753,Improvements of oxygen saturation were observed in 6 clinically severe patients.
32275753,In the 2 patients with critical conditions, the oxygen levels have significantly increased from 79-82% to 91% just about 1 hour after the first inhalation.
32275753,In 8 of 13 patients the heart rates had slowed down.
32275753,For the 5 clinically moderate patients, the difference is even statistically significant.
32275753,Furthermore, a general relief of chest tightness was observed.
32275753,Whereas it is reported that plasminogen is dramatically increased in adults with ARDS, this study suggests that additional plasminogen may be effective and efficient in treating lung lesions and hypoxemia during COVID-19 infections.
32275753,Although further studies are needed, this study highlights a possible hope of efficiently combating this rapid epidemic emergency.
32275775,COVID-19 infection spread rapidly in Italy during the early months of 2020.
32275775,Infection can vary in severity from asymptomatic disease to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan failure.
32275775,The COVID-19 pandemic represents a severe stress test for the national health system.
32275775,Very quickly hospitals have had to assist a large and unexpected number of patients owing to the rapid spread of the disease.
32275775,This has led to a sudden shortage of hospital beds, medical and nursing staff, personal protective equipment (PPE), and ventilators.
32275775,Entire hospitals have been converted into intensive care units, retired anesthesiologists have been called back to work, and specialists in other branches have been assigned to assist COVID-19 patients.
32275775,Only urgent and non-postponable medical services are guaranteed.
32275784,Evidence strongly supports that access to specialty gastroenterology or hepatology care in cirrhosis is associated with higher adherence to guideline-recommended care and improves clinical outcomes.
32275784,Presently, only about one half of acute care hospitalizations for cirrhosis-related complications result in inpatient specialty care and the current hepatology workforce cannot meet the demand of patients with liver disease nationwide, particularly in less densely populated areas and in community-based practices not affiliated with academic centers.
32275784,Telemedicine, defined as the delivery of health care services at a distance using electronic means for diagnosis and treatment, holds tremendous promise to increase access to broadly specialty care.
32275784,The technology is cheap and easy to use, however, is presently limited in scale by interstate licensing restrictions and reimbursement barriers.
32275784,The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has, in the short-term, accelerated the growth of telemedicine delivery as a public health and social distancing measure.
32275784,Herein, we examine whether this public health crisis can accelerate the national conversation about broader adoption of telemedicine for routine medical care in non-crisis situations using a case series from our telehepatology program as a pragmatic example.
32275805,Emergency departments (EDs) fulfil a frontline function during public health emergencies (PHEs) and will play a pivotal role during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32275805,This perspective article draws on qualitative data from a longitudinal, ethnographic study of an Australian tertiary ED to illustrate the clinical and ethical challenges faced by EDs during PHEs.
32275805,Interview data collected during the 2014 Ebola Virus Disease PHE of International Concern suggests that ED clinicians have a strong sense of professional responsibility, but this can be compromised by increased visibility of risk and sub-optimal engagement from hospital managers and public health authorities.
32275805,The study exposes the tension between a healthcare worker's right to protection and a duty to provide treatment.
32275805,Given the narrow window of opportunity to prepare for a surge of COVID-19 presentations, there is an immediate need to reflect and learn from previous experiences.
32275805,To maintain the confidence of ED clinicians, and minimise the risk of moral injury, hospital and public health authorities must urgently develop processes to support ethical healthcare delivery and ensure adequate resourcing of EDs.

32275812,Remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue prodrug that inhibits viral RNA polymerases, has shown in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2.
32275812,We provided remdesivir on a compassionate-use basis to patients hospitalized with Covid-19, the illness caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2.
32275812,Patients were those with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who had an oxygen saturation of 94% or less while they were breathing ambient air or who were receiving oxygen support.
32275812,Patients received a 10-day course of remdesivir, consisting of 200 mg administered intravenously on day 1, followed by 100 mg daily for the remaining 9 days of treatment.
32275812,This report is based on data from patients who received remdesivir during the period from January 25, 2020, through March 7, 2020, and have clinical data for at least 1 subsequent day.
32275812,Of the 61 patients who received at least one dose of remdesivir, data from 8 could not be analyzed (including 7 patients with no post-treatment data and 1 with a dosing error).
32275812,Of the 53 patients whose data were analyzed, 22 were in the United States, 22 in Europe or Canada, and 9 in Japan.
32275812,At baseline, 30 patients (57%) were receiving mechanical ventilation and 4 (8%) were receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.
32275812,During a median follow-up of 18 days, 36 patients (68%) had an improvement in oxygen-support class, including 17 of 30 patients (57%) receiving mechanical ventilation who were extubated.
32275812,A total of 25 patients (47%) were discharged, and 7 patients (13%) died; mortality was 18% (6 of 34) among patients receiving invasive ventilation and 5% (1 of 19) among those not receiving invasive ventilation.
32275812,In this cohort of patients hospitalized for severe Covid-19 who were treated with compassionate-use remdesivir, clinical improvement was observed in 36 of 53 patients (68%).
32275812,Measurement of efficacy will require ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled trials of remdesivir therapy.
32275812,(Funded by Gilead Sciences.).
32275914,Type 1 interferons have a broad antiviral activity in vitro and are currently evaluated in a clinical trial to treat MERS-CoV.
32275914,In this review, we discuss preliminary data concerning the potential activity of type 1 interferons on SARS-CoV-2, and the relevance of evaluating these molecules in clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19.
32276097,Ageing adults (65+) with disability are especially vulnerable to COVID-19 and upon contracting, are a cohort most likely to require palliative care.
32276097,Therefore, it is very important that health services - particularly health services providing palliative care - are proximately available.
32276097,Treating the Melbourne metropolitan area as a case-study, a spatial analysis was conducted to clarify priority areas with a significantly high percentage and number of ageing adults (65+) with disability, and high barriers to accessing primary health services.
32276097,After, travel times from priority areas to (i) palliative medicine, and (ii) hospital services were calculated.
32276097,The geographic dispersion of areas with people vulnerable to COVID-19 with poor access to palliative care and health services are clarified.
32276097,Unique methods of health service delivery are required to ensure that vulnerable populations in under-serviced metropolitan areas receive prompt and adequate care.
32276097,The spatial methodology employed can be implemented in different contexts to support evidence-based COVID-19 and pandemic palliative care service decisions.
32276099,The COVID-19 pandemic created a rapid and unprecedented shift in our medical system.
32276099,Medical providers, teams, and organizations have needed to shift their visits away from face-to-face visits and toward telehealth (both by phone and through video).
32276099,Palliative care teams who practice in the community setting are faced with a difficult task: How do we actively triage the most urgent visits while keeping our vulnerable patients safe from the pandemic?
32276099,The following are recommendations created by the Palo Alto Medical Foundation Palliative Care and Support Services team to help triage and coordinate for timely, safe, and effective palliative care in the community and outpatient setting during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
32276099,Patients are initially triaged based on location followed by acuity.
32276099,Interdisciplinary care is implemented using strict infection control guidelines in the setting of limited personal protective equipment (PPE) resources.
32276099,We implement thorough screening for COVID-19 symptoms at multiple levels before a patient is seen by a designated provider.
32276099,We recommend active triaging, communication, frequent screening for COVID-19 symptoms for palliative care patients been evaluated in the community setting.
32276099,An understanding of infection risk, mutual consent between designated providers, patients, and their families are crucial to maintaining safety while delivering community-based palliative care during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32276102,Symptom management and skilled communication with patients and families are essential clinical services in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.
32276102,While palliative care specialists have training in these skills, many front-line clinicians from other specialties do not.
32276102,It is imperative that all clinicians responding to the COVID-19 crisis have access to clinical tools to support symptom management and difficult patient and family communication.
32276137,It is an ugly fact that a significant amount of the world's population will contract SARS-CoV infection with the current spreading.
32276137,While specific treatment is not yet coming soon, individual risk assessment and management strategies are crucial.
32276137,The individual preventive and protective measures drive the personal risk of getting the disease.
32276137,Among the virus-contracted hosts, their different metabolic status, as determined by their diet, nutrition, age, sex, medical conditions, lifestyle, and environmental factors, govern the personal fate toward different clinical severity of COVID-19, from asymptomatic, mild, moderate, to death.
32276137,The careful individual assessment for the possible dietary, nutritional, medical, lifestyle, and environmental risks, together with the proper relevant risk management strategies, is the sensible way to deal with the pandemic of SARS-CoV-II.
32276140,Infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 can result in severe respiratory complications and death.
32276140,Patients with a compromised immune system are expected to be more susceptible to a severe disease course.
32276140,In this report we suggest that patients with systemic lupus erythematous might be especially prone to severe COVID-19 independent of their immunosuppressed state from lupus treatment.
32276140,Specially, we provide evidence in lupus to suggest hypomethylation and overexpression of ACE2, which is located on the X chromosome and encodes a functional receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein.
32276140,Oxidative stress induced by viral infections exacerbates the DNA methylation defect in lupus, possibly resulting in further ACE2 hypomethylation and enhanced viremia.
32276140,In addition, demethylation of interferon-regulated genes, NFκB, and key cytokine genes in lupus patients might exacerbate the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and increase the likelihood of cytokine storm.
32276140,These arguments suggest that inherent epigenetic dysregulation in lupus might facilitate viral entry, viremia, and an excessive immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
32276140,Further, maintaining disease remission in lupus patients is critical to prevent a vicious cycle of demethylation and increased oxidative stress, which will exacerbate susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection during the current pandemic.
32276140,Epigenetic control of the ACE2 gene might be a target for prevention and therapy in COVID-19.
32276453,The higher death rate caused by COVID-19 in older people, especially those with comorbidities, is a challenge for biomedical aging research.
32276453,Here we explore the idea that an exacerbated inflammatory response, in particular that mediated by IL-6, may drive the deleterious consequences of the infection.
32276453,Data shows that other RNA viruses, such as influenza virus, can display enhanced replication efficiency in senescent cells, suggesting that the accumulation of senescent cells with aging and age-related diseases may play a role in this phenomenon.
32276453,However, at present, we are completely unaware of the response to SARS-CoV and SARS-COV-2 occurring in senescent cells.
32276453,We deem that this is a priority area of research because it could lead to the development of several therapeutic strategies based on senotherapeutics or prevent unsuccessful attempts.
32276453,Two of these senotherapeutics, azithromycin and ruxolitinib, are currently undergoing testing for their efficacy in treating COVID-19.
32276453,The potential of these strategies is not only for ameliorating the consequences of the current emergence of SARS-CoV-2, but also for the future emergence of new viruses or mutated ones for which we are completely unprepared and for which no vaccines are available.
32276848,To determine the dynamic changes of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA in respiratory and fecal specimens in children with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32276848,From January 17, 2020 to February 23, 2020, three paediatric cases of COVID-19 were reported in Qingdao, Shandong Province, China.
32276848,Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment data were collected.
32276848,Patients were followed up to March 10, 2020, and dynamic profiles of nucleic acid testing results in throat swabs and fecal specimens were closely monitored.
32276848,Clearance of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory tract occurred within two weeks after abatement of fever, whereas viral RNA remained detectable in stools of pediatric patients for longer than 4 weeks.
32276848,Two children had fecal SARS-CoV-2 undetectable 20 days after throat swabs showing negative, while that of another child lagged behind for 8 days.
32276848,SARS-CoV-2 may exist in children's gastrointestinal tract for a longer time than respiratory system.
32276848,Persistent shedding of SARS-CoV-2 in stools of infected children raises the possibility that the virus might be transmitted through contaminated fomites.
32276848,Massive efforts should be made at all levels to prevent spreading of the infection among children after reopening of kindergartens and schools.
32276929,TMPRSS2 is both the most frequently altered gene in primary prostate cancer and a critical factor enabling cellular infection by coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2.
32276929,The modulation of its expression by sex steroids could contribute to the male predominance of severe infections and given that TMPRSS2 has no known indispensable functions, and inhibitors are available, it is an appealing target for prevention or treatment of respiratory viral infections.
32276930,Amid concerns over the spread of COVID-19, oncology practices have &quot;gone virtual,&quot; with video appointments scheduled for any service that does not require diagnostic testing or treatment.
32277040,A novel coronavirus (COVID-19 virus) outbreak has caused a global pandemic resulting in tens of thousands of infections and thousands of deaths worldwide.
32277040,The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, also named nsp12) is the central component of coronaviral replication/transcription machinery and appears to be a primary target for the antiviral drug, remdesivir.
32277040,We report the cryo-EM structure of COVID-19 virus full-length nsp12 in complex with cofactors nsp7 and nsp8 at 2.9-Å resolution.
32277040,In addition to the conserved architecture of the polymerase core of the viral polymerase family, nsp12 possesses a newly identified β-hairpin domain at its N terminus.
32277040,A comparative analysis model shows how remdesivir binds to this polymerase.
32277040,The structure provides a basis for the design of new antiviral therapeutics targeting viral RdRp.
32277065,The nucleotide analogue remdesivir is an investigational drug for the treatment of human coronavirus infection.
32277065,Remdesivir is a phosphoramidate prodrug and is known to target viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases.
32277065,In this issue, Gordon <i>et al.</i> identify that remdesivir acts as a delayed RNA chain terminator for MERS-CoV polymerase complexes.
32277351,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a clinical syndrome caused by a novel coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32277351,COVID-19 has spread rapidly worldwide and has been shown to have a wide spectrum of severity.
32277351,COVID-19 has become a public health emergency of relevant international concern, and it was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on 11 March, 2020.
32277351,SARS-CoV-2 infection in severe cases involves the host response as an important contributor to the disease process and tissue damage, mainly due to dysregulated and excessive innate immune responses.
32277351,The primary immune response leads to viral clearance in the majority of cases.
32277351,However, in a subgroup of patients, the secondary immune response may be exaggerated, leading to inflammatory-induced lung injury and other complications including pneumonitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, shock, organ failure, and potentially death.
32277351,Several cutaneous immune-mediated diseases, including psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and hidradenitis suppurativa, are therapeutically managed with biologic and non-biologic immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory drugs.
32277351,The outbreak of COVID-19 affects the management of these chronic conditions, not only for those who are already receiving treatment but also for those who are about to start a new treatment to control their disease.
32277351,In this article, the management of cutaneous immune-mediated diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic is discussed.
32277367,The ongoing pandemic coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a matter of global concern.
32277367,Environmental factors such as air pollution and smoking and comorbid conditions (hypertension, diabetes mellitus and underlying cardio-respiratory illness) likely increase the severity of COVID-19.
32277367,Rheumatic manifestations such as arthralgias and arthritis may be prevalent in about a seventh of individuals.
32277367,COVID-19 can result in acute interstitial pneumonia, myocarditis, leucopenia (with lymphopenia) and thrombocytopenia, also seen in rheumatic diseases like lupus and Sjogren's syndrome.
32277367,Severe disease in a subset of patients may be driven by cytokine storm, possibly due to secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), akin to that in systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis or adult-onset Still's disease.
32277367,In the absence of high-quality evidence in this emerging disease, understanding of pathogenesis may help postulate potential therapies.
32277367,Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) appears important for viral entry into pneumocytes; dysbalance in ACE2 as caused by ACE inhibitors or ibuprofen may predispose to severe disease.
32277367,Preliminary evidence suggests potential benefit with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine.
32277367,Antiviral drugs like lopinavir/ritonavir, favipiravir and remdesivir are also being explored.
32277367,Cytokine storm and secondary HLH might require heightened immunosuppressive regimens.
32277367,Current international society recommendations suggest that patients with rheumatic diseases on immunosuppressive therapy should not stop glucocorticoids during COVID-19 infection, although minimum possible doses may be used.
32277367,Disease-modifying drugs should be continued; cessation may be considered during infection episodes as per standard practices.
32277367,Development of a vaccine may be the only effective long-term protection against this disease.Key Points• Patients with coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) may have features mimicking rheumatic diseases, such as arthralgias, acute interstitial pneumonia, myocarditis, leucopenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia and cytokine storm with features akin to secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.
32277367,• Although preliminary results may be encouraging, high-quality clinical trials are needed to better understand the role of drugs commonly used in rheumatology like hydroxychloroquine and tocilizumab in COVID-19.
32277367,• Until further evidence emerges, it may be cautiously recommended to continue glucocorticoids and other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in patients receiving these therapies, with discontinuation of DMARDs during infections as per standard practice.
32277387,Annually, around 850 liver transplantation is performed in Beijing, China.
32277387,Recently, the new coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) caused by 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has affected nearly 200 countries worldwide. 2019-nCov can cause severe lung disease, multiple-organ damage, and significant mortalities.
32277387,Liver transplant recipients, because of long-term oral immunosuppressant effects, may be more susceptible to 2019-nCoV infection and have a worse prognosis than the general population.
32277387,It is urgent to set up guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19 in liver transplant recipients.
32277387,In this article, we reviewed the clinical aspects of 2019-nCoV infection, characteristics of liver transplant recipients, immunosuppressant usage, and potential drug interactions to provide recommendations to clinical staff managing liver transplant recipients during the COVID-19 epidemic.
32277408,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been demonstrated to be the cause of pneumonia.
32277408,Nevertheless, it has not been reported as the cause of acute myocarditis or fulminant myocarditis.
32277408,A 63-year-old male was admitted with pneumonia and cardiac symptoms.
32277408,He was genetically confirmed as having COVID-19 according to sputum testing on the day of admission.
32277408,He also had elevated troponin I (Trop I) level (up to 11.37 g/L) and diffuse myocardial dyskinesia along with a decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) on echocardiography.
32277408,The highest level of interleukin-6 was 272.40 pg/ml.
32277408,Bedside chest radiographs showed typical ground-glass changes indicative of viral pneumonia.
32277408,Laboratory test results for viruses that cause myocarditis were all negative.
32277408,The patient conformed to the diagnostic criteria of the Chinese expert consensus statement for fulminant myocarditis.
32277408,After receiving antiviral therapy and mechanical life support, Trop I was reduced to 0.10 g/L, and interleukin-6 was reduced to 7.63 pg/mL.
32277408,Moreover, the LVEF of the patient gradually recovered to 68%.
32277408,The patient died of aggravation of secondary infection on the 33rd day of hospitalization.
32277408,COVID-19 patients may develop severe cardiac complications such as myocarditis and heart failure.
32277408,This is the first report of COVID-19 complicated with fulminant myocarditis.
32277408,The mechanism of cardiac pathology caused by COVID-19 needs further study.
32277490,Even though the global COVID-19 pandemic may affect how medical care is delivered in general, most countries try to maintain steady access for women to routine pregnancy care, including fetal anomaly screening.
32277490,This means that, also during this pandemic, fetal anomalies will be detected, and that discussions regarding invasive genetic testing and possibly fetal therapy will need to take place.
32277490,For patients, concerns about Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV2) will add to the anxiety caused by the diagnosis of a serious fetal anomaly, and for fetal medicine teams the situation gets more complex.
32277490,Yet also for fetal medicine teams the situation gets more complex as they must weigh up the risks and benefits to the fetus as well as the mother, while managing a changing evidence base and logistic challenges in their healthcare system.

32277555,An ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in Wuhan, China, with cases now confirmed in multiple countries.
32277555,The clinical course of patients remains to be fully characterized, clinical presentation ranges from asymptomatic infection to acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute renal failure，no pharmacological therapies of proven efficacy yet exist.
32277555,We report a case of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a renal transplant recipient with excellent outcome.
32277555,This case states the importance of close monitoring of the concentration of ciclosporin in patients treated with lopinavir/ritonavir, routine treatment of corticosteroid can be continued.
32277555,This is a rare report of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a renal transplant recipient.
32277555,Further data are needed to achieve better understanding of the impact of immunosuppressive therapy on the clinical presentation, severity and outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infections in solid organ transplant recipients.
32277836,Respiratory failure in COVID-19 is a common feature in fatal cases and has been considered as a failure of the immune system to control the virus.
32277836,Here we report the case of COVID-19 affecting an immunocompromised women and her presumably immunocompetent spouse.
32277836,A married couple (age 60 years) was simultaneously admitted to the emergency department on 10 March 2020 because of dyspnoea and fever, consistent with COVID-19.
32277836,The wife (patient 1) was partially immunocompromised as a consequence of a recently started chemotherapy with fulvestrant and abemaciclid for recurring breast cancer, her husband (patient 2) had been healthy except for a history of controlled arterial hypertension.
32277836,Both patients were treated with darunavir/cobicistat and hydroxychloroquine.
32277836,The clinical course of the immunocompromised partner was benign, without need of intensive care.
32277836,She was able to leave the hospital on day 6 after admission.
32277836,In contrast, her husband needed intensive care and his recovery was slow, although eventually successful too.
32277836,These findings suggest that the course of COVID-19 is not necessarily ominous in the presence of a compromised immune response and tend to reinforce the emerging therapeutic concepts of a controlled mitigation of the immune cascade following SARS CoV-2 infection.
32277967,To explore the significance of SAA in evaluating the severity and prognosis of COVID-19.
32277967,A total of 132 patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to a designated COVID-19 hospital in Wuhan, China from January 18, 2020 to February 26, 2020 were collected.
32277967,The dynamic changes of blood SAA, CRP, PCT, WBC, Lymphocyte (L), PLT, CT imaging, and disease progression were studied.
32277967,All patients completed at least twice laboratory data collection and clinical condition assessment at three time points indicated for this study; The length of hospital stay was longer than 14 days prior to February 26, 2020.
32277967,COVID-19 patients had significantly increased SAA and CRP levels, while L count decreased, and PCT, WBC, and PLT were in the normal range.
32277967,As disease progressed from mild to critically severe, SAA and CRP gradually increased, while L decreased, and PLT, WBC, and PCT had no significant changes; ROC curve analysis suggests that SAA/L, CRP, SAA, and L count are valuable in evaluating the severity of COVID-19 and distinguishing critically ill patients from mild ones; Patients with SAA consistently trending down during the course of disease have better prognosis, compared with the patients with SAA continuously rising; The initial SAA level is positively correlated with the dynamic changes of the serial CT scans.
32277967,Patient with higher initial SAA level are more likely to have poor CT imaging.
32277967,SAA and L are sensitive indicators in evaluating the severity and prognosis of COVID-19.
32277967,Monitoring dynamic changes of SAA, combined with CT imaging could be valuable in diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.
32278065,The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 / COVID-19) pandemic is a worldwide emergency.
32278065,An increasing number of diarrhea cases is reported.
32278065,Here we investigate the epidemiology, clinical presentation, molecular mechanisms, management, and prevention of SARS-CoV-2 associated diarrhea.
32278065,We searched on PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science up to March 2020 to identify studies documenting diarrhea and mechansism of intestinal inflammation in patients with confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32278065,Clinical studies show an incidence rate of diarrhea ranging from 2% to 50% of cases.
32278065,It may precede or trail respiratory symptoms.
32278065,A pooled analysis revealed an overall percentage of diarrhea onset of 10.4%.
32278065,SARS-CoV uses the the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming.
32278065,ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are not only expressed in lung, but also in the small intestinal epithelia.
32278065,ACE2 is expressed furthermore in the upper esophagus, liver, and colon.
32278065,SARS-CoV-2 binding affinity to ACE2 is significantly higher (10-20 times) compared with SARS-CoV.
32278065,Several reports indicate viral RNA shedding in stool detectable longer time period than in nasopharyngeal swabs.
32278065,Current treatment is supportive, but several options appear promising and are the subject of investigation.
32278065,Diarrhea is a frequent presenting symptom in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.
32278065,Increasing evidence indicates possible fecal oral transmission, indicating the need for a rapid and effective modification of the screening and diagnostic algorithms.
32278065,The optimal methods to prevent, manage, and treat diarrhea in COVID-19 infected patients are subjects of intensive research.
32278097,Cases of COVID-19 are escalating rapidly across the globe, with the mortality risk being especially high among those with existing illness and multimorbidity.
32278097,This study aimed to synthesise evidence for the role and response of palliative care and hospice teams to viral epi/pandemics, to inform the COVID-19 pandemic response.
32278097,We conducted a rapid systematic review according to PRISMA guidelines in five databases.
32278097,Of 3094 papers identified, ten were included in this narrative synthesis.
32278097,Included studies were from West Africa, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, the United States and Italy.
32278097,All had an observational design.
32278097,Findings were synthesised using a previously proposed framework according to 'systems' (policies, training and protocols, communication and coordination, data), 'staff' (deployment, skill mix, resilience), 'space' (community provision, use of technology) and 'stuff' (medicines and equipment, personal protective equipment).
32278097,We conclude that hospice and palliative services have an essential role in the response to COVID-19 by: 1) responding rapidly and flexibly; 2) ensuring protocols for symptom management are available, and training non-specialists in their use; 3) being involved in triage; 4) considering shifting resources into the community; 5) considering redeploying volunteers to provide psychosocial and bereavement care; 6) facilitating camaraderie among staff and adopt measures to deal with stress; 7) using technology to communicate with patients and carers; 8) adopting standardised data collection systems to inform operational changes and improve care.
32278175,The novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-CoV-2, which is the causative agent of a potentially fatal disease that is of great global public health concern.
32278175,The outbreak of COVID-19 is wreaking havoc worldwide due to inadequate risk assessment regarding the urgency of the situation.
32278175,The COVID-19 pandemic has entered a dangerous new phase.
32278175,When compared with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has spread more rapidly, due to increased globalization and adaptation of the virus in every environment.
32278175,Slowing the spread of the COVID-19 cases will significantly reduce the strain on the healthcare system of the country by limiting the number of people who are severely sick by COVID-19 and need hospital care.
32278175,Hence, the recent outburst of COVID-19 highlights an urgent need for therapeutics targeting SARS-CoV-2.
32278175,Here, we have discussed the structure of virus; varying symptoms among COVID-19, SARS, MERS and common flu; the probable mechanism behind the infection and its immune response.
32278175,Further, the current treatment options, drugs available, ongoing trials and recent diagnostics for COVID-19 have been discussed.
32278175,We suggest traditional Indian medicinal plants as possible novel therapeutic approaches, exclusively targeting SARS-CoV-2 and its pathways.
32278693,The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, better known as COVID-19 has become the current health concern to the entire world.
32278693,Initially appeared in Wuhan, China around December 2019, it had spread to almost 187 countries due to its high contagious nature.
32278693,Precautionary measures remain the sole obliging tactic to cease the person to person transmissions till any effective method of treatment or vaccine is developed.
32278693,Amidst the pandemic, research and development of new molecule is labour-intensive and tedious process.
32278693,Drug repurposing is the concept of identifying therapeutically potent molecule from the library of pre-existing molecules.
32278693,In the present study, 61 molecules that are already being used in clinics or under clinical scrutiny as antiviral agents are surveyed via docking study.
32278693,Docking study was performed using Maestro interface (Schrödinger Suite, LLC, NY).
32278693,Out of these 61 molecules, 37 molecules were found to interact with &gt;2 protein structures of COVID-19.
32278693,The docking results indicate that amongst the reported molecules, HIV protease inhibitors and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitors showed promising features of binding to COVID-19 enzyme.
32278693,Along with these, Methisazone an inhibitor of protein synthesis, CGP42112A an angiotensin AT2 receptor agonist and ABT450 an inhibitor of the non-structural protein 3-4A might become convenient treatment option as well against COVID-19.
32278693,The drug repurposing approach provide an insight about the therapeutics that might be helpful in treating corona virus disease.
32278716,Patients with structural heart disease (SHD) are at increased risk of adverse outcomes from the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) due to advanced age and comorbidity.
32278716,In the midst of a global pandemic of a novel infectious disease, reality-based considerations comprise an important starting point for formulating clinical management pathways.
32278716,The aim of these &quot;crisis-driven&quot; recommendations is (1) to ensure appropriate and timely treatment of SHD patients, (2) to minimize the risk of COVID-19 exposure to patients and healthcare workers, and (3) to limit resource utilization under conditions of constraint.
32278716,While the degree of disruption to usual practice will vary across the United States and elsewhere, we hope that early experiences from a Heart Team operating in the current global epicenter of COVID-19 may prove useful for others adapting their practice in advance of local surges of COVID-19.
32278725,Hospitals have severely curtailed the performance of non-urgent surgical procedures in anticipation of the need to redeploy healthcare resources to meet the projected massive medical needs of patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32278725,Surgical treatment of non-COVID-19 related disease during this period, however, still remains necessary.
32278725,The decision to proceed with Medically-Necessary, Time-Sensitive (MeNTS) procedures in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic requires incorporation of factors (resource limitations, COVID-19 transmission risk to providers and patients) heretofore not overtly considered by surgeons in the already complicated processes of clinical judgment and shared decision-making.
32278725,We describe a scoring system that systematically integrates these factors to facilitate decision-making and triage for MeNTS procedures and appropriately weighs individual patient risks with the ethical necessity of optimizing public health concerns.
32278725,This approach is applicable across a broad range of hospital settings (academic and community, urban and rural) in the midst of the pandemic and may be able to inform case triage as OR capacity resumes once the acute phase of the pandemic subsides.
32278764,We aimed to briefly review the general characteristics of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and provide a better understanding of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in people with diabetes, and its management.
32278764,We searched for articles in PubMed and Google Scholar databases till 02 April 2020, with the following keywords: &quot;SARS-CoV-2&quot;, &quot;COVID-19&quot;, &quot;infection&quot;, &quot;pathogenesis&quot;, &quot;incubation period&quot;, &quot;transmission&quot;, &quot;clinical features&quot;, &quot;diagnosis&quot;, &quot;treatment&quot;, &quot;diabetes&quot;, with interposition of the Boolean operator &quot;AND&quot;.
32278764,The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 is heterogeneous, ranging from mild flu-like symptoms to acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiple organ failure and death.
32278764,Older age, diabetes and other comorbidities are reported as significant predictors of morbidity and mortality.
32278764,Chronic inflammation, increased coagulation activity, immune response impairment, and potential direct pancreatic damage by SARS-CoV-2 might be among the underlying mechanisms of the association between diabetes and COVID-19.
32278764,No conclusive evidence exists to support the discontinuation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), angiotensin receptor blockers or thiazolidinediones because of COVID-19 in people with diabetes.
32278764,Caution should be taken to potential hypoglycemic events with the use of chloroquine in these subjects.
32278764,Patient tailored therapeutic strategies, rigorous glucose monitoring and careful consideration of drug interactions might reduce adverse outcomes.
32278764,Suggestions are made on the possible pathophysiological mechanisms of the relationship between diabetes and COVID-19, and its management.
32278764,No definite conclusions can be made based on current limited evidence.
32278764,Further research regarding this relationship and its clinical management is warranted.
32278766,Clinical pharmacists' routine task is carrying out pharmaceutical care to ensure patients' safe and reasonable medication use.
32278766,However, under public health emergencies, such as the outbreak of COVID-19, the work strategies of clinical pharmacists need to be modified according to the rapid spread of the disease, where information and resources are usually lack to guide them.
32278766,To retrieve and investigate the prevention and control measures of clinical pharmacists during the outbreak of novel coronavirus, summarize the roles and responsibilities of clinical pharmacists, and to propose innovative strategies for developing pharmacy services under the epidemic.
32278766,The Chinese and English databases, self-media network, website of professional society or medical institution, and clinical trial center platforms were searched, and clinical pharmacists involved in the work against COVID-19 were surveyed and interviewed.
32278766,Investigate the challenges and needs of frontline medical staffs for treating patients, and formulate strategies based on the actual medical environment.
32278766,Clinical pharmacists play a vital role in leading the industry to formulate work instructions, provide frontline medical staff with drug information, and develop innovative pharmacy services to promote the rational use of medicines with collaborative teamwork and close communication according to the epidemic situation of COVID-19.
32278766,Anti-epidemic work indeed has driven the development of remote pharmacy services.
32278766,Facing public health emergencies, clinical pharmacists can give full play to their professional expertise, analyze the current situation rationally, formulate telehealth strategies swiftly, and work in a united and efficient manner to provide innovative pharmacy services to ensure medication safety and rational use of medicine.
32278811,Given the extreme importance of the current pandemic caused by COVID-19, and due to the fact that scientists agree that there is no identified pharmacological treatment where possible therapeutic alternatives are raised through drug repositioning.
32278811,We present a selection of studies involving drugs from different pharmaceutical classes with activity against SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-Cov, with potential use in the treatment of COVID-19 disease.
32278865,A rapidly expanding epidemic of the new coronavirus has become the focus of global scientific attention.
32278865,Data are lacking on impact of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on Health-Related Quality of Life among patients affected by Primary Antibody Deficiencies. to identify factors impacting the Health-Related-Quality of Life among Italian patients affected by Primary Antibody Deficiencies switched to remote assistance at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic.
32278865,Survey on quality of life in 158 Primary Antibody Deficiency patients measured by the CVID_QoL, a disease-specific tool, and by the GHQ-12, a generic tool to assess the risk of anxiety/depression.
32278865,Since the beginning of COVID-19 epidemic, we shifted all PAD patients to home therapy, and activated remote visits.
32278865,Questionnaires were sent by email four weeks later.
32278865,CVID_QoL and GHQ-12 data scores were compared with the same set of data from a survey done in 2017.
32278865,Of 210 patients, 158 (75%) agreed to participate.
32278865,The quality of life worse in the group of patients who become at risk of anxiety/depression at the study time.
32278865,Health-Related-Quality of Life was similar in patients forced to shift from hospital-based to home-based immunoglobulin treatment and in patients who continued their usual home-based replacement.
32278865,The risk of anxiety/depression is associated to SARS-CoV-2 pandemia and to patients' fragility, and not to related clinical conditions associated with Common Variable Immune Deficiencies.
32278865,The anxiety to run out of medications is a major new issue.
32278865,COVID-19 epidemic impacted HRQoL and the risk of anxiety/depression of PAD patients.
32278865,The remote assistance program was a useful possibility to limit personal contacts without influencing the HRQoL.
32278932,The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has severely affected medical treatment protocols throughout the world.
32278932,While the pandemic does not affect hand surgeons at first glance, they have a role to play.
32278932,The purpose of this study was to describe the different measures that have been put in place in response to the COVID-19 pandemic by hand surgeons throughout the world.
32278932,The survey comprised 47 surgeons working in 34 countries who responded to an online questionnaire.
32278932,We found that the protocols varied in terms of visitors, health professionals in the operating room, patient waiting areas, wards and emergency rooms.
32278932,Based on these preliminary findings, an international consensus on hand surgery practices for the current viral pandemic, and future ones, needs to be built rapidly.
32279064,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), though primarily a respiratory pathogen, also involves the gastrointestinal tract.
32279064,Similar to the respiratory mucosa, angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor and transmembrane serine protease 2 TMPRSS2) co-express in the gastrointestinal tract, which facilitates viral entry into the tissue.
32279064,Less than 10% of children with infection develop diarrhea and vomiting.
32279064,Prolonged RT PCR positivity in the stool has raised the possibility of feco-oral transmission.
32279064,Elevated transaminases are common, especially in those with severe coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID -19) disease.
32279064,Children with inflammatory bowel disease and post liver transplant patients do not have an increased risk of disease, and should remain on medications they are already on.
32279064,Children with chronic liver disease should continue their medications as usual.
32279064,All elective procedures like endoscopy should be postponed.
32279346,In patients with COIVD-19, in the early aggravation phase before treatment, observation of peripheral blood film shows the presence of pronounced morhological anomalies of the granulocyte series.
32279346,One week after the start of treatment, such anomalies subside, and an increasing proportion of reactive lymphocytes dominates.

32279418,During the novel coronavirus pandemic, organ transplant recipients represent a frail susceptible category due to long-term immunosuppressive therapy.
32279418,For this reason, clinical manifestations may differ from general population and different treatment approaches may be needed.
32279418,We present the case of a 36-year-old kidney transplanted woman affected by Senior-Loken syndrome diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia after a contact with her positive mother.
32279418,Initial symptoms were fatigue, dry cough and coryza; she never had fever nor oxygen supplementation.
32279418,Hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir were started, and the antiviral drug was replaced with darunavir/cobicistat after two days for diarrhea.
32279418,Immunosuppressant levels were closely monitored, and we observed very high tacrolimus trough levels despite initial dose reduction.
32279418,The patient was left with steroid therapy alone.
32279418,The peculiarity of clinical presentation and the management difficulties represent the flagship of our case-report.
32279418,We stress the need for guidelines in transplant recipients with COVID-19 infection with particular regard to the management of therapy.
32280433,The infection of a novel coronavirus found in Wuhan of China (SARS-CoV-2) is rapidly spreading, and the incidence rate is increasing worldwide.
32280433,Due to the lack of effective treatment options for SARS-CoV-2, various strategies are being tested in China, including drug repurposing.
32280433,In this study, we used our pre-trained deep learning-based drug-target interaction model called Molecule Transformer-Drug Target Interaction (MT-DTI) to identify commercially available drugs that could act on viral proteins of SARS-CoV-2.
32280433,The result showed that atazanavir, an antiretroviral medication used to treat and prevent the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is the best chemical compound, showing an inhibitory potency with <i>K<sub>d</sub></i> of 94.94 nM against the SARS-CoV-2 3C-like proteinase, followed by remdesivir (113.13 nM), efavirenz (199.17 nM), ritonavir (204.05 nM), and dolutegravir (336.91 nM).
32280433,Interestingly, lopinavir, ritonavir, and darunavir are all designed to target viral proteinases.
32280433,However, in our prediction, they may also bind to the replication complex components of SARS-CoV-2 with an inhibitory potency with <i>K<sub>d</sub></i>  &lt; 1000 nM.
32280433,In addition, we also found that several antiviral agents, such as Kaletra (lopinavir/ritonavir), could be used for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
32280433,Overall, we suggest that the list of antiviral drugs identified by the MT-DTI model should be considered, when establishing effective treatment strategies for SARS-CoV-2.
32280993,More than 4 million adults survive a stay in the intensive care unit each year, with many experiencing new or worsening physical disability, mental health problems, and/or cognitive impairments, known as the post-intensive care syndrome (PICS).
32280993,Given the prevalence and magnitude of physical impairments after critical illness, many survivors, including those recovering from COVID-19, could benefit from physical therapist services after hospital discharge.
32280993,However, due to the relatively recent recognition and characterization of PICS, there may be limited awareness and understanding of PICS among physical therapists practicing in home healthcare and community-based settings.
32280993,This lack of awareness may lead to inappropriate and/or inadequate rehabilitation service provision.
32280993,While this perspective article provides information relevant to all physical therapists, it is aimed toward those providing rehabilitation services outside of the acute and post-acute inpatient settings.
32280993,This article reports the prevalence and clinical presentation of PICS and provides recommendations for physical examination and outcomes measures, plan of care, and intervention strategies.
32280993,The importance of providing patient and family education, coordinating community resources including referring to other healthcare team members, and community-based rehabilitation service options is emphasized.
32280993,Finally, this perspective article discusses current challenges for optimizing outcomes for people with PICS and suggests future directions for research and practice.
32281052,&quot;COVID-19&quot; is the word that certainly isn't forgotten by everybody who lives in the first half of the twenty-first century.
32281052,COVID-19, as a pandemic, has led many researchers from different biomedical fields to find solutions or treatments to manage the pandemic.
32281052,However, no standard treatment for this disease has been discovered to date.
32281052,Probably, preventing the severe acute respiratory infection form of COVID-19 as the most dangerous phase of this disease can be helpful for the treatment and reduction of the death rate.
32281052,In this regard, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)-based immunomodulation treatment has been proposed as a suitable therapeutic approach and several clinical trials have begun.
32281052,Recently, MSCs according to their immunomodulatory and regenerative properties attract attention in clinical trials.
32281052,After the intravenous transplantation of MSCs, a significant population of cells accumulates in the lung, which they alongside immunomodulatory effect could protect alveolar epithelial cells, reclaim the pulmonary microenvironment, prevent pulmonary fibrosis, and cure lung dysfunction.
32281052,Given the uncertainties in this area, we reviewed reported clinical trials and hypotheses to provide useful information to researchers and those interested in stem cell therapy.
32281052,In this study, we considered this new approach to improve patient's immunological responses to COVID-19 using MSCs and discussed the aspects of this proposed treatment.
32281052,However, currently, there are no approved MSC-based approaches for the prevention and/or treatment of COVID-19 patients but clinical trials ongoing.
32281114,A case of late initiation of remdesivir antiviral therapy in the successful treatment of a patient with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in a mixed medical ICU of a community teaching hospital is presented.
32281114,A previously healthy 40 year-old male was admitted to the hospital three days after the onset of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms, including dry cough, fever, and shortness of breath progressing to intubation and increased mechanical ventilator support.
32281114,A request for compassionate use remdesivir was submitted on the same hospital day as the positive COVID-19 PCR result.
32281114,Supportive measures, in addition to a 5-day course of hydroxychloroquine, were maintained until remdesivir could be supplied on day 9 of hospitalization, 13 days after symptom onset.
32281114,Sixty hours after initiating remdesivir, the patient was successfully extubated and was able to transition to room air within 24 hours of extubation.
32281114,Late initiation of remdesivir may be effective in treating SARS-CoV-2, unlike antivirals utilized for different disease states, such as oseltamivir, which are most effective when started as soon as possible following symptom onset.
32281114,Urgent action is needed by regulatory agencies to work with drug manufacturers to expedite the study and approval of investigational agents targeting SARS-CoV-2 as well as to meet manufacturing demands.
32281214,A global coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic occurred at the start of 2020 and is already responsible for more than 74,000 deaths worldwide, just over 100 years after the influenza pandemic of 1918.
32281214,At the center of the crisis is the highly infectious and deadly SARS-CoV-2, which has altered everything from individual daily lives to the global economy and our collective consciousness.
32281214,Aside from the pulmonary manifestations of disease, there are likely to be several electrophysiologic (EP) sequelae of COVID-19 infection and its treatment, due to consequences of myocarditis and the use of QT-prolonging drugs.
32281214,Most crucially, the surge in COVID-19 positive patients that have already overwhelmed the New York City hospital system requires conservation of hospital resources including personal protective equipment (PPE), reassignment of personnel, and reorganization of institutions, including the EP laboratory.
32281214,In this proposal, we detail the specific protocol changes that our EP department has adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic, including performance of only urgent/emergent procedures, afterhours/7-day per week laboratory operation, single attending-only cases to preserve PPE, appropriate use of PPE, telemedicine and video chat follow-up appointments, and daily conferences to collectively manage the clinical and ethical dilemmas to come.
32281214,We discuss also discuss how we perform EP procedures on presumed COVID positive and COVID tested positive patients in order to highlight issues that others in the EP community may soon face in their own institution as the virus continues to spread nationally and internationally.

32281317,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 not yet has established its treatment, but convalescent plasma has been expected to increase survival rates as in the case with other emerging viral infections.
32281317,We describe two cases of COVID-19 treated with convalescent plasma infusion.
32281317,Both patients presented severe pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome and showed a favorable outcome after the use of convalescent plasma in addition to systemic corticosteroid.
32281317,To our knowledge, this is the first report of the use of convalescent plasma therapy for COVID-19 in Korea.
32281327,The coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) is raging in China and more than 20 other countries and regions since the middle of December 2019.
32281327,Currently, there is no specific drug or vaccine besides symptomatic supportive therapy.
32281327,Taking full advantage of the clinical experience of traditional Chinese medicine(TCM) in preventing and controlling major epidemics such as SARS, it is an important mission for TCM to propose effective formula with immediate response and solid evidence by using modern biomedical knowledge and techniques(molecular docking assisted TCM formulation for short).
32281327,In view of the high homology between the gene sequences of the novel coronavirus and SARS virus, and the similarities between the two in terms of pathogenic mechanism and clinical manifestations, our team established a rapid screening and optimization model for the prevention and treatment of the novel coronavirus based on clinical experience and molecular docking technology.
32281327,Firstly, the clinical team and the research team pre-developed and screened TCM formula by using &amp;quot;back-to-back&amp;quot; manner.
32281327,Then, the formula was optimized and determined by comparing and analyzing the results of the two groups.
32281327,The results showed that the research team screened out 46 active ingredients from candidate TCMs that could act on the novel coronavirus S-protein-binding site of human ACE2 protein, which were mainly attributed to 7 herbs such as Lonicerae Japonicae Flos and Mori Folium.
32281327,The result was largely consistent with the formula raised by the clinical group, verifying and supporting its rationality.
32281327,This provides evidence for the scientific and potential efficacy of the TCM prescription from the perspective of treatment target analysis, and also suggests that the TCM prescription has the potential to directly inhibit viral infection in addition to improving clinical symptoms or syndromes.
32281327,Based on this, our team optimized and formed a new anti-coronavirus TCM prescription &amp;quot;Keguan Yihao&amp;quot;, immediately providing the TCM prescription with certain clinical experience and objective evidence support for the prevention and treatment of new emergent infectious diseases in our hospital.
32281327,The TCM prescription was combined with modern medicine symptomatic supportive treatment for clinical treatment, preliminary results showed better effect than symptomatic supportive therapy alone.
32281327,This research has innovated the method mode in clinical practice and basic research integration of traditional Chinese medicine for the prevention and control of new emerging infectious diseases.
32281327,It is of great significance to further improve the rapid response mechanism of TCM in face of major epidemics, and further improve the capability level of TCM to prevent and treat new emerging infectious diseases.
32281328,With the rapid outbreak of COVID-19, traditional Chinese medicine(TCM) has been playing an active role against the epidemic.
32281328,However, the screening of TCM is limited by the development cycle and laboratory conditions, which greatly limits the screening speed.
32281328,This study established optimization docking models and virtual screening to discovery potential active herbs for the prevention and treatment of the novel coronavirus based on molecular docking technology.
32281328,The crystal structures of 3 CL protease(Mpro) and papain-like protease(PLP) were obtained from PDB database and homologous modeling respectively, and were used to conduct virtual screening of TCMD 2009 database by CDOCKER program.
32281328,The ingredients scored in the top 100 were selected respectively, and the candidate herbs were ranked by the numbers of hit molecules.
32281328,Based on Mpro inhibitors screening, 12 322 potential active components were obtained, and the representative active components included aster pentapeptide A, ligustrazine, salvianolic acid B, etc., and Zingiberis Rhizoma Recens, Asteris Radix et Rhizoma, Notoginseng Radix et Rhizoma, Chuanxiong Rhizoma, Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix et Rhizoma, Zingiberis Rhizoma, Dianthi Herba, Rhei Radix et Rhizoma, Cistanches Herba were obtained.
32281328,While 11 294 potential active ingredients were obtained by PLP inhibitor screening, representative active ingredients included gingerketophenol, ginkgol alcohol, ferulic acid, etc., and Codonopsis Radix, Notopterygii Rhizoma et Radix, Zingiberis Rhizoma Recens, Ginkgo Semen, Chuanxiong Rhizoma, Trichosanthis Fructus, Paeoniae Radix Alba, Psoraleae Fructus, Sophorae Flavescentis Radix, Notoginseng Radix et Rhizoma, Angelicae Sinensis Radix were chosen.
32281328,By combining the diagnosis and treatment scheme of Hunan province's and angiotensin converting enzyme 2(ACE2) inhibitors screening from literature, present study also discussed the rational application of candidate herbs to this epidemic situation.
32281328,Trichosanthis Fructus obtained by PLP inhibitors screening and Fritillaria verticillata obtained by ACE2 inhibitors screening were parts of the Sangbei Zhisou Powder and Xiaoxianxiong Decoction, which might be applicable to the syndromes of cough and dyspnea.
32281328,Rhei Radix et Rhizoma screened by Mpro and Trichosanthis Fructus screened by PLP were contained in Maxing Shigan Decoction and Xuanbai Chengqi Decoction, and could be applied to the syndromes of epidemic virus blocking lung.
32281328,Mori Folium, Lonicerae Japonicae Flos and Forsythiae Fructus obtained by ACE2 inhibitors screening were included in the Sangju Decoction and Yinqiaosan, which might be applicable to the syndromes of warm pathogen attacking lung and cough and dyspnea.
32281328,The results of this study are intended to provide a reference for the further development of traditional Chinese medicine to deal with the new epidemic.
32281329,Since the outbreak of 2019-nCoV, the epidemic has developed rapidly and the situation is grim.
32281329,LANCET figured out that the 2019-nCoV is closely related to &amp;quot;cytokine storm&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;Cytokine storm&amp;quot; is an excessive immune response of the body to external stimuli such as viruses and bacteria.
32281329,As the virus attacking the body, it stimulates the secretion of a large number of inflammatory factors: interleukin(IL), interferon(IFN), C-X-C motif chemokine(CXCL) and so on, which lead to cytokine cascade reaction.
32281329,With the exudation of inflammatory factors, cytokines increase abnormally in tissues and organs, interfering with the immune system, causing excessive immune response of the body, resulting in diffuse damage of lung cells, pulmonary fibrosis, and multiple organ damage, even death.
32281329,Arachidonic acid(AA) metabolic pathway is principally used to synthesize inflammatory cytokines, such as monocyte chemotactic protein 1(MCP-1), tumor necrosis factor(TNF), IL, IFN, etc., which is closely related to the occurrence, development and regression of inflammation.
32281329,Therefore, the inhibition of AA metabolism pathway is benefit for inhibiting the release of inflammatory factors in the body and alleviating the &amp;quot;cytokine storm&amp;quot;.
32281329,Based on the pharmacophore models of the targets on AA metabolic pathway, the traditional Chinese medicine database 2009(TCMD 2009) was screened.
32281329,The potential herbs were ranked by the number of hit molecules, which were scored by pharmacophore fit value.
32281329,In the end, we obtained the potential active prescriptions on &amp;quot;cytokine storm&amp;quot; according to the potential herbs in the &amp;quot;National novel coronavirus pneumonia diagnosis and treatment plan(trial version sixth)&amp;quot;.
32281329,The results showed that the hit components with the inhibitory effect on AA were magnolignan Ⅰ, lonicerin and physcion-8-O-β-D-glucopy-ranoside, which mostly extracted from Magnoliae Officinalis Cortex, Zingiberis Rhizoma Recens, Lonicerae Japonicae Flos, Rhei Radix et Rhizoma, Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix et Rhizoma, Scutellariae Radix, Gardeniae Fructus, Ginseng Radix et Rhizoma, Arctii Fructus, Dryopteridis Crassirhizomatis Rhizoma, Paeoniaeradix Rubra, Dioscoreae Rhizoma.
32281329,Finally the anti-2019-nCoV prescriptions were analyzed to obtain the potential active prescriptions on AA metabolic pathway, Huoxiang Zhengqi Capsules, Jinhua Qinggan Granules, Lianhua Qingwen Capsules, Qingfei Paidu Decoction, Xuebijing Injection, Reduning Injection and Tanreqing Injection were found that may prevent 2019-nCoV via regulate cytokines.
32281329,This study intends to provide reference for clinical use of traditional Chinese medicine to resist new coronavirus.
32281330,To analyze the registered clinical trial protocols of traditional Chinese medicine(TCM) for the prevention and treatment of coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19), in order to provide information for improving the quality of research design.
32281330,The website of the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry(www.chictr.org.cn) and the American Clinical Trial Registry(clinicaltrials.gov) were searched to collect protocols of TCM for COVID-19.
32281330,Documents were screened following the inclusion criteria, and data were extracted in regard to registration date, study objective, type of design, sponsor, patient, sample size, intervention, and evaluation index.
32281330,Descriptive analysis was conducted.
32281330,A total of 49 clinical trial protocols of TCM for COVID-19 were included.
32281330,Primary sponsors were mainly hospitals or universities in places like Hubei, Beijing, Zhejiang and other regions.
32281330,The implementation units are mainly in Hubei, Guangdong, Zhejiang, Henan and other regional hospitals.
32281330,The types of study design were mainly experimental studies(40), including 30 randomized parallel controlled trials, 7 non-randomized controlled trials, 2 single arm trials and 1 consecutively recruited trial; besides, there were also 6 observational studies, 2 health service studies and 1 preventive study.
32281330,The sample size reached a total of 30 562 cases, with a maximum of 20 000 for a single study and a minimum of 30.
32281330,The 49 trials subjects included healthy people(3), isolation and observation cases(1), suspected cases(10),confirmed COVID-19 patients(31) and COVID-19 recovery patients(4).
32281330,Of the 31 trials planned to include confirmed COVID-19 patients, 16 protocols no definite disease classification, 3 with a clear exclusion of severe subjects, 4 with common subjects, 2 with light, common or severe subjects, 1 with light and common subjects, 1 with common or severe subjects, 3 with severe subjects, and 1 with severe or critical subjects.
32281330,The experimental interventions included Chinese patent medicine(Lianhua Qingwen Capsules/Granules, Huoxiang Zhengqi Dropping Pills/Oral Liquid, Babao Dan, Gubiao Jiedu Ling, Jinhao Jiere Granules, Compound Yu-xingcao Mixture, Jinye Baidu Granules, Shufeng Jiedu Capsuless, Shuanghuanglian Oral Liquid, Tanreqing Injection, Xuebijing Injection, Reduning Injection, Xiyanping Injection), Chinese medicinal decoction and taichi.
32281330,The primary evaluation outcomes mainly included antipyretic time, clinical symptom relief, novel coronavirus nucleic acid turning to negative, conversion rate of severe cases and chest CT.
32281330,There was a quick response of clinical research on the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 with TCM, with the current registered protocols covers the whole process of disease prevention, treatment and rehabilitation.
32281330,However, issues need to be concerned, including unclear definition of patient's condition, unclear research objectives, unclear intervention process and inappropriate outcomes, etc.
32281330,In addition, researchers should consider the actual difficulties and workload of doctors in epidemic response environment, and make effort to optimize the process and improve the operability of research protocols under the principle of medical ethics.
32281331,To investigate the regularity of prescription and clinical syndromes by analyzing the diagnosis and treatment protocols of traditional Chinese medicine(TCM) for coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19), so as to provide references for syndrome differentiation and relevant researches.
32281331,The diagnosis and treatment protocols of COVID-19 published by national and regional health authorities were searched, and information was extracted in regard to disease stages, type of syndromes, and prescriptions, etc.
32281331,Frequency statistics and relative analysis were used to analyze the rule of syndrome differentiation and prescription with TCM, and further discussion on the pathogenesis and progress of the disease.
32281331,A total of 26 diagnosis and treatment protocols of TCM for COVID-19 were retrieved after screening(including 1 national scheme and 25 regional ones), among which 16 contained aspects of both prevention and treatment, 7 only involved treatment contents and 3 were prevention schemes.
32281331,The courses of COVID-19 can be divided into early stage, middle stage, severe stage and recovery stage.
32281331,The pathogeny of COVID-19 in TCM is damp-toxin, with the core pathogenesis of damp-toxin retention in lung and Qi repression.
32281331,Its pathological features can be summarized as &amp;quot;damp, toxin, obstruction, deficiency&amp;quot;.
32281331,The location of the disease is lung, always involving spleen and stomach, and may further affect heart and kidney in severe cases.
32281331,The major treatments for each course are Fanghua Shizuo, Xuanfei Touxie(early stage); Qingre Jiedu, Xuanxie Feire(middle stage); Kaibi Gutuo, Huiyang Jiuni(severe stage); Qingjie Yure, Yiqi Yangyin(recovery stage).
32281331,There were many diagnosis and treatment protocols for COVID-19 have been published, which generally followed the national edition, through with certain personalities in different regional protocols.
32281331,There were common features with respect to the disease stage, syndrome differentiation, therapeutic principles and methods, as well as prescriptions; the treatment were generally carried out against the core pathogenesis and progress of the disease.
32281331,Along with the deepening recognition of COVID-19, the diagnosis and treatment protocols are still need further concretization and standardization.
32281331,We hope researchers and decision-makers can pay more attention to the treatment of Huayu Tongluo in severe and recovery period.
32281332,The coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) is developing rapidly and posing great threat to public health.
32281332,There is no specific medicine available for treating the disease.
32281332,Luckily, traditional Chinese medicine has played a positive role in the fighting against COVID-19.
32281332,In this paper, We collected and sorted the prescriptions of modern Chinese medicine for COVID-19 released by national government, different provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities, as well as online databases, such as CNKI, WanFang medical network, and VIP database.
32281332,These prescriptions were combined with the inheritance of traditional Chinese medicine auxiliary V2.5, and the complex system entropy clustering method was used to determine the association rules and frequency of single drug and drug combination in the prescription.
32281332,In the end, 96 effective prescriptions were included.
32281332,Among them, the four properties were mainly concentrated in temperature, cold and level, the five tastes were mainly concentrated in bitter, hot and sweet, and the meridians were mainly concentrated in lung, stomach and spleen.
32281332,The high-frequency drugs were Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma, Armeniacae Semen Amarum, Gypsum Fibrosum, etc., and the high-frequency combinations are Gypsum Fibrosum-Armeniacae Semen Amarum, Gypsum Fibrosum-Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma, Armeniacae Semen Amarum-Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma, the core combinations are Lepidii Semen-Armeniacae Semen Amarum-Gypsum Fibrosum, Pogostemonis Herba-Zingiberis Rhizoma Recens-Magnoliae Officinalis Cortex, Ophiopogonis Radix-Armeniacae Semen Amarum-Scutellariae Radix and so on.
32281332,Form new prescriptions Lepidii Semen, Armeniacae Semen Amarum, Gypsum Fibrosum, Pogostemonis Herba, Zingiberis Rhizoma Recens, Magnoliae Officinalis Cortex.
32281332,Ophiopogonis Radix, Armeniacae Semen Amarum, Scutellariae Radix, Schisandrae Sphenantherae Fructus, Panacis Quinquefolii Radix.
32281332,From the medicinal properties to high-frequency drugs and new prescriptions, it could be seen that the overall treatment of COVID-19 by traditional Chinese medicine was to strengthen body resistance, eliminate pathogenic factors, and give attention to Qi and Yin.
32281333,Coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) triggered a severe and complicated epidemic situation, and it is of great significance to discuss the rules and characteristics of the prescription of COVID-19 in traditional Chinese medicine.
32281333,This study collected prevention and treatment approaches of traditional Chinese medicine for COVID-19 released from the National Health Committee of China, 7 provinces and municipal health committees, the Chinese Medicine Administration and Handbook of Traditional Chinese Medicine Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 between January 1 and February 18, 2020, and prescriptions prepared by 3 masters of Chinese medicine and 4 well-known Chinese medicine experts.
32281333,These information were selected according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and EpiData 3.0 software was used to establish the &amp;quot;Traditional Chinese Medicine Prescription Library for the Prevention and Treatment of COVID-19&amp;quot; and the &amp;quot;Common Database of Traditional Chinese Medicine for the Prevention and Treatment of COVID-19&amp;quot;.
32281333,A total of 93 effective Chinese medicine prescriptions and a total of 157 kinds of constituent medicines were collected.
32281333,Data analysis was performed by SPSS 18.0 software.
32281333,The results showed that: ①most of the medicines are with cold and warm properties, 69 with cold medicines, accounting for 43.95%, 57 with warm medicines, accounting for 36.31%, and less with hot medicines, taking up 1.27%; ②there are many pungent, bitter and sweet medicines, and the distribution of medicinal flavors is different at different disease stage.
32281333,The pungent medicines are mostly found in the early stage, the bitter drugs are the main flavor in the middle and severe stage, and the sweet medicines are mostly used in the recovery stage; ③the meridian of the drug is more concentrated at the lung, stomach, and heart, and most of drugs are into the lung meridian, accounting for 24.55%; these medicines are mostly into the lungs and stomach in the initial and middle stages, and into the heart and kidney in severe stages; ④oral drugs are mostly non-toxic, among which only 6 kinds are toxic, namely Armeniacae Semen Amarum, Dryopteridis Crassirhizomatis Rhizoma, Paridis Rhizoma, Pinelliae Rhizoma, Aconiti Lateralis Radix Praeparaia; ⑤most of the drugs have five types of functions: treating exterior syndromes, resolving dampness, clearing heat, replenishing deficiency, resolving phlegm, cough, and asthma.
32281333,In the early stage, both drugs for treating exterior syndromes and heat clearing drugs were equally used, accounting for 18.81% each.
32281333,In the middle stage, drugs resolving phlegm, cough, and asthma drugs are more often used, accounting for 29.61%.
32281333,In the severe stage, heat clearing drugs are mostly used, accounting for 33.33%.
32281333,During the recovery period, tonic deficiency drugs are used the most, accounting for 36.47%.
32281333,The medical characteristics and efficacy of Chinese medicine in preventing and treating COVID-19 are closely related to the understanding of the etiology of Chinese medicine and the location and pathogenesis of the disease.
32281333,Staged medication and local conditions need attention during the identification and treatment of COVID-19 clinical syndromes.
32281334,The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) seriously endangers people's health.
32281334,Traditional Chinese medicine(TCM) has been recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Strategy, which have made outstanding contributions to the prevention and control of the epidemic.
32281334,The wide application of Chinese medicine asked the pharmacists and doctors, nurses, and medical technicians in Wuhan and around the country to stand on the front line of COVID-19 treatment, and provide pharmaceutical care services, which has effectively guaranteed the safety and rational use of Chinese medicine.
32281334,This article will introduce the TCM cognition of the COVID-19, analyze the clinical application of Chinese medicine and the entry point of pharmaceutical care, and clarify that clinical Chinese pharmacists can participate in making medication therapy plan, medication reconciliation, and prescription review, promoting rational drug use, pharmaceutical monitoring, and drug risk management.
32281334,The participation of clinical Chinese pharmacists in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 is conducive to improving the level of rational use of TCM, by ensuring the effectiveness, and safety.
32281335,The outbreak caused by 2019 novel coronavirus(2019-nCoV) is still spreading, posing a great threat to the safety and health of general population.
32281335,However, there have not been any effective drugs for treatment, with symptomatic treatment and prevention prevailing.
32281335,The treatment plans of severe acute respiratory syndrome(SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome(MERS) are often used for reference in clinic.
32281335,The advantages of traditional Chinese medicine(TCM) in treating SARS and MERS are that it can intervene and block the progression of disease in early stage, significantly reduce symptoms, shorten the treatment duration of patients, reduce complications and side effects caused by hormone therapy.
32281335,The coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) belongs to the category of TCM epidemic diseases.
32281335,Chinese patent medicines and prescriptions in medical observation and clinical treatment were recommended in the &amp;quot;pneumonia diagnosis and treatment plan for new coronavirus infection&amp;quot;(trial version fifth) of the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
32281335,Qingfei Paidu Decotion was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China and National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine.
32281335,TCM shows good clinical efficacy and great potential in the treatment of COVID-19.
32281335,Previous studies of TCM have shown broad-spectrum antiviral activity, providing a variety of sources for the discovery of new antiviral drugs.
32281335,In this paper, we reviewed traditional Chinese medicines and its active ingredients in the hope of bringing novel inspirations to the drug screening and clinical treatment for COVID-19.
32281481,As a result of the 2019 coronavirus disease pandemic (COVID-19), there has been an urgent worldwide demand for treatments.
32281481,Due to factors such as history of prescription for other infectious diseases, availability, and relatively low cost, the use of chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has been tested <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> for the ability to inhibit the causative virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32281481,However, even though investigators noted the therapeutic potential of these drugs, it is important to consider the toxicological risks and necessary care for rational use of CQ and HCQ.
32281481,This study provides information on the main toxicological and epidemiological aspects to be considered for prophylaxis or treatment of COVID-19 using CQ but mainly HCQ, which is a less toxic derivative than CQ, and was shown to produce better results in inhibiting proliferation of SARS-CoV-2 based upon preliminary tests.
32281667,We have read with interest the review of Feng et al. &quot;Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): What we know?
32281667,&quot; 1 which report the clinical features, diagnosis and treatment of the novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32281667,This article is protected by copyright.

32281674,Coronavirus (CoV) is the single stranded sense RNA virus that has been known so far with the largest genomic capacity and plenty of natural hosts.
32281674,In the past dozens of years, SARS-CoV under the branch of the new evolutionary tree has threatens greatly global public health and the severe acute respiratory syndrome new coronavirus (COVID-19) reported in China could cause fatal pathological lesions.
32281674,Especially in areas with poor medical care, neglect of indirect transmission can cause more serious consequences.
32281674,First of all, with reference to SARS-CoV and other relevant studies, the possibility of virus residues on the surface of multiple media is discussed.
32281674,Further, it is found that the surface residue of this substance may be an important factor in iatrogenic infection.
32281674,This correspondence could point out the direction to study the pathomechanism of COVID-19 infecting human beings.
32281674,Mucosa exposure and inappropriate treatment of medical and non-medical articles used by the patients all could increase the risks of COVID-19 transmission.
32281695,The sudden outbreak of COVID-19 has led to more than seven thousand deaths.
32281695,Unfortunately, there are no specific drugs available to cure this disease.
32281695,Type 2 taste receptors (TAS2Rs) may play an important role in host defense mechanisms.
32281695,Based on the idea of host-directed therapy (HDT), we performed a negative co-expression analysis using big data of 60 000 Affymetrix expression arrays and 5000 TCGA data sets to determine the functions of TAS2R10, which can be activated by numerous bitter substances.
32281695,Excitingly, we found that the main functions of TAS2R10 involved controlling infectious diseases caused by bacteria, viruses, and parasites, suggesting that TAS2R10 is a key trigger of host defense pathways.
32281695,To quickly guide the clinical treatment of 2019-nCoV, we searched currently available drugs that are agonists of TAS2Rs.
32281695,We identified many cheap, available, and safe medicines, such as diphenidol, quinine, chloroquine, artemisinin, chlorpheniramine, yohimbine, and dextromethorphan, which may target the most common symptoms caused by 2019-nCoV.
32281695,We suggest that a cocktail-like recipe of existing bitter drugs may help doctors to fight this catastrophic disease and that the general public may drink or eat bitter substances, such as coffee, tea, or bitter vegetables, to reduce the risk of infection.
32281757,Covid-19 is a disease caused by a new coronavirus presenting a variability of flu-like symptoms including fever, cough, myalgia and fatigue; in severe cases, patients develop pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis and septic shock, that can result in their death.
32281757,This infection, which was declared a global epidemic by the World Health Organization, is particularly dangerous for dialysis patients, as they are frail and more vulnerable to infections due to the overlap of multiple pathologies.
32281757,In patients with full-blown symptoms, there is a renal impairment of various degrees in 100% of the subjects observed.
32281757,However, as Covid-19 is an emerging disease, more work is needed to improve prevention, diagnosis and treatment strategies.
32281757,It is essential to avoid nosocomial spread; in order to control and reduce the rate of infections it is necessary to strengthen the management of medical and nursing personnel through the early diagnosis, isolation and treatment of patients undergoing dialysis treatment.
32281757,We cover here a series of recommendations for the treatment of dialysis patients who are negative to the virus, and of those who are suspected or confirmed positive.
32282022,The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) presents an unprecedented challenge to identify effective drugs for prevention and treatment.
32282022,Given the rapid pace of scientific discovery and clinical data generated by the large number of people rapidly infected by SARS-CoV-2, clinicians need accurate evidence regarding effective medical treatments for this infection.
32282022,No proven effective therapies for this virus currently exist.
32282022,The rapidly expanding knowledge regarding SARS-CoV-2 virology provides a significant number of potential drug targets.
32282022,The most promising therapy is remdesivir.
32282022,Remdesivir has potent in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2, but it is not US Food and Drug Administration approved and currently is being tested in ongoing randomized trials.
32282022,Oseltamivir has not been shown to have efficacy, and corticosteroids are currently not recommended.
32282022,Current clinical evidence does not support stopping angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers in patients with COVID-19.
32282022,The COVID-19 pandemic represents the greatest global public health crisis of this generation and, potentially, since the pandemic influenza outbreak of 1918.
32282022,The speed and volume of clinical trials launched to investigate potential therapies for COVID-19 highlight both the need and capability to produce high-quality evidence even in the middle of a pandemic.
32282022,No therapies have been shown effective to date.
32282359,The current COVID-19 pandemic will place enormous pressure on healthcare systems around the world.
32282359,Large numbers of people are predicted to become critically ill with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and will require management in intensive care units (ICUs).
32282359,High levels of physical, cognitive and psychosocial impairments can be anticipated.
32282359,Rehabilitation providers will serve as an important link in the continuum of care, helping move patients on from acute sites to eventual discharge to the community.
32282359,Likely impairment patterns, considerations for healthcare practitioner resilience, and organization of services to meet demand are discussed.
32282359,Innovative approaches to care, such as virtual rehabilitation, are likely to become common in this environment.
32282372,The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted all aspects of academic medical center missions.
32282372,The number and rapidity of innovative responses to the crisis are extraordinary.
32282372,When the pandemic has subsided, the world of academic medicine will have changed.
32282372,The author of this Invited Commentary anticipates that at least some of these innovations will become part of academic medicine's everyday clinical and educational operations.
32282372,Here he considers the implications of exemplary innovations-virtual care, hospital at home, advances in diagnosis and therapy, virtual learning, and virtual clinical learning-for regulators, academic medical centers, faculty, and students.
32282502,A novel betacoronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread rapidly across the globe since December 2019.
32282502,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has a significantly higher mortality rate than seasonal influenza and has disproportionately affected older adults, especially those with cardiovascular disease and related risk factors.
32282502,Adverse cardiovascular sequalae, such has myocarditis, acute myocardial infarction, and heart failure, have been reported in patients with COVID-19.
32282502,No established treatment is currently available; however, several therapies, including remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, and interleukin (IL)-6 inhibitors, are being used off-label and evaluated in ongoing clinical trials.
32282502,Considering these therapies are not familiar to cardiovascular clinicians managing these patients, this review describes the pharmacology of these therapies in the context of their use in patients with cardiovascular-related conditions.
32282614,The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has unique implications for the anesthetic management of endovascular therapy for acute ischemic stroke.
32282614,The Society for Neuroscience in Anesthesiology and Critical Care appointed a task force to provide timely, consensus-based expert recommendations using available evidence for the safe and effective anesthetic management of endovascular therapy for acute ischemic stroke during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32282614,The goal of this consensus statement is to provide recommendations for anesthetic management considering: (1) optimal neurological outcomes for patients; (2) minimizing the risk for healthcare professionals, and (3) facilitating judicious use of resources while accounting for existing variability in care.
32282614,It provides a framework for selecting optimal anesthetic technique (general anesthesia or monitored anesthesia care) for a given patient and offers suggestions for best practices for anesthesia care during the pandemic.
32282614,Institutions and healthcare providers are encouraged to adapt these recommendations to best suit local needs, considering existing practice standards and resource availability to ensure safety of patients and providers.
32282863,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a kind of viral pneumonia with an unusual outbreak in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32282863,The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has been marked as the third introduction of a highly pathogenic coronavirus into the human population after the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in the twenty-first century.
32282863,In this minireview, we provide a brief introduction of the general features of SARS-CoV-2 and discuss current knowledge of molecular immune pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 on the base of the present understanding of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections, which may be helpful in offering novel insights and potential therapeutic targets for combating the SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32282974,The COVID- 19 pandemic is a critical test for the already overburdened and mostly underfunded public healthcare systems of Latin America.
32282974,In a region that suffers from severe inequalities, public healthcare systems are the only source of medical care for a large sector of the population who work in the informal economy or are unemployed.
32282974,State-run hospitals and clinics are already overstressed by continuous demand for treatment of vector-borne diseases and community-acquired infections as well as high rates of non-communicable diseases.
32282974,Ideological misconceptions and denial among Latin America's political leaders prevented timely preparations for the pandemic and added to chronic governance problems.
32282974,As ethical expertise in Latin America focuses on research ethics, few hospitals in the region have functioning clinical ethics committees or clinical ethics policy, forcing healthcare personnel to make excruciating treatment decisions in an environment dominated by material scarcity and public distrust.
32282974,This essay examines the emergence of COVID-19 in Latin America and the serious challenge that it poses for Latin America's public healthcare systems.
32282986,Over 1,000,000 cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been confirmed since the worldwide outbreak began.
32282986,Not enough data on infected solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients are available, especially data about the management of immunosuppressants.
32282986,We report two cases of COVID-19 in two transplant recipients, with different treatments and prognoses.
32282986,The first patient received liver transplantation due to hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma and was confirmed to have COVID-19 nine days later.
32282986,Following a treatment regimen consisting of discontinued immunosuppressant use and low-dose methylprednisolone-based therapy, the patient developed acute rejection but eventually recovered.
32282986,The other patient had undergone a renal transplant from a living related donor 17 years ago, and was admitted to the hospital because of persistent fever.
32282986,This patient was also diagnosed with COVID-19.
32282986,His treatment regimen consisted of reduced immunosuppressant use.
32282986,No signs of rejection were observed during the regimen.
32282986,In the end, the patient successfully recovered from COVID-19.
32282986,These effectively treated cases can provide a basis for immunosuppressant management of COVID-19-positive SOT recipients.
32282991,The role of systemic inflammation is proving crucial in determining unfavorable outcome in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.
32282991,Limited data are available regarding immunosuppression management in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.
32282991,We report a case of a 32-year-old KTR who developed SARS-CoV-2 infection and fully recovered in 15 days while maintaining standard immunosuppressive therapy.
32282993,We would like to thank the authors for their insightful thoughts on the consideration of anticoagulants and treatment for haemophilia A and B during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32282993,They highlight some important practical points which certainly should be adopted by the thrombosis and haemostasis community in the current situation of restricted mobility, which reduces the possibility for patients to access general practitioners and hospitals.
32283108,The rapid global emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has been the cause of significant health concern, highlighting the immediate need for antivirals.
32283108,Viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) play essential roles in viral RNA synthesis, and thus remains the target of choice for the prophylactic or curative treatment of several viral diseases, due to high sequence and structural conservation.
32283108,To date, the most promising broad-spectrum class of viral RdRp inhibitors are nucleoside analogues (NAs), with over 25 approved for the treatment of several medically important viral diseases.
32283108,However, Coronaviruses stand out as a particularly challenging case for NA drug design due to the presence of an exonuclease (ExoN) domain capable of excising incorporated NAs and thus providing resistance to many of these available antivirals.
32283108,Here we use the available structures of the SARS-CoV RdRp and ExoN proteins, as well as Lassa virus N exonuclease to derive models of catalytically competent SARS-CoV-2 enzymes.
32283108,We then map a promising NA candidate, GS-441524 (the active metabolite of Remdesivir) to the nucleoside active site of both proteins, identifying the residues important for nucleotide recognition, discrimination, and excision.
32283108,Interestingly, GS-441524 addresses both enzyme active sites in a manner consistent with significant incorporation, delayed chain termination, and altered excision due to the ribose 1'-CN group, which may account for the increased antiviral effect compared to other available analogues.
32283108,Additionally, we propose structural and function implications of two previously identified RdRp resistance mutations in relation to resistance against Remdesivir.
32283108,This study highlights the importance of considering the balance between incorporation and excision properties of NAs between the RdRp and ExoN.
32283143,Lopinavir/ritonavir and arbidol have been previously used to treat acute respiratory syndrome- coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) replication in clinical practice; nevertheless, their effectiveness remains controversial.
32283143,In this study, we evaluated the antiviral effects and safety of lopinavir/ritonavir and arbidol in patients with the 2019-nCoV disease (COVID-19).
32283143,Fifty patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were divided into two groups: including lopinavir/ritonavir group (34 cases) and arbidol group (16 cases).
32283143,Lopinavir/ritonavir group received 400mg/100mg of Lopinavir/ritonavir, twice a day for a week, while the arbidol group was given 0.2g arbidol, three times a day.
32283143,Data from these patients were retrospectively analyzed.
32283143,The cycle threshold values of open reading frame 1ab and nucleocapsid genes by RT-PCR assay were monitored during antiviral therapy.
32283143,None of the patients developed severe pneumonia or ARDS.
32283143,There was no difference in fever duration between the two groups (P=0.61).
32283143,On day 14 after the admission, no viral load was detected in arbidol group, but the viral load was found in 15(44.1%) patients treated with lopinavir/ritonavir.
32283143,Patients in the arbidol group had a shorter duration of positive RNA test compared to those in the lopinavir/ritonavir group (P&lt;0.01).
32283143,Moreover, no apparent side effects were found in both groups.
32283143,In conclusion, our data indicate that arbidol monotherapy may be superior to lopinavir/ritonavir in treating COVID-19.
32283144,An outbreak of novel coronavirus in 2019 threatens the health of people, and there is no proven pharmacological treatment.
32283144,Although corticosteroids were widely used during outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome, their efficacy remains highly controversial.
32283144,We aimed to further evaluate the influence of corticosteroids on patients with coronavirus infection.
32283144,We conducted a comprehensive literature search from January 1, 2002 to March 15, 2020 in the PubMed, Embase, Cochrane library, and China national knowledge infrastructure (CNKI).
32283144,All statistical analyses in this study were performed on stata14.0.
32283144,A total of 5270 patients from 15 studies were included in this meta-analysis.
32283144,The result indicated that critical patients were more likely to require corticosteroids therapy (risk ratio [RR]=1.56, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.28-1.90, P&lt;0.001).
32283144,However, corticosteroid treatment was associated with higher mortality (RR=2.11, 95%CI=1.13-3.94, P=0.019), longer length of stay (weighted mean difference [WMD]=6.31, 95%CI=5.26-7.37, P&lt;0.001), a higher rate of bacterial infection (RR=2.08, 95%CI=1.54-2.81, P&lt;0.001), and hypokalemia (RR=2.21, 95%CI=1.07-4.55, P=0.032) but not hyperglycemia (RR=1.37, 95%CI=0.68-2.76, P=0.376) or hypocalcemia (RR=1.35, 95%CI=0.77-2.37, P=0.302).
32283144,Patients with severe conditions are more likely to require corticosteroids.
32283144,Corticosteroid use is associated with increased mortality in patients with coronavirus pneumonia.
32283152,Cytokine storm is an excessive immune response to external stimuli.
32283152,The pathogenesis of the cytokine storm is complex.
32283152,The disease progresses rapidly, and the mortality is high.
32283152,Certain evidence shows that, during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic, the severe deterioration of some patients has been closely related to the cytokine storm in their bodies.
32283152,This article reviews the occurrence mechanism and treatment strategies of the COVID-19 virus-induced inflammatory storm in attempt to provide valuable medication guidance for clinical treatment.
32283185,The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant barriers to timely donor evaluation, cell collection and graft transport for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HCT).
32283185,To ensure availability of donor cells on the scheduled date of infusion, many sites now collect cryopreserve grafts before the start of pretransplant conditioning.
32283185,Post-transplant cyclophosphamide (ptCY), is an increasingly used approach for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis but the impact of graft cryopreservation on the outcomes of allo-HCT using ptCY is not known.
32283185,Using the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) database, we compared the outcomes of HCT using cryopreserved versus fresh grafts in patients undergoing HCT for hematologic malignancy with ptCY.
32283185,We analyzed 274 patients with hematologic malignancy undergoing allo-HCT from 2013-2018 with cryopreserved grafts and ptCY.
32283185,Eighteen received bone marrow and 256, peripheral blood grafts.
32283185,These were matched for age, graft type, disease risk index (DRI) and propensity score to 1,080 patients that underwent allo-HCT with a fresh graft.
32283185,The propensity score, which is an assessment of the likelihood of receiving a fresh versus cryopreserved graft, was calculated logistic regression to account for the following: disease histology, Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS), HCT-comorbidity index, conditioning regimen intensity, donor type and recipient race.
32283185,The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS).
32283185,Secondary endpoints included acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease GVHD, non-relapse mortality (NRM), relapse/progression and disease-free survival (DFS).
32283185,Because of multiple comparisons, only p-values &lt;0.01 were considered statistically significant.
32283185,The two cohorts (cryopreserved versus fresh) were similar in patient age, KPS, diagnosis, DRI, HCT-comorbidity index, donor/graft source, and conditioning intensity.
32283185,One-year probabilities of OS were 71.1% (95% confidence interval, 68.3-73.8%) with fresh grafts and 70.3% (64.6-75.7%) with cryopreserved grafts (p=0.81).
32283185,Corresponding probabilities of OS survival at two years were 60.6% (57.3-63.8%) and 58.7% (51.9-65.4%) (p=0.62).
32283185,In matched pair regression analysis, graft cryopreservation was not associated with a significantly higher risk of mortality (Hazard Ratio for cryopreserved versus fresh [HR] =1.05, 95% confidence interval, 0.86-1.29, p=0.60).
32283185,Similarly, rates neutrophil recovery (HR=0.91, 0.80-1.02, p=0.12), platelet recovery (HR=0.88, 0.78-1.00, p=0.05), grade 3-4 acute GVHD (HR=0.78, 0.50-1.22, p=0.27), NRM (HR=1.16, 0.86-1.55, p=0.32) and relapse/progression (HR=1.21, 0.97-1.50, p=0.09) were similar with cryopreserved versus fresh grafts.
32283185,There were somewhat lower rates chronic GVHD (HR=0.78, 0.61-0.99, p=0.04) and DFS (HR for treatment failure=1.19, 95%CI=1.01-1.29, p=0.04) with graft cryopreservation that were of marginal statistical significance after adjusting for multiple comparisons.
32283185,Graft cryopreservation does not significantly delay hematopoietic recovery, increase acute GVHD risk or NRM, or decrease overall survival after all-HCT using ptCY.
32283217,This report highlights details on a pregnant case of COVID-19 who unfortunately did not survive.
32283217,This 27-year-old woman at her 30 and 3/7 weeks' gestation was referred to our center with fever, myalgia, and cough.
32283217,The laboratory investigations showed leukopenia and lymphopenia as well as increased creatinine and CRP levels.
32283217,The first chest X-ray (faint bilateral patchy opacities) and CT scan (some faint subpleural ground-glass opacities associated with pleural thickening) were not typical for initial COVID-19 pulmonary infection, however, the treatment for COVID-19 was started.
32283217,Due to respiratory distress, she was intubated and put under mechanical ventilation.
32283217,After a while, the fetus was born with Apgar score of 0 and did not react to the neonatal cardiopulmonary resuscitation protocol.
32283217,Finally, due to deterioration in the clinical and imaging findings, the patient was expired as a result of multi-organ failure.
32283217,Following the death, autopsy was performed and the histopathologic evaluations of the lungs showed evidence of viral pneumonia (viral cytopathic effect and a mild increase in alveolar wall thickness) and ARDS (hyaline membrane).
32283217,Also, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lungs.
32283217,To our knowledge, this is the first report of maternal death with confirmed COVID-19 infection.
32283219,As COVID-19 cases increase throughout the country and healthcare systems grapple with the need to decrease provider exposure and minimize personal protective equipment (PPE) use while maintaining high quality patient care, our specialty is called upon to consider new methods of delivering inpatient palliative care.
32283219,Telepalliative medicine has been used to great effect in outpatient and home-based palliative care, but has had fewer applications in the inpatient setting.
32283219,As we plan for decreased provider availability due to quarantine and redeployment and seek to reach increasingly isolated hospitalized patients in the face of COVID-19, the need for telepalliative medicine in the inpatient setting is now clear.
32283219,We describe our rapid and ongoing implementation of telepalliative medicine consultation for our inpatient palliative care teams and discuss lessons learned and recommendations for programs considering similar care models.
32283324,The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2 is a threat to the health and well-being of millions of lifes across the globe.
32283324,A significant proportion of adult patients require hospitalisation and may develop severe life-threatening complications.
32283324,Children, on the other hand, can carry and transmit the virus, but usually do not develop severe disease.
32283324,Mortality in the paediatric age-group is relatively low.
32283324,Differences in virus containment and clearance, as well as reduced inflammation-related tissue and organ damage may be caused by age-specific environmental and host factors.
32283324,Since severe complications in adults are frequently caused by uncontrolled immune responses and a resulting &quot;cytokine storm&quot; that may be controlled by targeted blockade of cytokines, previously established treatment with immunosuppressive treatments may indeed protect children from complications.
32283325,Some patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection have abnormal liver function.
32283325,We aimed to clarify the features of COVID-19-related liver damage to provide references for clinical treatment.
32283325,We performed a retrospective, single-center study of 148 consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 (73 female, 75 male; mean age, 50 years) at the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center from January 20 through January 31, 2020.
32283325,Patient outcomes were followed until February 19, 2020.
32283325,Patients were analyzed for clinical features, laboratory parameters (including liver function tests), medications, and length of hospital stay.
32283325,Abnormal liver function was defined as increased levels of alanine and aspartate aminotransferase, gamma glutamyltransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin.
32283325,Fifty-five patients (37.2%) had abnormal liver function at hospital admission; 14.5% of these patients had high fever (14.5%), compared with 4.3% of patients with normal liver function (P=.027).
32283325,Patients with abnormal liver function were more likely to be male, and had higher levels of procalcitonin and C-reactive protein.
32283325,There was no statistical difference between groups in medications taken before hospitalization; a significantly higher proportion of patients with abnormal liver function (57.8%) had received lopinavir/ritonavir after admission compared to patients with normal liver function (31.3%).
32283325,Patients with abnormal liver function had longer mean hospital stays (15.09±4.79 days) than patients with normal liver function (12.76±4.14 days) (P=.021).
32283325,More than one third of patients admitted to the hospital with SARS-CoV-2 infection have abnormal liver function, and this is associated with longer hospital stay.
32283325,A significantly higher proportion of patients with abnormal liver function had received lopinavir/ritonavir after admission; these drugs should be given with caution.
32283815,From the end of 2019, the world population has been faced the spread of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 responsible for COVID-19 infection.
32283815,In approximately 14% of the patients affected by the novel coronavirus, the infection progresses with the development of pneumonia that requires mechanical ventilation.
32283815,At the moment, there is no specific antiviral treatment recommended for the COVID-19 pandemic and the therapeutic strategies to deal with the infection are only supportive.
32283815,In our opinion, mesenchymal stem cell secretome could offer a new therapeutic approach in treating COVID-19 pneumonia, due to the broad pharmacological effects it shows, including anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, regenerative, pro-angiogenic and anti-fibrotic properties.
32284326,Effective treatments for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are urgently needed to control this current pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32284326,Replication of SARS-CoV-2 depends on the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which is the likely target of the investigational nucleotide analogue remdesivir (RDV).
32284326,RDV shows broad-spectrum antiviral activity against RNA viruses, and previous studies with RdRps from Ebola virus (EBOV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have revealed that delayed chain-termination is RDV's plausible mechanism of action.
32284326,Here, we expressed and purified active SARS-CoV-2 RdRp composed of the non-structural proteins nsp8 and nsp12.
32284326,Enzyme kinetics indicated that this RdRp efficiently incorporates the active triphosphate form of RDV (RDV-TP) into RNA.
32284326,Incorporation of RDV-TP at position i caused termination of RNA synthesis at position i+3.
32284326,We obtained almost identical results with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 RdRps.
32284326,A unique property of RDV-TP is its high selectivity over incorporation of its natural nucleotide counterpart ATP.
32284326,In this regard, the triphosphate forms of 2'-C-methylated compounds, including sofosbuvir, approved for the management of hepatitis C virus infection, and the broad-acting antivirals favipiravir and ribavirin, exhibited significant deficits.
32284326,Furthermore, we provide evidence for the target specificity of RDV, as RDV-TP was less efficiently incorporated by the distantly related Lassa virus RdRp, and termination of RNA synthesis was not observed.
32284326,These results collectively provide a unifying, refined mechanism of RDV-mediated RNA synthesis inhibition in coronaviruses and define this nucleotide analogue as a direct-acting antiviral (DAA).
32284379,Bunyaviruses are significant human pathogens, causing diseases ranging from hemorrhagic fevers to encephalitis.
32284379,Among these viruses, La Crosse virus (LACV), a member of the California serogroup, circulates in the eastern and midwestern United States.
32284379,While LACV infection is often asymptomatic, dozens of cases of encephalitis are reported yearly.
32284379,Unfortunately, no antivirals have been approved to treat LACV infection.
32284379,Here, we developed a method to rapidly test potential antivirals against LACV infection.
32284379,From this screen, we identified several potential antiviral molecules, including known antivirals.
32284379,Additionally, we identified many novel antivirals that exhibited antiviral activity without affecting cellular viability.
32284379,Valinomycin, a potassium ionophore, was among our top targets.
32284379,We found that valinomycin exhibited potent anti-LACV activity in multiple cell types in a dose-dependent manner.
32284379,Valinomycin did not affect particle stability or infectivity, suggesting that it may preclude virus replication by altering cellular potassium ions, a known determinant of LACV entry.
32284379,We extended these results to other ionophores and found that the antiviral activity of valinomycin extended to other viral families including bunyaviruses (Rift Valley fever virus, Keystone virus), enteroviruses (Coxsackievirus, rhinovirus), flavirivuses (Zika), and coronaviruses (HCoV-229E and MERS-CoV).
32284379,In all viral infections, we observed significant reductions in virus titer in valinomycin-treated cells.
32284379,In sum, we demonstrate the importance of potassium ions to virus infection, suggesting a potential therapeutic target to disrupt virus replication.<b>Importance</b> No antivirals are approved for the treatment of bunyavirus infection.
32284379,The ability to rapidly screen compounds and identify novel antivirals is one means to accelerate drug discovery for viruses with no approved treatments.
32284379,We used this approach to screen hundreds of compounds against La Crosse virus, an emerging bunyavirus that causes significant disease, including encephalitis.
32284379,We identified several known and previously unidentified antivirals.
32284379,We focused on a potassium ionophore, valinomycin, due to its promising <i>in vitro</i> antiviral activity.
32284379,We demonstrate that valinomycin, as well as a selection of other ionophores, exhibits activity against La Crosse virus as well as several other distantly related bunyaviruses.
32284379,We finally observe that valinomycin has activity against a wide array of human viral pathogens, suggesting that disrupting potassium ion homeostasis with valinomycin may be a potent host pathway to target to quell virus infection.
32284951,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has spread across the globe resulting in a pandemic.
32284951,At the time of this review, COVID-19 has been diagnosed in more than 200 000 patients and associated with over 8000 deaths (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, World Health Organization).
32284951,On behalf of the Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists, we herein summarize the current evidence as of March 18, 2020 to provide guidance on potential COVID-19 treatment options.
32284951,It is important to caution readers that new data emerges daily regarding clinical characteristics, treatment options, and outcomes for COVID-19.
32284951,Optimized supportive care remains the mainstay of therapy, and the clinical efficacy for the subsequent agents is still under investigation.
32284951,Antimicrobial stewardship programs, including infectious diseases pharmacists and physicians, are at the forefront of COVID-19 emergency preparedness.
32284951,We encourage all readers to continue to assess clinical data as it emerges and share their experience within our community in a well-controlled, adequately powered fashion.
32285293,Since December 2019, the infection of the new coronavirus (COVID-19) caused an outbreak of new coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China, and caused great public concern.
32285293,Both COVID-19 and SARS-CoV belong to the coronavirus family and both invade target cells through ACE2.
32285293,An in-depth understanding of ACE2 and a series of physiological and physiological changes caused by the virus invading the human body may help to discover and explain the corresponding clinical phenomena and then deal with them timely.
32285293,In addition, ACE2 is a potential therapeutic target.
32285293,This article will summarize the role of ACE2 in multiple organ damage caused by COVID-19 and SARS-CoV, targeted blocking drugs against ACE2, and drugs that inhibit inflammation in order to provide the basis for subsequent related research, diagnosis and treatment, and drug development.
32285338,Among surgeons worldwide, a concern with the use of minimally invasive techniques has been raised due to a proposed risk of viral transmission of the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) with the creation of pneumoperitoneum.
32285338,Due to this proposed concern, we sought to collect the available data and evaluate the use of laparoscopy and the risk of COVID-19 transmission.
32285338,A literature review of viral transmission in surgery and of the available literature regarding the transmission of the COVID-19 virus was performed.
32285338,We additionally reviewed surgical society guidelines and recommendations regarding surgery during this pandemic.
32285338,Few studies have been performed on viral transmission during surgery, but to date there is no study that demonstrates or can suggest the ability for a virus to be transmitted during surgical treatment whether open or laparoscopic.
32285338,There is no societal consensus on limiting or restricting laparoscopic or robotic surgery; however, there is expert consensus on the modification of standard practices to minimize any risk of transmission.
32285338,Despite very little evidence to support viral transmission through laparoscopic or open approaches, we recommend making modifications to surgical practice such as the use of smoke evacuation and minimizing energy device use among other measures to minimize operative staff exposure to aerosolized particles.
32285555,The COVID-19 pandemic is causing untold disruption across the globe and all countries irrespective of the strength and resilience of their health systems are feeling the burden.
32285555,Intensive care units are facing a surge of patients requiring invasive ventilation.It is likely that requests for a tracheostomy in COVID-19 ventilated patients will soon come our way.
32285555,It is difficult to predict the burden, but it would be remiss not to be prepared.
32285930,Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is a promising candidate for Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19) treatment.
32285930,The optimal dosing of HCQ is unknown.
32285930,Our goal was to integrate historic and emerging pharmacological and toxicity data to understand safe and efficacious HCQ dosing strategies for COVID-19 treatment.
32285930,The data sources included were 1) longitudinal clinical, pharmacokinetic, and virologic data from patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection who received HCQ with or without azithromycin (n=116), 2) in vitro viral replication data and SARS-CoV-2 viral load inhibition by HCQ, 3) a population pharmacokinetic model of HCQ and 4) a model relating chloroquine pharmacokinetics to QTc prolongation.
32285930,A mechanistic PK/virologic/QTc model for HCQ was developed and externally validated to predict SARS-CoV-2 rate of viral decline and QTc prolongation.
32285930,SARS-CoV-2 viral decline was associated with HCQ pharmacokinetics (p&lt;0.001).
32285930,The extrapolated patient EC<sub>50</sub> was 4.7 µM, comparable to the reported in vitro EC<sub>50</sub> 's.
32285930,HCQ doses &gt; 400 mg BID for ≥5 days were predicted to rapidly decrease viral loads, reduce the proportion of patients with detectable SARS-CoV-2 infection, and shorten treatment courses, compared to lower dose (≤400 mg daily) regimens.
32285930,However, HCQ doses &gt;600 mg BID were also predicted to prolong QTc intervals.
32285930,This prolongation may have clinical implications warranting further safety assessment.
32285930,Due to COVID-19's variable natural history, lower dose HCQ regimens may be indistinguishable from controls.
32285930,Evaluation of higher HCQ doses is needed to ensure adequate safety and efficacy.
32285949,In December 2019, an outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, China.
32285949,Since then, this disease has infected more than 900,000 individuals worldwide.
32285949,Here we report a case of non-severe COVID-19 pneumonia who was living with HIV.
32285949,Chest computed tomography (CT) showed different abnormalities from those of conventional COVID-19, and the faster absorption of pulmonary lesions also highlights the importance of antiretroviral therapy in this patient.
32285949,This report provides reference for the diagnosis and treatment of HIV-infected patients with COVID-19.

32286679,Coronaviruses cause disease in animals and people around the world.
32286679,Human coronaviruses (HCoV) are mainly known to cause infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract but the symptoms may also involve the nervous and digestive systems.
32286679,Since the beginning of December 2019, there has been an epidemic of SARS-CoV-2, which was originally referred to as 2019-nCoV.
32286679,The most common symptoms are fever and cough, fatigue, sputum production, dyspnea, myalgia, arthralgia or sore throat, headache, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea (30%).
32286679,The best prevention is to avoid exposure.
32286679,In addition, contact persons should be subjected to mandatory quarantine.
32286679,COVID-19 patients should be treated in specialist centers.
32286679,A significant number of patients with pneumonia require passive oxygen therapy.
32286679,Non-invasive ventilation and high-flow nasal oxygen therapy can be applied in mild and moderate non-hypercapnia cases.
32286679,A lung-saving ventilation strategy must be implemented in acute respiratory distress syndrome and mechanically ventilated patients.
32286679,Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is a highly specialized method, available only in selected centers and not applicable to a significant number of cases.
32286679,Specific pharmacological treatment for COVID-19 is not currently available.
32286679,Modern medicine is gearing up to fight the new coronavirus pandemic.
32286679,The key is a holistic approach to the patient including, primarily, the use of personal protective equipment to reduce the risk of further virus transmission, as well as patient management, which consists in both quarantine and, in the absence of specific pharmacological therapy, symptomatic treatment.
32286766,The novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, and its infection, COVID-19, has quickly become a worldwide threat to health, travel, and commerce.
32286766,It is essential for emergency clinicians to learn as much as possible about this pandemic to manage the unprecedented burdens on healthcare providers and hospital systems.
32286766,This review analyzes information from worldwide research and experience on the epidemiology, prevention, and treatment of COVID-19, and offers links to the most reliable and trustworthy resources to help equip healthcare professionals in managing this public health challenge.
32286766,As the pandemic sweeps the United States, lessons learned from early centers of infection, notably New York and Northern Italy, can help localities to prepare.
32286790,Peptide inhibitors against the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, currently causing a worldwide pandemic, are designed and simulated.
32286790,The inhibitors are mostly formed by two sequential self-supporting α-helices (bundle) extracted from the protease domain (PD) of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which bind to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domains.
32286790,Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the α-helical peptides maintain their secondary structure and provide a highly specific and stable binding (blocking) to SARS-CoV-2.
32286790,To provide a multivalent binding to the SARS-CoV-2 receptors, many such peptides could be attached to the surfaces of nanoparticle carriers.
32286790,The proposed peptide inhibitors could provide simple and efficient therapeutics against the COVID-19 disease.
32286947,The outbreak of COVID-19 due to SARS-CoV-2 originally emerged in Wuhan in December, 2019.
32286947,As of March 22, 2020, the disease had spread to 186 countries, with at least 305,275 confirmed cases.
32286947,Although there has been a decline in the spread of the disease in China, the prevalence of COVID-19 around the world remains serious despite containment efforts undertaken by national authorities and the international community.
32286947,In this article, we systematically review the brief history of COVID-19 and its epidemic and clinical characteristics, highlighting the strategies used to control and prevent the disease in China, which may help other countries respond to the outbreak.
32286947,This pandemic emphasizes the need to be constantly alert to shifts in both the global dynamics and the contexts of individual countries, making sure that all are aware of which approaches are successful for the prevention, containment and treatment of new diseases, and being flexible enough to adapt the responses accordingly.
32287140,Since the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in December 2019, various digestive symptoms have been frequently reported in patients infected with the virus.
32287140,In this study, we aimed to further investigate the prevalence and outcomes of COVID-19 patients with digestive symptoms.
32287140,In this descriptive, cross-sectional, multicenter study, we enrolled confirmed patients with COVID-19 who presented to 3 hospitals from January 18, 2020, to February 28, 2020.
32287140,All patients were confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction and were analyzed for clinical characteristics, laboratory data, and treatment.
32287140,Data were followed up until March 18, 2020.
32287140,In the present study, 204 patients with COVID-19 and full laboratory, imaging, and historical data were analyzed.
32287140,The average age was 52.9 years (SD ± 16), including 107 men and 97 women.
32287140,Although most patients presented to the hospital with fever or respiratory symptoms, we found that 103 patients (50.5%) reported a digestive symptom, including lack of appetite (81 [78.6%] cases), diarrhea (35 [34%] cases), vomiting (4 [3.9%] cases), and abdominal pain (2 [1.9%] cases).
32287140,If lack of appetite is excluded from the analysis (because it is less specific for the gastrointestinal tract), there were 38 total cases (18.6%) where patients presented with a gastrointestinal-specific symptom, including diarrhea, vomiting, or abdominal pain.
32287140,Patients with digestive symptoms had a significantly longer time from onset to admission than patients without digestive symptoms (9.0 days vs 7.3 days).
32287140,In 6 cases, there were digestive symptoms, but no respiratory symptoms.
32287140,As the severity of the disease increased, digestive symptoms became more pronounced.
32287140,Patients with digestive symptoms had higher mean liver enzyme levels, lower monocyte count, longer prothrombin time, and received more antimicrobial treatment than those without digestive symptoms.
32287140,We found that digestive symptoms are common in patients with COVID-19.
32287140,Moreover, these patients have a longer time from onset to admission, evidence of longer coagulation, and higher liver enzyme levels.
32287140,Clinicians should recognize that digestive symptoms, such as diarrhea, are commonly among the presenting features of COVID-19 and that the index of suspicion may need to be raised earlier in at-risk patients presenting with digestive symptoms.
32287140,However, further large sample studies are needed to confirm these findings.
32287142,The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (COVID-19) pandemic has challenged medical systems and clinicians globally to unforeseen levels.
32287142,COVID-19's rapid spread has forced clinicians to care for patients with a highly contagious disease without evidence-based guidelines.
32287142,Using a virtual modified nominal group technique, the Pediatric Difficult Intubation Collaborative (PeDI-C), which currently includes 35 hospitals from six countries, generated consensus guidelines on airway management in pediatric anesthesia based on expert opinion and early data about the disease.
32287142,The PeDI-C identified overarching goals during care, including minimizing aerosolized respiratory secretions, minimizing the number of clinicians in contact with a patient, and recognizing that undiagnosed asymptomatic patients may shed the virus and infect healthcare workers.
32287142,Recommendations include administering anxiolytic medications, intravenous anesthetic inductions, tracheal intubation using video laryngoscopes and cuffed tracheal tubes, use of in-line suction catheters, and modifying workflow to recover patients from anesthesia in the operating room.
32287142,Importantly, the PeDI-C recommends that anesthesiologists consider using appropriate personal protective equipment when performing aerosol-generating medical procedures in asymptomatic children, in addition to known or suspected children with COVID-19.
32287142,Airway procedures should be done in negative pressure rooms when available.
32287142,Adequate time should be allowed for operating room cleaning and air filtration between surgical cases.
32287142,Research using rigorous study designs is urgently needed to inform safe practices during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32287142,Until further information is available, the PeDI-C advises that clinicians consider these guidelines to enhance the safety of health care workers during airway management when performing aerosol-generating medical procedures.
32287142,These guidelines have been endorsed by the Society for Pediatric Anesthesia and the Canadian Pediatric Anesthesia Society.
32288414,During the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), epidemiological data is essential for controlling the source of infection, cutting off the route of transmission, and protecting vulnerable populations.
32288414,Following Law of the People's Republic of China on Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases and other related regulations, medical institutions have been authorized to collect the detailed information of patients, while it is still a formidable task in megacities because of the significant patient mobility and the existing information sharing barrier.
32288414,As a smart city which strengthens precise epidemic prevention and control, Shanghai has established a multi-department platform named &quot;one-net management&quot; on dynamic information monitoring.
32288414,By sharing epidemiological data with medical institutions under a safe environment, we believe that the ability to prevent and control epidemics among medical institutions will be effectively and comprehensively improved.
32289016,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is pandemic and has caused illness to many people worldwide.
32289016,This review aimed to summarize and analyze the herbal formulae provided by the guidelines for their pattern identifications (PIs) and compositions of herbs to treat patients with COVID-19.
32289016,We searched 7 data sources for eligible traditional medicine guidelines up to March 6, 2020 and found a total of 28 traditional medicine guidelines that provide treatment measures for COVID-19.
32289016,Of the 28 guidelines, there were 26 government-issued Chinese guidelines and 2 Korean guidelines.
32289016,After standardizing the terminology of the PIs and herbal formulae, there were 8 PIs and 23 herbal formulae for the mild stage, 11 PIs and 31 herbal formulae for the moderate stage, 8 PIs and 21 herbal formulae for the severe stage, and 6 PIs and 23 herbal formulae for the recovery stage in the Chinese guidelines.
32289016,In the Korean guidelines, there were 4 PIs and 15 herbal formulae for the mild stage, 3 PIs and 3 herbal formulae for the severe stage, and 2 PIs and 2 herbal formulae for the recovery stage.
32289016,In the frequency analysis of herbs, Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma was found to be the herb with the highest frequency of usage in the Chinese guidelines.
32289016,This review can be used as guidance for the traditional medicine treatment of COVID-19.
32289016,Clinical evidence is needed in the future to evaluate the efficacy of traditional medicine.
32289376,Washington State was the first U.S. state to have a patient test positive for COVID-19.
32289376,Prior to this, our children's hospital proactively implemented an incident command structure which allowed for collaborative creation of safety measures, policies and procedures for both patients, families, staff and providers.
32289376,Although the treatment and protective standards are continuously evolving, this commentary shares our thoughts on how an institution, specifically surgical services may develop collaborative process improvement to accommodate for rapid and ongoing change.
32289376,Specific changes outlined include [1] early establishment of incident command [2] personal protective equipment conservation, [3] workforce safety, [4] surgical and ambulatory patient triage, and [5] optimization of trainee education.
32289376,Please note that the contents of this manuscript are shared in the interest of providing collaborative information and are under continuous development as our regional situation changes.
32289376,We recognize the limitations of this commentary and do not suggest that our approaches represent validated best practices.
32289472,COVID-19 has now been declared a pandemic.
32289472,To date, COVID-19 has affected over 944,181 people worldwide, resulting in over 47,312 reported deaths.
32289472,Numerous preventative strategies and non-pharmaceutical interventions have been employed to mitigate the spread of disease including careful infection control, the isolation of patients, and social distancing.
32289472,Management is predominantly focused on the provision of supportive care, with oxygen therapy representing the major treatment intervention.
32289472,Medical therapy involving corticosteroids and antivirals have also been encouraged as part of critical management schemes.
32289472,However, there is at present no specific antiviral recommended for the treatment of COVID-19, and no vaccine is currently available.
32289472,Despite the strategic implementation of these measures, the number of new reported cases continues to rise at a profoundly alarming rate.
32289472,As new findings emerge, there is an urgent need for up-to-date management guidelines.
32289472,In response to this call, we review what is currently known regarding the management of COVID-19, and offer an evidence-based review of current practice.
32289548,We need an effective treatment to cure COVID-19 patients and to decrease virus carriage duration.
32289548,We conducted an uncontrolled non-comparative observational study in a cohort of 80 relatively mildly infected inpatients treated with a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin over a period of at least three days, with three main measurements: clinical outcome, contagiousness as assessed by PCR and culture, and length of stay in infectious disease unit (IDU).
32289548,All patients improved clinically except one 86 year-old patient who died, and one 74 year-old patient still in intensive care.
32289548,A rapid fall of nasopharyngeal viral load was noted, with 83% negative at Day7, and 93% at Day8.
32289548,Virus cultures from patient respiratory samples were negative in 97.5% of patients at Day5.
32289548,Consequently patients were able to be rapidly discharged from IDU with a mean length of stay of five days.
32289548,We believe there is urgency to evaluate the effectiveness of this potentially-life saving therapeutic strategy at a larger scale, both to treat and cure patients at an early stage before irreversible severe respiratory complications take hold and to decrease duration of carriage and avoid the spread of the disease.
32289548,Furthermore, the cost of treatment is negligible.
32289565,To investigate the epidemiological and clinical features of patients with COVID-19 in Anhui province of China.
32289565,In this descriptive study, we obtained epidemiological, demographic, manifestations, laboratory data and radiological findings of patients confirmed by real-time RT-PCR in the NO.2 People's Hospital of Fuyang City from Jan 20 to Feb 9, 2020.
32289565,Clinical outcomes were followed up to Feb 18, 2020.
32289565,Of 125 patients infected SARS-CoV-2, the mean age was 38.76 years (SD, 13.799) and 71(56.8%) were male.
32289565,Common symptoms include fever [116 (92.8%)], cough [102(81.6%)], and shortness of breath [57(45.6%)].
32289565,Lymphocytopenia developed in 48(38.4%) patients.
32289565,100(80.0%) patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 26(20.8%) patients showed multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity.
32289565,All patients were given antiviral therapy.
32289565,19(15.2%) patients were transferred to the intensive care unit.
32289565,By February 18, 47(37.6%) patients were discharged and none of patients died.
32289565,Among the discharged patients, the median time of length of stay was 14.8 days (SD 4.16).
32289565,In this single-center, retrospective, descriptive study, fever is the most common symptom.
32289565,Old age, chronic underlying diseases and smoking history may be risk factors to worse condition.
32289565,Certain laboratory inspection may contribute to the judgment of the severity of illness.
32289791,Using Richardson and Davidson's model and the sciences of pharmacokinetics and clinical pharmacopsychology, this article reviewed the: (1) poor life expectancy associated with treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS), which may be improved in patients who adhere to clozapine; (2) findings that clozapine is the best treatment for TRS (according to efficacy, effectiveness and well-being); and (3) potential for clozapine to cause vulnerabilities, including potentially lethal adverse drug reactions such as agranulocytosis, pneumonia, and myocarditis.
32289791,Rational use requires: (1) modification of the clozapine package insert worldwide to include lower doses for Asians and to avoid the lethality associated with pneumonia, (2) the use of clozapine levels for personalizing dosing, and (3) the use of slow and personalized titration.
32289791,This may make clozapine as safe as possible and contribute to increased life expectancy and well-being.
32289791,In the absence of data on COVID-19 in clozapine patients, clozapine possibly impairs immunological mechanisms and may increase pneumonia risk in infected patients.
32289791,Psychiatrists should call their clozapine patients and families and explain to them that if the patient develops fever or flu-like symptoms, the psychiatrist should be called and should consider halving the clozapine dose.
32289791,If the patient is hospitalized with pneumonia, the treating physician needs to assess for symptoms of clozapine intoxication since halving the dose may not be enough for all patients; consider decreasing it to one-third or even stopping it.
32289791,Once the signs of inflammation and fever have disappeared, the clozapine dose can be slowly increased to the prior dosage level.
32290293,The sudden outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV, later named SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China, which rapidly grew into a global pandemic, marked the third introduction of a virulent coronavirus into the human society, affecting not only the healthcare system, but also the global economy.
32290293,Although our understanding of coronaviruses has undergone a huge leap after two precedents, the effective approaches to treatment and epidemiological control are still lacking.
32290293,In this article, we present a succinct overview of the epidemiology, clinical features, and molecular characteristics of SARS-CoV-2.
32290293,We summarize the current epidemiological and clinical data from the initial Wuhan studies, and emphasize several features of SARS-CoV-2, which differentiate it from SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), such as high variability of disease presentation.
32290293,We systematize the current clinical trials that have been rapidly initiated after the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic.
32290293,Whereas the trials on SARS-CoV-2 genome-based specific vaccines and therapeutic antibodies are currently being tested, this solution is more long-term, as they require thorough testing of their safety.
32290293,On the other hand, the repurposing of the existing therapeutic agents previously designed for other virus infections and pathologies happens to be the only practical approach as a rapid response measure to the emergent pandemic, as most of these agents have already been tested for their safety.
32290293,These agents can be divided into two broad categories, those that can directly target the virus replication cycle, and those based on immunotherapy approaches either aimed to boost innate antiviral immune responses or alleviate damage induced by dysregulated inflammatory responses.
32290293,The initial clinical studies revealed the promising therapeutic potential of several of such drugs, including <i>favipiravir</i>, a broad-spectrum antiviral drug that interferes with the viral replication, and <i>hydroxychloroquine</i>, the repurposed antimalarial drug that interferes with the virus endosomal entry pathway.
32290293,We speculate that the current pandemic emergency will be a trigger for more systematic drug repurposing design approaches based on big data analysis.
32290348,The outbreak of COVID-19 is leading to a tremendous search for curative treatments.
32290348,The urgency of the situation favors a repurposing of active drugs but not only antivirals.
32290348,This short communication focuses on four treatments recommended by WHO and included in the first clinical trial of the European Discovery project.
32290643,To summarize the administration model of a COVID-19 designated hospital transformed from a community hospital to improve the emergency capacity of community hospitals and the efficiency of diagnosis and treatment of medical staff in the COVID-19 pandemic.
32290643,Analyze the surrounding environment, ward layout, area management, treatment process, medical staff and patient management of the designated community hospital.
32290643,From February 5, 2020, to February 18, 2020, the designated community hospital has received 198 COVID-19 mild and general patients (including 41 in the hospital at the beginning of the period).
32290643,Among them, 39 were transferred to module hospitals, 131 were discharged, and 28 were in the hospital at the end of the period, and none of them became severe.
32290643,There were 41 medical staff, and none of them had COVID-19 infection.
32290643,We have achieved excellent results in the prevention and control stratagems implemented in this new community-designated hospital that specializes in treating patients with COVID-19.
32290643,Its diagnosis and treatment model has completed the treatment of COVID- 19 patients successfully.
32290643,After adjustment, this community hospital can shoulder the critical task of being a designated hospital for COVID-19, which includes admission, isolation, and therapy of suspected and mild COVID-19 patients, reducing the medical burden of superior hospitals.
32290643,Furthermore, our experience provides concepts for community hospitals to temporarily undertake medical responsibilities to reduce the spread of COVID-19 during the pandemic.
32290754,The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) has been declared a pandemic by the WHO that claimed the lives of thousands of people within a few months.
32290754,Cancer patients represent a vulnerable population due to the acquired immunodeficiency associated with anti-cancer therapy.
32290754,Immune checkpoint inhibitors have largely impacted the prognosis of a multitude of malignancies with significant improvement in survival outcomes and a different, tolerable toxicity profile.
32290754,In this paper, we assess the safety of ICI administration in cancer patients during the coronavirus pandemic in order to guide the usage of these highly efficacious agents.
32290839,A severe pneumonia-associated respiratory syndrome caused by a new coronavirus was identified in December 2019 (COVID-19), spread rapidly and has become a world-wide public health challenge.
32290839,About 25% of COVID-19 patients experienced severe complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and even progressed into an intensive care unit (ICU) admission and died.
32290839,The exploration for the mortality causes and advancing novel therapeutic development of severe COVID-19 is crucial at the moment.
32290839,The biopsy samples analysis at autopsy suggested that increased alveolar exudate caused by aberrant host immune response and inflammatory cytokine storm probably impedes alveolar gas exchange and contributes to the high mortality of severe COVID-19 patients.
32290839,Our research has identified that pathogenic T cells and inflammatory monocytes incite inflammatory storm with large amount of interleukin 6, therefore monoclonal antibody that targets the IL-6 pathways may potentially curb inflammatory storm.
32290839,Moreover, Tocilizumab treatment that blocking IL-6 receptors showed inspiring clinical results including temperature returned to normal quickly and respiratory function improved.
32290839,Therefore, we suggest that Tocilizumab is an effective treatment in severe patients of COVID-19 to calm the inflammatory storm and reduce mortality.
32291076,The outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection is spreading globally and quickly, leading to emerging health issues.
32291076,SARS-CoV-2 enters into and infects host cells through its spike glycoprotein recognizing the cell receptor Angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2).
32291076,Here, we noticed that ACE2 was further enhanced by SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32291076,Human germ cells and early embryos express high level of ACE2.
32291076,Notably, RNA-seq result showed that reduction of H3K27me3, but not H3K4/9/36me3, led to upregulation of Ace2 expression in mouse germ cell line GC-2.
32291076,In agreement with this result, we found in human embryonic stem cells that ACE2 expression was significantly increased in absence of EZH2, the major enzyme catalyzing H3K27me3.
32291076,ChIP-seq analysis further confirmed decrease of H3K27me3 signal and increase of H3K27ac signal at ACE2 promoter upon EZH2 knockout.
32291076,Therefore, we propose that EZH2-mediated H3K27me3 at ACE2 promoter region inhibits ACE2 expression in mammalian cells.
32291076,This regulatory pattern may also exist in other human cells and tissues.
32291076,Our discovery provides clues for pathogenesis and targeted drug therapy towards ACE2 expression for prevention and adjuvant therapy of COVID-19.
32291112,COVID-19 has rapidly developed into a worldwide pandemic with a significant health and economic burden.
32291112,There are currently no approved treatments or preventative therapeutic strategies.
32291112,Hundreds of clinical studies have been registered with the intention of discovering effective treatments.
32291112,Here, we review currently registered interventional clinical trials for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 to provide an overall summary and insight into the global response.
32291505,Since December 2019, a novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly spread around the world resulting in an acute respiratory illness pandemic.
32291505,The majority of patients presents with mild symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32291505,However, about 5% become critically ill and require intensive care treatment.
32291505,Acute hypoxemic failure with severe dyspnea and an increased respiratory rate (&gt;30/min) usually leads to ICU admission.
32291505,At that point, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates are typically seen.
32291505,Patients often develop a severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
32291505,To date there is no specific treatment available-the main goal of supportive therapy is to ascertain adequate oxygenation.
32291505,Early intubation and repeated prone positioning are key elements in treating hypoxemic COVID-19 patients.
32291505,Strict adherence to basic infection control measures (including hand hygiene) and use of personal protection equipment (PPE) are essential in the care of patients.
32291505,Procedures that lead to formation of aerosols should be avoided where possible and carried out with utmost precaution.
32291526,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the virus responsible for the aggressive coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.
32291526,Recently, investigators have stipulated that COVID-19 patients receiving angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) may be subject to poorer outcomes.
32291526,This editorial presents the available evidence to guide treatment practices during this pandemic.
32291526,Recent studies from Wuhan cohorts provide valuable information about COVID-19.
32291526,A cohort with 52 critically ill patients revealed cardiac injury in 12% of patients.
32291526,Worse outcomes appear to be more prevalent in patients with hypertension and diabetes mellitus (DM), possibly due to overexpression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in airway alveolar epithelial cells.
32291526,Investigators suspect that SARS-CoV-2 uses the ACE2 receptor to enter the lungs in a mechanism similar to SARS-CoV.
32291526,Several hypotheses have been proposed to date regarding the net effect of ACEI/ARB on COVID-19 infections.
32291526,Positive effects include ACE2 receptor blockade, disabling viral entry into the heart and lungs, and an overall decrease in inflammation secondary to ACEI/ARB.
32291526,Negative effects include a possible retrograde feedback mechanism, by which ACE2 receptors are upregulated.
32291526,Even though physiological models of SARS-CoV infection show a theoretical benefit of ACEI/ARB, these findings cannot be extrapolated to SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19.
32291526,Major cardiology scientific associations, including ACC, HFSA, AHA, and ESC Hypertension Council, have rejected these correlation hypotheses.
32291526,After an extensive literature review, we conclude that there is no significant evidence to support an association for now, but given the rapid evolvement of this pandemic, findings may change.
32291542,In December 2019, pneumonia of unknown cause occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
32291542,On 7 January 2020, a novel coronavirus, named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified in the throat swab sample of one patient.
32291542,The World Health Organization (WHO) announced the epidemic disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32291542,Currently, COVID-19 has spread widely around the world, affecting more than seventy countries.
32291542,China, with a huge burden of this disease, has taken strong measures to control the spread and improve the curative rate of COVID-19.
32291542,In this review, we summarized the epidemiological characteristics, clinical features, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of COVID-19.
32291542,A comprehensive understanding will help to control the disease.
32291797,The recent global severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic is changing the world we live in.
32291797,As we learn about the virus and the pandemic, it is becoming evident that it is an age-associated problem that affects the human population.
32291797,Severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 is one of seven coronaviruses known to infect humans.
32291797,These are large enveloped non-segmented positive-sense RNA viruses.
32291797,Our knowledge of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 is extremely recent but is growing daily.
32291797,There are currently no antiviral treatments against the virus or vaccines for its prevention.
32291797,The long term consequences of the infection on human health remain uncertain but extrapolations can be made about the potential effects of the virus on cellular lifespan as well as on organismal healthspan.
32291797,Here, we posit that severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 infection may, in the long-term, lead to accelerated aging phenotypes in survivors, not only in affected tissues but also in other organs, including the brain.
32291797,Since some of the effects could manifest months or years after infection, it will be necessary to follow carefully people affected by coronavirus disease 2019.
32291797,Keeping accurate registries may enable us to, in the future, establish connections with aging-associated disorders, such as Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders.

32291906,We appreciate the opportunity to respond to the comments by Dr.
32291906,Marongiu et al., they presented that as only laboratory findings of Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) but no bleeding was mentioned, indicating that there was not an overt DIC in our patients, instead, the abnormal laboratory findings could be an expression of local DIC, i.e. a pulmonary vascular thrombosis.
32291906,Thus they suggested the anticoagulant treatment in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32291968,Since its outbreak in December 2019 in China, the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has rapidly spread and affected several countries.
32291968,It has resulted in a difficult situation for cancer patients owing to the risks of the epidemic situation outbreak as well as cancer.
32291968,Patients with cancer are more likely than the general population to contract COVID-19 because of the systemic immunosuppressive status caused by malignant diseases or anticancer treatment.
32291968,Lung cancer has the highest morbidity and mortality in China and the world.
32291968,Most patients with lung cancer are smokers with poor underlying lung conditions and low immunity, thus it is vital to protect them from epidemic diseases during cancer treatment.
32291968,It is necessary to provide individualized medical treatment and management of treatment-related adverse events for patients with lung cancer based on patients' conditions and regional epidemic patterns.

32292012,术后患者病情得到不同程度缓解，所有患者仍在住院治疗。
32292012,医务人员均未发生院内感染。
32292012,<b>结论：</b> 对新型冠状病毒肺炎危重型患者行气管切开术，能够获得一定的疗效，但需要有效控制气管切开术相关并发症及院内感染的发生，术前应仔细权衡气管切开术风险获益比。.
32292113,The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has grown to be a global public health emergency since patients were first detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.
32292113,As of April 9, 2020, the novel coronavirus (named as SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, ICTV on Feb 11) has infected 83,251 and 1,484,811 patients in China and the world, respectively.
32292113,However, we have neither confirmed effective antiviral medications nor vaccines available to deal with this emergency.
32292113,In this commentary, we offer an alternative promising therapy for COVID-19, that is, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) transplantation.
32292205,Since December 2019, increasing cases of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are being detected worldwide.
32292205,The purpose of this paper is to provide a scientific reference for the global prevention and control of COVID-19.
32292205,General demographic characteristics, epidemiological history, and clinical symptoms of COVID-19 were collected that had been reported on the websites of multiple Municipal Health Commissions in China.
32292205,We herein describe distributions in time, place, and population of COVID-19.
32292205,As of midnight on February 10, 2020, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China was 42,638, and the province with the largest number of confirmed cases was Hubei (31728), followed by Guangdong (1177), Zhejiang (1117), and Henan (1105) province.
32292205,The number of cases and the speed of confirmed cases in provinces other than Hubei were more moderate than those of the Hubei province.
32292205,The median (interquartile range) age of 1740 patients with COVID-19 was 44 (33, 54) years, with a range of 10 months to 89 years.
32292205,The COVID-19 epidemic should be considered a global threat and the steps for control include early diagnosis and treatment, as well as isolation.
32292260,Since the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak was declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
32292260,Several dental care facilities in affected countries have been completely closed or have been only providing minimal treatment for emergency cases.
32292260,However, several facilities in some affected countries are still providing regular dental treatment.
32292260,This can in part be a result of the lack of universal protocol or guidelines regulating the dental care provision during such a pandemic.
32292260,This lack of guidelines can on one hand increase the nosocomial COVID-19 spread through dental health care facilities, and on the other hand deprive patients' in need of the required urgent dental care.
32292260,Moreover, ceasing dental care provision during such a period will incense the burden on hospitals emergency departments already struggle with the pandemic.
32292260,This work aimed to develop guidelines for dental patients' management during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.
32292260,Guidelines for dental care provision during the COVID-19 pandemic were developed after considering the nature of COVID-19 pandemic, and were based on grouping the patients according to condition and need, and considering the procedures according to risk and benefit.
32292260,It is hoped that the guidelines proposed in this work will help in the management of dental care around the world during and after this COVID-19 pandemic.
32292517,<b>Rationale:</b> The increasing speed of confirmed 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) cases is striking in China.
32292517,The purpose of this study is to summarize the outcomes of patients with novel COVID-19 pneumonia (NCP) at our institution. <b>Methods:</b> In this single-center study, we retrospectively included 118 cases of NCP, from January 16, 2020 to February 4, 2020.
32292517,The clinical outcomes were monitored up to February 11, 2020.
32292517,The outcomes of NCP patients were phase summarized at our institution.
32292517,Three kinds of responses to clinical treatment were defined and evaluated: 1) good, symptoms continually improved; 2) fair, symptoms not improved or relapsed; 3) poor, symptoms aggravated.
32292517,The risk factors, including basal clinical characteristics, CT imaging features, and follow-up CT changes (no change, progress, and improvement) related to poor/fair outcomes, were also investigated. <b>Results:</b> Six patients were improved to no-emergency type, 2 remained the same, and 2 progressed to fatal type.
32292517,Besides, 13 patients progressed from the common type group to the emergency group (3 in fatal type and 10 in severe type).
32292517,Forty-two (35.6%) patients were discharged with a median hospital stay of 9.5 days (range, 4.0-15.0 days).
32292517,Thus, the numbers in different responses were, 73 patients in good response group (4 emergency cases, 69 no-emergency cases), 28 in fair response group (3 emergency cases, 25 no-emergency cases), and 17 in poor response group (3 emergency cases, 14 no-emergency cases).
32292517,No patient has died in our hospital to date.
32292517,The median duration of progress observed from CT scans was 6 days (range, 2-14 days).
32292517,The progression in abnormal imaging findings indicate a poor/fair response, whereas the alleviated symptoms seen from CT suggest a good response. <b>Conclusion:</b> Most cases are no-emergency type and have a favorable response to clinical treatment.
32292517,Follow-up CT changes during the treatment can help evaluate the treatment response of patients with NCP.
32292529,The World Health Organization has declared the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as a pandemic on 11 March 2020, after the number of confirmed cases outside China increased 13-fold.
32292529,As the epicentre of the initial outbreak, China has been updating the National COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guideline with up-to-date information about the disease.
32292529,To facilitate the implementation of integrative Chinese-Western Medicine in COVID-19 management, Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been recommended in recent editions of the national guideline.
32292529,The national guideline summarised the opinions and frontline experience of medical experts across the country to provide by far the best management for COVID-19.
32292529,We extracted the case definition and clinical classifications of COVID-19 in China along with relevant TCM treatments cited in the seventh edition of the guideline, with an intend to disseminate practical information to TCM practitioners and researchers around the world.
32292529,We presented the most recent case definition, clinical classifications, and relevant TCM treatments of COVID-19 in accordance to recommendations of the Chinese guideline.
32292529,TCM treatments are stratified into two groups based on patients' disease status.
32292529,Four types of Chinese patent medicines are recommended for suspected COVID-19 cases.
32292529,Several herbal formulae are recommended for confirmed COVID-19 cases according to their clinical classification and TCM pattern diagnoses.
32292529,Two herbal formulae are also recommended for rehabilitation of recovering cases.
32292529,To control the waves of COVID-19 outbreak, countries must ensure the adherence of their citizens to local public health measures.
32292529,Medical professionals should diagnose and treat patients according to up-to-date guidelines.
32292529,Future evaluation of the outcomes of implementing TCM recommendations will strengthen the evidence base for COVID-19 management for the sake of public health and the internationalisation of TCM.
32292587,Corona virus disease 2019 SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is a zoonotic virus causing a variety of severe of respiratory diseases.
32292587,SARS-CoV-2 is closest to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in structure.
32292587,The highly prevalence of COVID-19 is due to the lack onset of symptoms.
32292587,Our study aimed to present an overview of the virus in terms of structure, epidemiology, symptoms, treatment, and prevention.
32292587,Conduct the differences of whole genome sequence and some viral proteins to determine the gap and the change alternation of nucleotides and amino acids sequences.
32292587,We evaluate 11 complete genome sequence of different coronavirus using BAST and MAFFT software.
32292587,We also selected 7 types of structural proteins.
32292587,We were conclude that COVID-19 might be created new mutations specifically in glycoproteins hence requires caution and complete preparation by health authorities.
32292623,The recent pneumonia outbreak caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Chinais posing a great threat to global public health.
32292623,Therefore, rapid and a accurate identification of pathogenic viruses plays a vital role in selecting appropriate treatments, saving people's lives and preventing epidemics.
32292623,It is important to establish a quick standard diagnostic test for the detection of the infectious disease (COVID-19) to prevent subsequent secondary spread.
32292623,Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is regarded as a gold standard test for the molecular diagnosis of viral and bacterial infections with high sensitivity and specificity.
32292623,Isothermal nucleic acid amplification is considered to be a highly promising candidate method due to its fundamental advantage in quick procedure time at constant temperature without thermocycler operation.
32292623,A variety of improved or new approaches also have been developed.
32292623,This review summarizes the currently available detection methods for coronavirus nucleic acid.
32292623,It is anticipated that this will assist researchers and clinicians in developing better techniques for timely and effective detection of coronavirus infection.
32292627,H7N9 viruses quickly spread between mammalian hosts, and it carried out the risk of human-to-human transmission after outbreak in 2013.
32292627,Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), lung failure, and fulminant pneumonia are major lung diseases in H7N9 patients.
32292627,Transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is a promising choice for treating virus-induced pneumonia, and was needed to treat H7N9 induced ARDS at the time.
32292627,MSCs transplant into patients with H7N9 induced ARDS were conducted in a single center and open-label clinical trial.
32292627,Based on the principle of voluntariness and informed consent, 44 patients with H7N9 induced ARDS were included as a control group while 17 patients with H7N9 induced ARDS were served as an experimental group with allogeneic menstrual blood-derived MSC.
32292627,Notably, MSC transplantation significantly lower the mortality compared with in control group (17.6% died in MSC group vs 54.5% died in control group).
32292627,Furthermore, MSC transplantation did not result in harmful effects in human body within the 5 year follow up period with 4 patients.
32292627,Collectively, these results suggest that MSCs significantly improve survival rate of H7N9 induced ARDS and provide a theoretical basis for the treatment of H7N9 induced ARDS in both preclinical research and clinical studies.
32292627,Because H7N9 and the corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) share similar complications (such as ARDS and lung failure) and corresponding multi-organ dysfunction, MSC-based therapy could be a possible alternative for treating COVID-19.
32292632,To introduce the emergency management of nursing human resources and material resources of a large general hospitals when facing the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19).
32292632,The Nursing Department of the hospital fully executed its functional authority to establish a three-level echelon of sustainable support, allocate human recourses dynamically, organize pre-service training, supervise the key working steps, formulate positive incentive methods, and deploy medical supplies scientifically.
32292632,By taking these strategies, the hospital effectively improved the coping capacity of the nursing team and played a positive role in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.
32292632,The emergency management of nursing human resources and material resources for COVID-19 of the hospital is successful.
32292632,But several deficiencies were identified as well, which indicated that the hospital needs to establish an efficient emergency management system, and pay attention to the practice of nursing emergency plans to enhance coping capacities in public health emergencies.
32292634,To standardize the holistic care for patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32292634,The consensus was preliminarily formed by combining relevant literature findings and frontline medical working experiences, and it was eventually confirmed by five rounds of online discussions and expert consultations.
32292634,This consensus included nursing assessment, nursing priorities, nursing goals, and thirteen key points of nursing procedures such as nursing of oxygen therapy and respiratory nursing.
32292634,This scientific and practical consensus guideline can provide clinical guidance on the holistic nursing care of patients with severe COVID-19.
32292636,This article aims to summarize a series of contingency management strategies of the Nursing Department in the centralized treatment of patients with coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19).
32292636,The strategies of the Nursing Department included early warning for prevention and control, taking functions of vertically commanding and horizontally coordinating, and reasonably allocating nursing workforce, to facilitate centralized treatment work in the in-hospital fever clinic, isolation wards and ICU, and referral and admission of critical patients.
32292636,Five special groups were established in charge of training and examination, management and supervision, psychological support, logistical support, and reporting and publicity, respectively.
32292636,It was achieved that no deaths from critical patients and no medical staff, no other patients were infected.
32292636,Through the implementation of these strategies, safe and efficient centralized treatment was ensured timely, orderly and sustainably.
32292686,In December 2019, some cases of viral pneumonia were epidemiologically related to a new coronavirus in the province of Hubei, China.
32292686,Subsequently, there has been an increase in infections attributable to this virus throughout China and worldwide.
32292686,The World Health Organization (WHO) has officially named the infection coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus has been classified as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32292686,This appears to be a virus from <i>Rhinolophus</i> bats, but the intermediate host has not yet been identified.
32292686,The mechanism of infection of SARS-CoV-2 is not yet known; it appears to have affinity for cells located in the lower airways, where it replicates.
32292686,The interhuman transmission of coronaviruses mainly occurs through saliva droplets and direct and indirect contact via surfaces.
32292686,As of March 10, 2020, the number of cases worldwide was 113,702.
32292686,Along with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS), COVID-19 appears to cause a severe clinical picture in humans, ranging from mild malaise to death by sepsis/acute respiratory distress syndrome.
32292686,The prognosis is worse in elderly patients with comorbidities.
32292686,To date, there is no specific therapy for COVID-19.
32292686,Prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection implies strategies that limit the spread of the virus.
32292686,WHO and other international and national bodies have developed continuously updated strategic objectives and provisions to contain the spread of the virus and infection.
32292691,This study investigates the propagation power and effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in light of published data.
32292691,We examine the factors affecting COVID-19 together with the spatial effects, and use spatial panel data models to determine the relationship among the variables including their spatial effects.
32292691,Using spatial panel models, we analyse the relationship between confirmed cases of COVID-19, deaths thereof, and recovered cases due to treatment.
32292691,We accordingly determine and include the spatial effects in this examination after establishing the appropriate model for COVID-19.
32292691,The most efficient and consistent model is interpreted with direct and indirect spatial effects.
32292693,The current health crisis caused by COVID-19 is a challenge for oncology treatment, especially when it comes to radiotherapy.
32292693,Cancer patients are already known to be very fragile and COVID-19 brings about the risk of severe respiratory complications.
32292693,In order to treat patients safely while protecting medical teams, the entire health care system must optimize the way it approaches prevention and treatment at a time when social distancing is key to stemming this pandemic.
32292693,All indications and treatment modalities must be re-discussed.
32292693,This is particularly the case for radiotherapy of bone metastases for which it is possible to reduce the number of sessions, the frequency of transport and the complexity of treatments.
32292693,These changes will have to be discussed according to the organization of each radiotherapy department and the health situation, while medical teams must remain vigilant about the risks of complications of bone metastases, particularly spinal metastases.
32292693,In this short piece, the members of the GEMO (the European Study Group of Bone Metastases) offer a number of recommendations to achieve the above objectives, both in general and in relation to five of the most common situations on radiation therapy for bone metastases.
32292697,The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) reminds us of the SARS outbreak in 2003, and up to date, corticosteroid is commonly administrated to severe patients with COVID-19.
32292697,Osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is a common disabling complication among convalescent SARS patients who received corticosteroid therapy.
32292697,In China, a considerable number of convalescent SARS patients with steroid-associated ONFH had undergone conservative treatment by Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), and this study aims to evaluate the long-term results of a spleen-invigorating Huo-Gu Formula (HGF) therapy in these patients. and methods: A total of 33 convalescent SARS patients (nine males and 24 females) with bilateral steroid-associated ONFH (66 hips) were enrolled in this study.
32292697,All patients received oral HGF therapy for six months when they were confirmed the diagnosis of steroid-associated ONFH.
32292697,They had been regularly followed up at an interval of one year.
32292697,Harris hip score and medical imaging modalities, including plain radiography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, were performed to evaluate the outcomes.
32292697,Based on average 14 years of follow-up of HGF therapy (ranging from six to 16 years), 38 hips (57%) among the 66 hips developed definite osteoarthritis, and 14 hips (26%) in 53 pre-collapse hips (ARCO stage I or II) progressed to femoral head collapse(ARCO stage III or IV).
32292697,Only five patients (also five hips) underwent total hip arthroplasty, and the mean hip survival time was over 15 years by the Kaplan-Meier analysis.
32292697,We observed a mean Harris hip score of 63 points, which represented the reserve of 55% in pain score and 70% in physical function score.
32292697,The severity of groin pain was not correlated to the severity of osteoarthritis.
32292697,Chinese herbal HGF therapy demonstrates beneficial effects on preventing femoral head collapse, delaying total hip arthroplasty (THA)surgery, and maintaining physical function in the treatment of steroid-associated ONFH.
32292697,HGF therapy might be therefore a good alternative for the treatment of steroid-associated ONFH secondary to rheumatologic and infection diseases.
32292802,Wuhan, the city in Hubei province in China is in the focus of global community due to the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), formerly known as 2019-nCoV.
32292802,The virus emerged in humans from Wuhan seafood market probably via zoonotic transmission.
32292802,Within a few days the virus spread its tentacles rapidly to neighboring cities in China and to different geographical regions through travelers and to some extent by human to human transmission leading to significant disease burden globally.
32292802,More than 2,00,000 people (including more than 8000 deaths) have been infected with this respiratory illness across 167 countries and territories worldwide leading to a pandemic.
32292802,The present review provides an outline about emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 from Wuhan, China in 2019-2020.
32292802,We have also provided information about the classification, genome, proteins, clinical presentation of COVID-19, type of clinical specimens to be collected and diagnostic methods adopted to identify the respiratory illness.
32292802,In addition we have also provided information about transmission dynamics, prevention measures and treatment options that are available at the present.
32292802,Subsequently, we have given a comprehensive overview of the spread of this infection from China to the other parts of the globe.
32292802,Management of the ongoing outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 encompassing surveillance, clinical, immunological, genetic and evolutionary investigations are likely to provide the desired results.
32292802,Joint efforts of global scientific community are needed at this hour in terms of enhancement of research on development of accurate diagnostics, antiviral therapeutics and finally into formation of an effective vaccine against the emerging novel coronavirus.
32292805,The COVID-19 outbreak is now one of the most critical crises to manage for most of the national healthcare systems in the world.
32292805,In the absence of authorised pharmacological treatments, many antiretrovirals, including darunavir/cobicistat fixed combination, were used off-label in the hospital wards as life-treating medicines for COVID-19 patients.
32292805,Unfortunately, for most of them, the drug products available on the market are not designed to be administered by a nasogastric tube to inpatients of intensive care units.
32292805,Therefore, their manipulation, even if it can strongly affect the product quality, is necessary for the preparation of suspension to meet patients' need.
32292805,In this situation, it is urgent to provide data and guidance to support hospital pharmacist and clinicians in their activity.
32292805,The data in this article indicate that darunavir/cobicistat suspensions compounded by pharmacists using as active ingredient a commercially available tablet can be stable at least for one week.
32292817,Our coalition of public health experts, doctors, and scientists worldwide want to draw attention to the need for high-quality evaluation protocols of the potential beneficial effect of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) as a post-exposure drug for exposed people, meaning people with close contact with positive tested patients, including home and medical caregivers.
32292817,We have reviewed the mechanisms of antiviral effect of HCQ, the risk-benefit ratio taking into consideration the PK/PD of HCQ and the thresholds of efficacy.
32292817,We have studied its use as an antimalarial, an antiviral, and an immunomodulating drug and concluded that the use of HCQ at does matching that of the standard treatment of Systemic Lupus erythematous, which has proven safety and efficacy in terms of HCQ blood and tissue concentration adapted to bodyweight (2,3), at 6 mg/kg/day 1 (loading dose) followed by 5 mg/kg/day, with a maximum limit of 600 mg/day in all cases should swiftly be clinically evaluated as a post-exposure drug for exposed people.
32292826,Since the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak was identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, a strong response from the research community has been observed with the proliferation of independent clinical trials assessing diagnostic methods, therapeutic and prophylactic strategies.
32292826,While there is no intervention for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19 with proven clinical efficacy to date, tools to distil the current research landscape by intervention, level of evidence and those studies likely powered to address future research questions is essential.
32292826,This living systematic review aims to provide an open, accessible and frequently updated resource summarising the characteristics of COVID-19 clinical trial registrations.
32292826,Weekly search updates of the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and source registries will be conducted.
32292826,Data extraction by two independent reviewers of trial characteristic variables including categorisation of trial design, geographic location, intervention type and targets, level of evidence and intervention adaptability to low resource settings will be completed.
32292826,Descriptive and thematic synthesis will be conducted.
32292826,A searchable and interactive visualisation of the results database will be created, and made openly available online.
32292826,Weekly results from the continued search updates will be published and made available on the Infectious Diseases Data Observatory (IDDO) website ( COVID-19 website).
32292826,This living systematic review will provide a useful resource of COVID-19 clinical trial registrations for researchers in a rapidly evolving context.
32292826,In the future, this sustained review will allow prioritisation of research targets for individual patient data meta-analysis.
32292837,Starting from Wuhan, China, SARS-CoV-2 has been a catastrophic epidemic involving many countries worldwide.
32292837,After China, Italy has been heavily affected and severe measures to limit the spread have been taken in the last weeks.
32292837,Radiation Oncology departments must guarantee optimal cancer treatments even in such a challenging scenario of an ongoing aggressive epidemic.
32292837,Adopted preventive measures and recommendations are highlighted for patients, professionals and clinical operations to minimize the risk of infection while safely treating cancer patients.
32292839,During a global pandemic the benefit of routine visits and treatment of cancer patients must be weighed against the risks to patients, staff, and society.
32292839,Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers Radiation Oncology departments treat, and efficient resource utilization is essential in the setting of a pandemic.
32292839,Herein, we aim to establish recommendations and a framework by which to evaluate prostate radiotherapy management decisions.
32292839,Radiation Oncologists from the United States and United Kingdom rapidly conducted a systematic review and agreed upon recommendations to safely manage prostate cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32292839,A RADS framework was created: Remote visits, and Avoidance, Deferment, and Shortening of radiotherapy was applied to determine appropriate approaches.
32292839,Recommendations are provided by National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) risk group, including clinical node positive, post-prostatectomy, oligometastatic, and low volume M1 disease.
32292839,Across all prostate cancer stages, telemedicine consultations and return visits were recommended when resources/staff available.
32292839,Delays in consultations and return visits was deemed safe based on stage of disease between 1-6 months.
32292839,Treatment can be avoided or delayed until safe for very low, low, and favorable intermediate-risk disease.
32292839,Unfavorable intermediate-risk, high-risk, clinical node positive, recurrence post-surgery, oligometastatic, and low-volume M1 disease can receive neoadjuvant hormone therapy for 4-6 months as necessary.
32292839,Ultrahypofractionation was preferred for localized, oligometastatic, and low volume M1, and moderate hypofractionation was preferred for post-prostatectomy and clinical node positive disease.
32292839,Salvage was preferred to adjuvant radiation.
32292839,Resources can be reduced for all identified stages of prostate cancer.
32292839,The RADS (Remote visits, and Avoidance, Deferment, and Shortening of radiotherapy) framework can be applied to other disease sites to help with decision making in a global pandemic.
32292842,Breast radiotherapy accounts for a significant proportion of patient volume in contemporary radiation oncology practice.
32292842,In the setting of anticipated resource constraints and widespread community infection with SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic, measures for balancing both infectious and oncologic risk among patients and providers must be carefully considered.
32292842,Here, we present evidence-based guidelines for omitting or abbreviating breast cancer radiotherapy, where appropriate, in an effort to mitigate risk to patients and optimize resource utilization.
32292842,Multidisciplinary breast cancer experts at a high-volume comprehensive cancer center convened contingency planning meetings over the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic to review the relevant literature and establish recommendations for the application of hypofractionated and abbreviated breast radiation regimens.
32292842,Substantial evidence exists to support omitting radiation among certain favorable risk subgroups of breast cancer patients and for abbreviating or accelerating regimens among others.
32292842,For those who require either whole-breast or post-mastectomy radiation, with or without coverage of the regional lymph nodes, a growing body of literature supports various hypofractionated approaches that appear safe and effective.
32292842,In the setting of a public health emergency with the potential to strain critical healthcare resources and place patients at infection risk, the parsimonious application of breast radiotherapy may alleviate a significant clinical burden without compromising long term oncologic outcomes.
32292842,The judicious and personalized use of immature study data may be warranted in the setting of a competing mortality risk from this widespread pandemic.
32292847,In the throes of the current COVID-19 pandemic, interest has burgeoned in the cardiovascular complications of this virulent viral infection.
32292847,As troponin, a biomarker of cardiac injury, often rises in hospitalized patients, its interpretation and actionability require careful consideration.
32292847,Fulminant myocarditis due to direct viral infection can certainly occur, but patients with increased oxygen demands due to tachycardia and fever, and reduced oxygen delivery due to hypotension and hypoxemia can cause myocardial injury indirectly.
32292847,Cytokines released during the acute infection can elicit activation of cells within pre-existing atherosclerotic lesions, augmenting thrombotic risk and risk of ischemic syndromes.
32292847,Moreover, microvascular activation by cytokines can cause not only myocardial injury but harm other organ systems commonly involved in COVID-19 infections including the kidneys.
32292847,Dealing with the immense challenge of COVID-19 disease, confronted with severely ill patients in dire straits with virtually no rigorous evidence base to guide our therapy, we must call upon our clinical skills and judgment.
32292847,These touchstones can help guide us in selecting patients who might benefit from the advanced imaging and invasive procedures that present enormous logistical challenges in the current context.
32292847,Lacking a robust evidence base, pathophysiologic reasoning can help guide our choices of therapy for individual clinical scenarios.
32292847,We must exercise caution and extreme humility, as often plausible interventions fail when tested rigorously.
32292847,But act today we must, and understanding the multiplicity of mechanisms of myocardial injury in COVID-19 infection will help us meet our mission unsupported by the comfort of strong data.
32292848,The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), a contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV2), has reached pandemic status.
32292848,As it spreads across the world, it has overwhelmed healthcare systems, strangled the global economy and led to a devastating loss of life.
32292848,Widespread efforts from regulators, clinicians and scientists are driving a rapid expansion of knowledge of the SARS-CoV2 virus and the COVID-19 disease.
32292848,We review the most current data with a focus on our basic understanding of the mechanism(s) of disease and translation to the clinical syndrome and potential therapeutics.
32292848,We discuss the basic virology, epidemiology, clinical manifestation, multi-organ consequences, and outcomes.
32292848,With a focus on cardiovascular complications, we propose several mechanisms of injury.
32292848,The virology and potential mechanism of injury form the basis for a discussion of potential disease-modifying therapies.
32292866,The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), also known as coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a major pandemic challenging health care systems around the world.
32292866,The optimal management of COVID-19 infected patients is still unclear, although the consensus is moving towards the need of a biphasic approach.
32292866,During the first phase of the disease (from onset of the symptoms up to 7-10 days) viral-induced effects are prominent with the opportunity to institute antiviral therapy.
32292866,In the second inflammatory phase of the disease, immunosuppressive strategies (for example with glucocorticoids or anti-cytokines drugs)may be considered.
32292866,This latter stage is characterized by the development of progressive lung involvement with increasing oxygen requirements and occasionally signs of the haemophagocitic syndrome.
32292866,The management of the disease in patients with kidney disease is even more challenging, especially in those who are immunosuppressed or with severe comorbidities.
32292866,Here we present the therapeutic approach employed in Brescia (Italy) for managing kidney transplant and hemodialysis patients with COVID-19.
32292866,Furthermore, we provide some clinical and physiopathological background, as well as preliminary outcome data of our cohort, in order to better clarify the pathogenesis of the disease and clinical management.
32292904,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly infective disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus (SARS-CoV-2).
32292904,Previous studies of the COVID-19 pneumonia outbreak were based on information from the general population.
32292904,Limited data are available for hemodialysis patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.
32292904,This report describes the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in an in-center hemodialysis patient, as well as our experience in implementing steps to prevent the spread of COVID-19 pneumonia among in-center hemodialysis patients.
32292904,The diagnosis, infection control, and treatment of COVID-19 in hemodialysis patients are discussed in this report, and we conclude with recommendations for how a dialysis facility can respond to COVID-19 based on our experiences.
32292909,The COVID-19 pandemic, after it was reported in December 2019, is a highly contagious and now spreading to over 190 countries, causing a severe public health burden.
32292909,Currently, there is no vaccine or specific drug to treat COVID-19, which is caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-2-CoV.
32292909,For this emergency, the FDA has approved Remdesivir and Hydroxychloroquine for treatment of COVID-19 as Emergency Use Authorization.
32292909,However, even after this pandemic, COVID-19 may still have a chance to come back.
32292909,Therefore, we need to come out with new strategies for drug discovery for combating COVID-19 in the future.
32292917,The correct management of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 and acute coronary syndrome is still uncertain.
32292917,We describe the percutaneous treatment of an unprotected left main coronary artery in a patient who is positive for coronavirus disease 2019 with unstable angina, dyspnea and fever.
32292917,Particular attention will be dedicated to the measures adopted in the catheterization laboratory to protect the staff and to avoid further spread of the infection. (<b>Level of Difficulty: Intermediate.</b>).
32293003,Systemic arterial hypertension (referred to as hypertension herein) is a major risk factor of mortality worldwide, and its importance is further emphasized in the context of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection referred to as COVID-19.
32293003,Patients with severe COVID-19 infections commonly are older and have a history of hypertension.
32293003,Almost 75% of patients who have died in the pandemic in Italy had hypertension.
32293003,This raised multiple questions regarding a more severe course of COVID-19 in relation to hypertension itself as well as its treatment with renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers, e.g. angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs).
32293003,We provide a critical review on the relationship of hypertension, RAS, and risk of lung injury.
32293003,We demonstrate lack of sound evidence that hypertension per se is an independent risk factor for COVID-19.
32293003,Interestingly, ACEIs and ARBs may be associated with lower incidence and/or improved outcome in patients with lower respiratory tract infections.
32293003,We also review in detail the molecular mechanisms linking the RAS to lung damage and the potential clinical impact of treatment with RAS blockers in patients with COVID-19 and a high cardiovascular and renal risk.
32293003,This is related to the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells, and expression of ACE2 in the lung, cardiovascular system, kidney, and other tissues.
32293003,In summary, a critical review of available evidence does not support a deleterious effect of RAS blockers in COVID-19 infections.
32293003,Therefore, there is currently no reason to discontinue RAS blockers in stable patients facing the COVID-19 pandemic.
32293020,Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) can cause severe respiratory failure and distressing symptoms including fever, cough, breathlessness and anxiety.
32293020,Symptomatic (palliative) treatment is of fundamental importance both in conjuncture with life-sustaining interventions and in end of life care.
32293020,Based on the evidence to date, there are several treatment options to consider for the relief of fever (acetaminophen, NSAID, oral glucocorticoids), cough (morphine), breathlessness (morphine, oxygen, fan), anxiety (benzodiazepines) and pain (NSAID, morphine).
32293020,Top priorities include precautions to protect staff and people at-risk from infection and planning how to provide adequate treatment for each individual depending on setting, including palliative care.
32293168,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a newly emerging human infectious disease caused by acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, previously called 2019-nCoV).
32293168,Based on the rapid increase in the rate of human infection, the World Health Organization (WHO) has classified the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic.
32293168,Because no specific drugs or vaccines for COVID-19 are yet available, early diagnosis and management are crucial for containing the outbreak.
32293168,Here, we report a field-effect transistor (FET)-based biosensing device for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples.
32293168,The sensor was produced by coating graphene sheets of FET with a specific antibody against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.
32293168,The performance of the sensor was determined using antigen protein, cultured virus, and nasopharyngeal swab specimens from COVID-19 patients.
32293168,Our FET device could detect SARS-CoV-2 spike protein at concentrations of 1 fg/ml in PBS and 100 fg/ml clinical transport medium.
32293168,In addition, the FET sensor successfully detected SARS-CoV-2 in culture medium (limit of detection [LOD]: 1.6 x 10<sup>1</sup> pfu/ml) and clinical samples (LOD: 2.42 x 10<sup>2</sup> copies/ml).
32293168,Thus, we have successfully fabricated a promising FET biosensor for SARS-CoV-2; our device is a highly sensitive immunological diagnostic method for COVID-19 that requires no sample pretreatment or labeling.
32293713,The discovery of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are causing public health emergency.
32293713,A handful of literatures have summarized its clinical and radiologic features, whereas therapies for COVID-19 are rather limited.
32293713,In order to evaluate the efficacy of convalescent plasma therapy in COVID-19 patients, we did this timely descriptive study. 6 laboratory confirmed COVID-19 patients were enrolled and received the transfusion of ABO-compatible convalescent plasma.
32293713,The efficacy of this intervention was determined by the alleviation of symptoms, changes in radiologic abnormalities and laboratory tests.
32293713,No obvious adverse effect observed during the treatment.
32293713,Transfusion of convalescent plasma led to a resolution of ground glass opacities (GGOs) and consolidation in patient #1, #2, #3, #4 and #6.
32293713,In patient #1 and #5 who presented with SARS-CoV-2 in throat swab, convalescent plasma therapy elicited an elimination of virus.
32293713,Serologic analysis indicated an immediate increase in anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers in patient #2 and #3, but not in patient #1.
32293713,This study indicates that convalescent plasma therapy is effective and specific for COVID-19.
32293713,This intervention has a special significance for eliminating SARS-CoV-2 and is believed to be a promising state-of-art therapy during COVID-19 pandemic crisis.

32293714,There has been a global outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) since December 2019.
32293714,In clinical practice, not only fever and respiratory tract symptoms but also multiple organ symptoms are observed in patients diagnosed with COVID-19.
32293714,Herein, we report a rare case of a patient diagnosed with COVID-19 who manifested with concomitant neurological symptoms.
32293714,The patient developed fever and respiratory symptoms at disease onset, followed by muscle soreness, and subsequently altered consciousness and psychiatric symptoms, with positive signs based on neurological examination.
32293714,The patient tested positive for the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acid (throat swab).
32293714,Further, chest computed tomography (CT) revealed typical COVID-19 findings, and head CT did not reveal significant abnormalities.
32293714,The patient recovered after treatment and was discharged.
32293714,This rare case indicates that SARS-CoV-2 can invade the central nervous system, thus causing neurological symptoms and signs.

32293715,Surgeons urgently need guidance on how to deliver surgical services safely and effectively during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32293715,The aim was to identify the key domains that should be considered when developing pandemic preparedness plans for surgical services.
32293715,A scoping search was conducted to identify published articles relating to management of surgical patients during pandemics.
32293715,Key informant interviews were conducted with surgeons and anaesthetists with direct experience of working during infectious disease outbreaks, in order to identify key challenges and solutions to delivering effective surgical services during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32293715,Thirteen articles were identified from the scoping search, and surgeons and anaesthetists representing 11 territories were interviewed.
32293715,To mount an effective response to COVID-19, a pandemic response plan for surgical services should be developed in advance.
32293715,Key domains that should be included are: provision of staff training (such as patient transfers, donning and doffing personal protection equipment, recognizing and managing COVID-19 infection); support for the overall hospital response to COVID-19 (reduction in non-urgent activities such as clinics, endoscopy, non-urgent elective surgery); establishment of a team-based approach for running emergency services; and recognition and management of COVID-19 infection in patients treated as an emergency and those who have had surgery.
32293715,A backlog of procedures after the end of the COVID-19 pandemic is inevitable, and hospitals should plan how to address this effectively to ensure that patients having elective treatment have the best possible outcomes.
32293715,Hospitals should prepare detailed context-specific pandemic preparedness plans addressing the identified domains.
32293715,Specific guidance should be updated continuously to reflect emerging evidence during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32293807,Several antiretroviral drugs are being considered for the treatment of COVID-19, the disease caused by a newly identified coronavirus, (SARS-CoV-2).
32293807,We systematically reviewed the clinical outcomes of using antiretroviral drugs for the prevention and treatment of coronaviruses and planned clinical trials.
32293807,Three databases were screened from inception to 30 March 2020 for studies reporting clinical outcomes of patients with SARS, MERS or COVID-19 treated with antiretrovirals.
32293807,From an initial screen of 433 titles, two randomized trials and 24 observational studies provided clinical outcome data on the use of antiretroviral drugs; most studies reported outcomes using LPV/r as treatment.
32293807,Of the 21 observational studies reporting treatment outcomes, there were three studies among patients with SARS, six studies among patients with MERS and 12 studies among patients with COVID-19.
32293807,In one randomized trial 99 patients with severe COVID-19 illness were randomized to receive LPV/r (400/100 mg twice a day) and 100 patients to standard of care for 14 days: LPV/r was not associated with a statistically significant difference in time to clinical improvement, although LPV/r given within 12 days of symptoms was associated with shorter time to clinical improvement; 28 day mortality was numerically lower in the LPV/r group (14/99) compared to the control group (25/100), but this difference was not statistically significant.
32293807,The second trial found no benefit.
32293807,The certainty of the evidence for the randomized trials was low.
32293807,In the observational studies 3 out of 361 patients who received LPV/r died; the certainty of evidence was very low.
32293807,Three studies reported a possible protective effect of LPV/r as post-exposure prophylaxis.
32293807,Again, the certainty of the evidence was very low due to uncertainty due to limited sample size.
32293807,On the basis of the available evidence it is uncertain whether LPV/r and other antiretrovirals improve clinical outcomes or prevent infection among patients at high risk of acquiring COVID-19.
32293831,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) stands out as the major pandemic that we have experienced in the last century.
32293831,As it affects every social structure, it brought the importance of intensive care support once again to the agenda of healthcare system after causing severe acute respiratory syndrome.
32293831,The precautions to be taken against this virus, where our knowledge is extremely small, intensive care units take an indispensable place in pandemic planning.
32293831,In this review, we aimed to emphasize the crucial points regarding intensive care management of COVID-19 patients, which we have written not only for intensivists but also for all healthcare professionals.
32293834,Currently, there is not any specific effective anti-viral treatment for COVID-19.
32293834,Although most of the COVID-19 patients have mild or moderate courses, up to 5-10% can have severe, potentially life-threatening course and there is an urgent need for effective drugs.
32293834,Optimized supportive care remains the mainstay of therapy.
32293834,There have been more than 300 clinical trials going on, various antiviral and immunomodulating agents are in various stages of evaluation for COVID-19 in those trials and some of them will be published in the next couple of months.
32293834,Despite the urgent need to find an effective antiviral treatment for COVID-19 through randomized controlled studies, certain agents are being used all over the world based on either in-vitro or extrapolated evidence or observational studies.
32293834,The most frequently used agents both in Turkey and all over the world including chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, favipiravir and remdesivir will be reviewed here .
32293834,Nitazoxanide and ivermectin were also included in this review as they have recently been reported to have an activity against SARS-CoV-2 in-vitro and are licensed for the treatment of some other human infections.
32293835,On January 30, 2020, the WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak a public health emergency of international concern and, in March 2020, began to characterize it as a pandemic in order to emphasize the gravity of the situation and urge all countries to take action in detecting infection and preventing spread.
32293835,Unfortunately, there is no medication that has been approved by the FDA, gone through controlled studies and demonstrated an effect on the virus for this global pandemic.
32293835,Although there are cures for illnesses and developments made by leaps and bounds in our day, the strongest and most effective weapon that society has against this virus that is effecting not just health but also economics, politics, and social order, is the prevention of its spread.
32293835,The main points in preventing the spread in society are hand hygiene, social distancing and quarantine.
32293835,With increased testing capacity, detecting more COVID-19 positive patients in the community will also enable the reduction of secondary cases with stricter quarantine rules.
32293910,Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted health and economy worldwide on an unprecedented scale.
32293910,Patients have diverse clinical outcomes, but those with pre-existing cardiovascular (CV) disease, hypertension, and related conditions incur disproportionately worse outcome.
32293910,The high infectivity of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is in part related to new mutations in the receptor binding domain, and acquisition of a furin cleavage site in the S spike protein.
32293910,The continued viral shedding in the asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals enhances its community transmission.
32293910,The virus uses the ACE2 receptor for internalization, aided by TMPRSS2 protease.
32293910,The tissue localization of the receptors correlates with COVDI-19 presenting symptoms and organ dysfunction.
32293910,Virus-induced ACE2 down regulation may attenuate its function, diminish its anti-inflammatory role, and heightened angiotensin II effects in the predisposed patients.
32293910,Lymphopenia occurs early and is prognostic, potentially associated with reduction of the CD4+ and some CD8+ T cells.
32293910,This leads to imbalance of the innate/acquired immune response, delayed viral clearance, and hyper stimulated macrophages and neutrophils.
32293910,Appropriate type I interferon pathway activation is critical for virus attenuation, and balanced immune response.
32293910,Persistent immune activation in predisposed patients, such as the elderly and those with CV risk, can lead to hemophagocytosis like syndrome, with uncontrolled amplification of cytokine production, leading to multi-organ failure and death.
32293910,In addition to the airways and lungs, the cardiovascular system is often involved in COVID-19 early, reflected in the release of highly sensitive troponin and natriuretic peptides, which are all extremely prognostic, particularly in those showing continued rise, along with cytokines such as IL-6.
32293910,Inflammation in the vascular system can result in diffuse microangiopathy with thrombosis.
32293910,Inflammation in the myocardium can result in myocarditis, heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, acute coronary syndrome, rapid deterioration and sudden death.
32293910,Aggressive support based on early prognostic indicators with expectant management can potentially improve recovery.
32293910,Appropriate treatment for heart failure, arrhythmias, acute coronary syndrome and thrombosis remain important.
32293910,Specific evidence based treatment strategies for COVID-19 will emerge with ongoing global collaboration on multiple approaches being evaluated.
32293910,To protect the wider population, antibody testing and effective vaccine will be needed to make COVID-19 history.
32294077,The goal of this column is to inform mental health care professionals about the evolving way the diagnosis of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is being made, with emphasis on tests to assist in making the diagnosis and to determine the presence of antibodies to the virus.
32294077,This column also provides some general information about the disease, its relative risks, and efforts to develop effective treatments.
32294077,Links to credible websites that are being continuously updated are also provided for readers who want more information and to stay current with ongoing developments.
32294179,Individuals with diabetes are at increased risk for bacterial, mycotic, parasitic and viral infections.
32294179,The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV2 (also referred to as COVID-19) coronavirus pandemic highlights the importance of understanding shared disease pathophysiology potentially informing therapeutic choices in individuals with Type 2 diabetes (T2D).
32294179,Two coronavirus receptor proteins, Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) and Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 (DPP4) are also established transducers of metabolic signals and pathways regulating inflammation, renal and cardiovascular physiology, and glucose homeostasis.
32294179,Moreover, glucose-lowering agents such as the DPP4 inhibitors, widely used in subjects with T2D, are known to modify the biological activities of multiple immunomodulatory substrates.
32294179,Here we review the basic and clinical science spanning the intersections of diabetes, coronavirus infections, ACE2, and DPP4 biology, highlighting clinical relevance and evolving areas of uncertainty underlying the pathophysiology and treatment of T2D in the context of coronavirus infection.
32294289,We read with interest the study published by Tang and coll.<sup>1</sup> in a recent issue of the Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis.
32294289,In this retrospective analysis, conducted at the Tongji Hospital of Wuhan, China, it is reported that heparin treatment reduces mortality in subjects affected by severe COVID-19 who have &quot;sepsis-induced coagulopathy&quot;.
32294289,The definition of severe COVID-19 was the presence of at least one of following: respiratory rate ≥30 breaths /min; arterial oxygen saturation ≤93% at rest; PaO2/FiO2 ≤300 mmHg.
32294289,The Authors of this study also reported that, among subjects not treated with heparin, mortality raised according with D-dimer levels.
32294289,Of note, patients that received heparin in this study were mostly treated with enoxaparin, at the thromboprophylactic dose of 40-60 mg/day, for at least 7 days.
32294485,In December 2019, COVID-19 outbreak occurred in Wuhan.
32294485,Data on the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with severe COVID-19 are limited.
32294485,The severity on admission, complications, treatment, and outcomes of COVID-19 patients were evaluated.
32294485,Patients with COVID-19 admitted to Tongji Hospital from January 26, 2020 to February 5, 2020 were retrospectively enrolled and followed-up until March 3, 2020.
32294485,Potential risk factors for severe COVID-19 were analyzed by a multivariable binary logistic model.
32294485,Cox proportional hazard regression model was used for survival analysis in severe patients.
32294485,We identified 269 (49.1%) of 548 patients as severe cases on admission.
32294485,Elder age, underlying hypertension, high cytokine levels (IL-2R, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-a), and high LDH level were significantly associated with severe COVID-19 on admission.
32294485,The prevalence of asthma in COVID-19 patients was 0.9%, markedly lower than that in the adult population of Wuhan.
32294485,The estimated mortality was 1.1% in nonsevere patients and 32.5% in severe cases during the average 32 days of follow-up period.
32294485,Survival analysis revealed that male, elder age, leukocytosis, high LDH level, cardiac injury, hyperglycemia, and high-dose corticosteroid use were associated with death in patients with severe COVID-19.
32294485,Patients with elder age, hypertension, and high LDH level need careful observation and early intervention to prevent the potential development of severe COVID-19.
32294485,Severe male patients with heart injury, hyperglycemia, and high-dose corticosteroid use may have high risk of death.
32294562,The COVID-19 has now been declared a global emergency by the World Health Organization.
32294562,There is an emergent need to search for possible medications.
32294562,Utilization of the available sequence information, homology modeling, and in slico docking a number of available medications might prove to be effective in inhibiting the COVID-19 two main drug targets the spike glycoprotein and the 3CL protease.
32294562,Several compounds were determined from the in silico docking models that might prove to be effective inhibitor for the COVID-19.
32294562,Several antiviral medications: Zanamivir, Indinavir, Saquinavir, and Remdesivir show potential as and 3CL<sup>PRO</sup> main proteinase inhibitors and as a treatment of COVID-19.
32294562,Zanamivir, Indinavir, Saquinavir, and Remdesivir are among the exciting hits on the 3CL<sup>PRO</sup> main proteinase.
32294562,It is also exciting to uncover that Flavin Adenine Dinucleotide (FAD) Adeflavin, B2 Deficiency medicine, and Coenzyme A, a coenzyme, may also be potentially used for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections.
32294562,The use of these off-label medications may be beneficial in the treatment of the COVID-19.
32294763,The enormous increase in patients with severe respiratory distress due to the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak requires a systematic approach to optimize ventilated patient at risk flow.
32294763,A standardised algorithm called &quot;SAVE&quot; was developed to distribute patients with COVID-19 respiratory distress syndrome requiring invasive ventilation.
32294763,This program is established by now in Berlin.
32294763,An instrumental bottleneck of this approach is the vacant slot assignment in the intensive care unit to guarantee constant patient flow.
32294763,The transfer of the patients after acute care treatment is needed urgently to facilitate the weaning process.
32294763,In a next step we developed a triage algorithm to identify patients at SAVE intensive care units with potential to wean and transfer to weaning institutions - we called POST SAVE.
32294763,This manuscript highlights the algorithms including the use of a standardised digital evaluation tool, the use of trained navigators to facilitate the communication between SAVE intensive care units and weaning institutions and the establishment of a prospective data registry for patient assignment and reevaluation of the weaning potential in the future.
32294763,Die enorme Zunahme von Patienten mit schwerer respiratorischer Insuffizienz aufgrund der COVID19-Pandemie erfordert einen systematischen Ansatz zur Optimierung der Betreuung von beatmeten Patienten.
32294763,Ein standardisierter Algorithmus namens „SAVE“ wurde in Berlin entwickelt, um Patienten mit COVID-19-Infektion, die eine invasive Beatmung benötigen, zu lenken.
32294763,Um Bettenkapazitäten auf den Intensivstationen sicherzustellen, muss eine konstante Patientenentlassung gewährleistet sein.
32294763,Ein strukturierter Entlassungsprozess der Patienten nach der Akutbehandlung ist dringend erforderlich.
32294763,In einem nächsten Schritt haben wir einen Triage-Algorithmus entwickelt, um Patienten auf SAVE-Intensivstationen zu identifizieren, die das Potenzial haben, von der Beatmung entwöhnt zu werden und in dafür spezialisierte Einrichtungen zu verlegen.
32294763,Dieser Prozess ist das POST-SAVE-Konzept.
32294763,In der vorliegenden Arbeit werden die Algorithmen dargestellt, einschließlich der Verwendung einer standardisierten digitalen Datenbank, der Verwendung geschulter Lotsen zur Erleichterung der Kommunikation zwischen SAVE-Intensivstationen und Weaningeinheiten und der Etablierung eines prospektiven Datenregisters, um Patienten dauerhaft hinsichtlich ihres Weaningpotenzials reevaluieren zu können.
32294807,At present, there are no studies demonstrating the clinical efficacy of hydroxychloroquine for the prophylaxis or treatment of COVID-19 infection.
32294811,The treatment of critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) faces compelling challenges.
32294811,In this issue, we'd like to share our first-line treatment experience in treating COVID-19.
32294811,Hemodynamics need be closely monitored and different types of shock should be distinguished.
32294811,Vasoconstrictor drugs should be used rationally and alerting of complications is of the same importance.
32294811,The risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) needs to be assessed, and effective prevention should be carried out for high-risk patients.
32294811,It is necessary to consider the possibility of pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) in patients with sudden onset of oxygenation deterioration, respiratory distress, reduced blood pressure.
32294811,However, comprehensive analysis of disease state should be taken into the interpretation of abnormally elevated D-Dimer.
32294811,Nutritional support is the basis of treatment.
32294811,It's important to establish individual therapy regimens and to evaluate, monitor and adjust dynamically.
32294811,Under the current epidemic situation, convalescent plasma can only be used empirically, indications need to be strictly screened, the blood transfusion process should be closely monitored and the curative effect should be dynamically evaluated.
32294811,新型冠状病毒肺炎（COVID-19）危重型患者的救治面临严峻挑战。
32294811,循环状态需严密监测并鉴别不同类型的休克，合理应用血管收缩药物，警惕并发症。
32294811,评估静脉血栓栓塞症（VTE）风险，高危者需实施有效预防，对突然出现氧合恶化、呼吸窘迫、血压下降等临床表现者需警惕肺血栓栓塞症（PTE）的发生，但对D-二聚体异常增高的解读需结合疾病的严重状态综合分析。
32294811,营养支持作为基础治疗手段，应制定个体化营养方案，评估并动态调整。
32294811,当前疫情下，恢复期血浆只能经验性应用，适应证需严格把控，输血过程中严密监测并动态评估疗效。.
32294813,Definite evidence has shown that the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) could be transmitted from person to person, so far more than 1 700 bedside clinicians have been infected.
32294813,A lot of respiratory treatments for critically ill patients are deemed as high-risk factors for nosocomial transmission, such as intubation, manual ventilation by resuscitator, noninvasive ventilation, high-flow nasal cannula, bronchoscopy examination, suction and patient transportation, etc, due to its high possibility to cause or worsen the spread of the virus.
32294813,As such, we developed this consensus recommendations on all those high-risk treatments, based on the current evidence as well as the resource limitation in some areas, with the aim to reduce the nosocomial transmission and optimize the treatment for the COVID-19 pneumonia patients.
32294813,Those recommendations include: (1)Standard prevention and protection, and patient isolation; (2)Patient wearing mask during HFNC treatment; (3)Using dual limb ventilator with filters placed at the ventilator outlets, or using heat-moisture exchanger (HME) instead of heated humidification in single limb ventilator with HME placed between exhalation port and mask; avoid using mask with exhalation port on the mask; (4)Placing filter between resuscitator and mask or artificial airway; (5)For spontaneous breathing patients, placing mask for patients during bronchoscopy examination; for patients receiving noninvasive ventilation, using the special mask with bronchoscopy port to perform bronchoscopy; (6)Using sedation and paralytics during intubation, cuff pressure should be maintained between 25-30 cmH(2)O(1 cmH(2)O=0.098 kPa); (7)In-line suction catheter is recommended and it can be used for one week; (8)Dual-limb heated wire circuits are recommended and only changed with visible soiled; (9)For patients who need breathing support during transportation, placing an HME between ventilator and patient; (10)PSV is recommended for implementing spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), avoid using T-piece to do SBT.
32294813,When tracheotomy patients are weaned from ventilator, HME should be used, avoid using T-piece or tracheostomy mask.
32294813,(11)Avoid unnecessary bronchial hygiene therapy; (12) For patients who need aerosol therapy, dry powder inhaler metered dose inhaler with spacer is recommended for spontaneous breathing patients; while vibrating mesh nebulizer is recommended for ventilated patients and additional filter is recommended to be placed at the expiratory port of ventilation during nebulization.
32294813,自首例新型冠状病毒肺炎确诊以来，已有大量人传人的病例，其中超过1 700例医护人员遭受了感染。
32294813,对危重症患者进行呼吸治疗时有大量高危操作，例如气管插管、简易呼吸器辅助通气、无创正压通气、高流量鼻导管治疗、气管镜检查、吸痰以及转运等均可引起或加重患者气道内呼出病毒的大量传播。
32294813,因此，我们根据目前最佳证据以及国内现有条件制定了本防范建议，旨在降低医护人员感染风险的同时为患者提供最佳治疗。.
32294816,The case reports 2 cases of novel coronavirus pneumonia diagnosed by concurrent bronchoalveolar lavage in our hospital, 1 case had a history of epidemiology, clinical symptoms and high imaging suspicion, but repeated negative throat swabs.
32294816,One patient was diagnosed 2019-nCoV.
32294816,Before the patient was discharged, the clinical symptoms disappeared, the chest CT showed significant improvement, and the pharynx swab was twice negative, reaching the discharge standard.We detected the ORF 1ab gene, the N gene and the nucleic acid of the new coronavirus in the broncho-alveolar lavage fluid of 2 patients.
32294816,The results showed that the positive rate of bronchoalveolar lavage for detection of new coronavirus nucleic acid was high, and bronchoalveolar lavage for suspected or confirmed new coronavirus pneumonia patients with negative detection of nucleic acid in pharynx swabs but still residual lung lesions was helpful for early diagnosis, treatment and prognosis.
32294816,本文报道我院收治并行支气管肺泡灌洗诊断新型冠状病毒肺炎2例，1例有流行病学史、临床症状及影像学高度疑似，但反复咽拭子阴性患者；1例确诊新型冠状病毒肺炎患者，出院前临床症状消失，胸部CT显示影像学表现明显好转，咽拭子2次阴性，达到出院标准。
32294816,我们对2例患者的支气管肺泡灌洗液，分别进行新冠病毒ORF 1ab基因、N基因及新冠病毒核酸检测。
32294816,结果表明，支气管肺泡灌洗液新型冠状病毒核酸检测阳性率高，对疑诊或者确诊新型冠状病毒肺炎患者出院咽拭子核酸检测阴性但肺部仍残留病灶行支气管肺泡灌洗有助于尽早诊断及指导治疗、判断预后。.
32294817,The rapid spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global threat.
32294817,But the pathogenesis and treatment of the disease are not clear yet.
32294817,Virological researches revealed close relationship between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV.
32294817,The experience and knowledge we gained from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), especially with regard to the time course of viral replication, host immune response and clinical progression of the patient, may provide important insights into understanding and management of COVID-19.
32294817,Clinical deterioration accompanied by decreasing viral load in the second week after symptom onset was noted both in SARS and COVID-19, suggesting that the lung damage at this phase is more related to excessive host immune response rather than uncontrolled viral replication.
32294817,目前对于新型冠状病毒肺炎（简称：新冠肺炎）的病程机制和治疗方法的选择等方面仍有许多未知之处。
32294817,由于2019-nCoV和SARS-CoV之间的高度相似性，从严重急性呼吸综合征（severe acute respiratory syndrome，SARS）中获得的一些知识经验，尤其是患者肺部病毒复制和免疫应答的时间规律和病程的演变特征，或许能对我们深入了解和应对新冠肺炎提供重要的借鉴。.

32295323,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets, close unprotected contact, and intense aerosols-generating procedures.
32295323,Sleep study and non-invasive positive airway pressure (NIPAP) therapy can increase the risk of exposure and transmission of new coronaviruses to medical staff and patients.
32295323,China's national epidemic control has entered a critical stage of overall prevention and control together with the restoration of normal medical care delivery.
32295323,Based on the characteristics of sleep-disordered breathing, this consensus elaborates on the recommendations from the following four aspects that include patient and medical staff education, optimization of diagnostic and treatment protocols, sterilization of medical devices and the environment, and control of hospital-acquired infection.
32295323,It is emphasized that the indications for sleep study and NIPAP should be strictly defined according to the local epidemic situation.
32295323,Portable home sleep study and auto-titration positive airway pressure is recommended.
32295323,The applications of disposable nasal pressure transducer for sleep study and disposable or personal masks and ventilator tubing for NIPAP are strongly suggested.
32295323,Moreover, it is necessary to standardize the procedure of NIPAP, to separate the functional divisions in sleep lab, to comply with the protection regulations for medical personnel, and to strengthen the cleaning and disinfection management.
32295323,新型冠状病毒肺炎主要通过呼吸道飞沫、密切接触及高浓度气溶胶传播。
32295323,睡眠监测及无创正压通气治疗可增加医务人员和患者发生新型冠状病毒暴露及传播的风险。
32295323,在当前疫情防控及恢复正常医疗工作并重的关键阶段，本共识根据睡眠呼吸疾病诊疗的特点，从医患教育管理、诊疗流程优化、诊疗环境设备消毒管理、医院内感染的防控管理等四个方面制定推荐意见。
32295323,主要强调在当前疫情流行期间，需根据本地区疫情流行情况，严格睡眠监测及无创正压通气治疗的适应证，推荐采取家庭便携睡眠监测和自动压力滴定治疗，睡眠监测尽量采用一次性气流压力传感器，无创正压通气治疗推荐采用一次性或个人专用的口鼻面罩和呼吸机管路，规范无创正压通气操作，严格医务人员分级防护和睡眠诊疗区功能分区，加强仪器设备及环境清洁消毒。.
32295658,Since the first report of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, the outbreak of the disease has been continuously evolving.
32295658,Until March 17, 2020, 185, 178 cases had been confirmed, including 81,134 cases in China and 104,044 cases outside of China.
32295658,In this comment, we report the unexpected beneficial effect of a deployable rapid-assembly shelter hospital on the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.
32295658,We describe the shelter hospital maintenance, treatment mode and primary treatment methods, which will provide a valuable experience in dealing with public health emergencies, such as COVID-19, for other countries and areas.
32295811,Every month, DTB scans sources of information on treatments, disease management and other healthcare topics for key items to bring to our readers' attention and help them keep up to date.
32295811,To do this, we produce succinct, contextualised summaries of the information concerned.
32296259,In India, SARS-CoV-2 virus-induced coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has already infected close to 5500 people, causing the death of 164.
32296259,While these numbers are not comparable with values observed for the USA, Italy, or Spain, given the population of India, and the fact that the pandemic is now in an exponential stage of growth, the risks of a contagion that affects a large sector of the Indian population are real.
32296259,There are no current effective strategies to prevent the spread, other than minimizing contact through social distancing, while no fully effective drugs to prevent or treat COVID-19 exist, although several candidate drugs and repurposed antiviral and immune-modulating pharmacotherapies are being tested or in compassionate use.
32296259,One postexposure prophylaxis, convalescent (immune) plasma (CP), has shown some success in China and previously in the cure and therapy of other coronaviruses, SARS-1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome.
32296259,Drawn from current patients who are infected with COVID-19, its CP (human anti-SARS-CoV-2 plasma) might be one way to modulate the infectivity of this virus or its effects postinfection.
32296735,In response to the outbreak of COVID-19 that has been sweeping the world, scientists reconstructed the SARS-CoV-2 rapidly using a synthetic genomics platform, in order to accelerate therapeutics and vaccine development.
32296735,However, given the dual-use nature of this technology, there exists a high biosecurity risk.
32296735,This paper points out the potential risks of the engineering SARS-CoV-2 virus and puts forward 6 questions to this work.
32296735,The authors emphasize that the two basic values of safety/security and intellectual freedom of research must be considered evenly.
32296735,From the perspective of responsible development of biotechnology, this paper calls for a careful assessment to the risks of the technology, replacing risky technologies with safe ones.
32296735,The risks of publication also need to be strictly assessed.
32296735,The authors believe, in addition to enhancing the &quot;self-government&quot; and self-discipline of scientists and scientific communities, government supervision must be reinforced, laws and regulations should be improved, and global regulation framework ought to be constructed.
32296817,Investigators are employing unprecedented innovation in the design of clinical trials to rapidly and rigorously assess potentially promising therapies for COVID-19; this is in stark contrast to the continued near universal regressive practice of exclusion of pregnant and breastfeeding women from these trials.
32296817,The few trials which allow their inclusion focus on post-exposure prophylaxis or outpatient treatment of milder disease, limiting the options available to pregnant women with severe COVID-19 to compassionate use of remdesivir, or off-label drug use of hydroxychloroquine or other therapies.
32296817,These restrictions were put in place despite experience with these drugs in pregnant women.
32296817,In this Viewpoint, we call attention to the need and urgency to engage pregnant women in COVID-19 treatment trials now in order to develop data-driven recommendations regarding the risks and benefits of therapies in this unique but not uncommon population.
32296824,Due to no reliable risk stratification tool for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients at admission, we aimed to construct an effective model for early identification of cases at high risk of progression to severe COVID-19.
32296824,In this retrospective three-centers study, 372 non-severe COVID-19 patients during hospitalization were followed for more than 15 days after admission.
32296824,Patients who deteriorated to severe or critical COVID-19 and patients who kept non-severe state were assigned to the severe and non-severe group, respectively.
32296824,Based on baseline data of the two groups, we constructed a risk prediction nomogram for severe COVID-19 and evaluated its performance.
32296824,The training cohort consisted of 189 patients, while the two independent validation cohorts consisted of 165 and 18 patients.
32296824,Among all cases, 72 (19.35%) patients developed severe COVID-19.
32296824,We found that old age, and higher serum lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, the coefficient of variation of red blood cell distribution width, blood urea nitrogen, direct bilirubin, lower albumin, are associated with severe COVID-19.
32296824,We generated the nomogram for early identifying severe COVID-19 in the training cohort (AUC 0.912 [95% CI 0.846-0.978], sensitivity 85.71%, specificity 87.58%); in validation cohort (0.853 [0.790-0.916], 77.5%, 78.4%).
32296824,The calibration curve for probability of severe COVID-19 showed optimal agreement between prediction by nomogram and actual observation.
32296824,Decision curve and clinical impact curve analysis indicated that nomogram conferred high clinical net benefit.
32296824,Our nomogram could help clinicians to early identify patients who will exacerbate to severe COVID-19, which will enable better centralized management and early treatment of severe patients.
32296888,The coronavirus pandemic is a major challenge for healthcare systems worldwide.
32296888,For urology, the expansion of the health-care structures for the treatment of patients suffering from COVID-19 should be supported as best as possible.
32296888,At the same time, one should aim to ensure adequate care for urological emergencies and urgent urological treatments as far as possible, even during the pandemic.
32296888,For this, patients must be prioritized individually, alternative therapy concepts must be considered and regional and supraregional cooperation must be used.
32296888,Outpatient departments are of great importance in the care, examination and coordination of urological emergencies and urgent treatment.
32296888,Urological clinics must prepare themselves to perform urgent operations and interventions on SARS-CoV‑2-positive patients.
32296888,Here, the creation of a separate, appropriately equipped emergency operating room to perform operations and interventions on SARS-CoV‑2 patients should be considered.
32296888,Furthermore strictly defined hygiene measures to protect employees in various clinical scenarios should be set up.
32296910,Since December 2019, a novel coronavirus has spread throughout China and across the world, causing a continuous increase in confirmed cases within a short period of time.
32296910,Some studies reported cases of thrombocytopenia, but hardly any studies mentioned how the virus causes thrombocytopenia.
32296910,We propose several mechanisms by which coronavirus disease 2019 causes thrombocytopenia to better understand this disease and provide more clinical treatment options.
32297089,The development of COVID-19 syndrome in anticoagulated patients, and especially their admission to intensive-care units with acute severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), expose them to specific problems related to their therapy, in addition to those associated with the acute viral infection.
32297089,Patients on VKA hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 show high instability of PT INR due to the variability of vitamin K metabolism, diet, fasting, co-medications, liver impairment, and heart failure.
32297089,Patients on DOAC are exposed to under/over treatment caused by significant pharmacological interferences.
32297089,In consideration of the pharmacological characteristics of oral anticoagulant drugs, the multiple pharmacological interactions due to the treatment of acute disease and the possible necessity of mechanical ventilation with hospitalization in intensive-care units, we suggest replacing oral anticoagulant therapies (VKA and DOAC) with parenteral heparin to avoid the risk of over/under treatment.
32297571,Here we report on the most recent updates on experimental drugs successfully em-ployed in the treatment of the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, also referred to asCOVID-19 (COronaVIrus Disease 19).
32297571,In particular, several cases of recovered patients havebeen reported after being treated with lopinavir/ritonavir (which is widely used to treat humanimmunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection) in combination with the anti-flu drug oseltamivir.
32297571,Inaddition, remdesivir, which has been previously administered to Ebola virus patients, has alsoproven effective in the U.S. against coronavirus, while antimalarial chloroquine and hydroxy-chloroquine, favipiravir and co-administered darunavir and umifenovir (in patient therapies)were also recently recorded as having anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects.
32297571,Since the recoveries/deathsratio in the last weeks significantly increased, especially in China, it is clear that the experi-mental antiviral therapy, together with the availability of intensive care unit beds in hospitalsand rigorous government control measures, all play an important role in dealing with this vi-rus.
32297571,This also stresses the urgent need for the scientific community to devote its efforts to thedevelopment of other more specific antiviral strategies.
32297671,We explored the relationships between lymphocyte subsets, cytokines, pulmonary inflammation index (PII) and disease evolution in patients with (corona virus disease 2019) COVID-19.
32297671,A total of 123 patients with COVID-19 were divided into mild and severe groups.
32297671,Lymphocyte subsets and cytokines were detected on the first day of hospital admission and lung computed tomography results were quantified by PII.
32297671,Difference analysis and correlation analysis were performed on the two groups.
32297671,A total of 102 mild and 21 severe patients were included in the analysis.
32297671,There were significant differences in cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4<sup>+</sup> T), cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8<sup>+</sup> T), interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 10 (IL-10) and PII between the two groups.
32297671,There were significant positive correlations between CD4<sup>+</sup> T and CD8<sup>+</sup> T, IL-6 and IL-10 in the mild group (r<sup>2</sup>  = 0·694, r <sup>2</sup>  = 0·633, respectively; P &lt; 0·01).
32297671,After 'five-in-one' treatment, all patients were discharged with the exception of the four who died.
32297671,Higher survival rates occurred in the mild group and in those with IL-6 within normal values.
32297671,CD4<sup>+</sup> T, CD8<sup>+</sup> T, IL-6, IL-10 and PII can be used as indicators of disease evolution, and the PII can be used as an independent indicator for disease progression of COVID-19.
32297723,With each passing day, more cases of Coronavirus disease (COVID-2019) are being detected and unfortunately the fear of novel corona virus 2019 (2019-nCoV) becoming a pandemic disease has come true.
32297723,Constant efforts at individual, national, and international level are being made in order to understand the genomics, hosts, modes of transmission and epidemiological link of nCoV-2019.
32297723,As of now, whole genome sequence of the newly discovered coronavirus has already been decoded.
32297723,Genomic characterization nCoV-2019 have shown close homology with bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21.
32297723,Structural analysis of the receptor binding site has confirmed that 2019-nCoV binds with the same ACE 2 receptor protein as human SARS virus.
32297723,Compared to the previous coronavirus outbreaks, the overall mortality rate is relatively low for COVID-2019 (2-3%).
32297723,Suspected cases must be quarantined till their test comes positive or they clear infection.
32297723,At present, treatment of COVID-2019 is mostly based on the knowledge gained from the SARS and MERS outbreaks.
32297723,Remdesivir, originally develop as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections, is being studied for it effectiveness against 2019-nCoV infection.
32297723,Many other antiviral agents and vaccines are being tested but most of them are in phase I or II and hence unlikely to be of any benefit immediately with regards to current outbreak.
32297723,Hence, the standard infection control techniques and preventive steps for healthy individuals and supportive care for the confirmed cases is the best available strategy to deal with current viral outbreak. .
32297727,The Brescia-COVID respiratory severity scale/algorithm is a stepwise management approach to COVID-19 patients based on clinical severity.
32297727,The BCRSS was rapidly developed in Brescia, Italy, during that nation's COVID-19 crisis.
32297727,The scale has not been validated or tested in other populations.
32297727,The BCRSS uses patient examination features along with the need for escalating levels of respiratory support (NIV, intubation, proning) to suggest treatment recommendations.
32297727,The scale simplifies the clinical summary of a patient's status, and allows clinicians to compare patients to one another and to track the trend of a patient's level of respiratory severity over time.
32297843,The present global health emergency involving the emergence and rapid spread of a novel coronavirus has prompted the world scientific community to consider how it can help to fight this growing viral pandemic.
32297843,With few safe and effective drugs available to combat this threat to humanity and the normal functioning of our society, the oligonucleotide research community is uniquely positioned to apply its technology and expertise to help alleviate the crisis, thanks to its capacity for rational drug design, swift development cycles, and pursuing targets undruggable by conventional treatment strategies.
32297985,The aim of our study was to evaluate the therapeutic effect of antiviral drugs on COVID-19 pneumonia.
32297985,Patients confirmed with COVID-19 pneumonia were enrolled and divided into 7 groups according to the treatment option.
32297985,Information including age, gender and duration from illness onset to admission, clinical manifestations and laboratory data at admission, and length of hospital stay were evaluated.
32297985,The chest CT imaging obtained at admission and after a 5-d treatment cycle were assessed.
32297985,The clinical symptoms and laboratory tests at discharge were also assessed.
32297985,At admission, no significant differences were found among the groups, including duration from illness onset to admission, clinical symptoms and main laboratory results.
32297985,No significant differences were found among the groups in terms of the proportion of patients with pneumonia resolution (P=0.151) after treatment or the length of hospital stay (P=0.116).
32297985,At discharge, 7/184 (4%) patients had a mild cough while their other symptoms had disappeared, and the proportion of patients with abnormal liver function and with increased leucocytes, neutrophils or erythrocyte sedimentation rate among the 184 patients were close to those at admission.
32297985,According to the results, the inclusion of antiviral drugs in therapeutic regimens based on symptomatic treatment had no significant additional impact on the improvement in COVID-19 patients.
32297985,In addition, the results of chest CT imaging, clinical manifestations, and laboratory tests at discharge were not completely consistent.

32297987,The spread of the novel-Coronavirus infection worldwide represents a challenge for physicians.
32297987,Particularly, no approved therapy has demonstrated to have an impact in treating patients who develop severe respiratory insufficiency so far.
32297987,The use of humanized anti-human inteleukine-6 receptor antibody tocilizumab seems a promising strategy for these patients.

32297988,Following the demonstration of the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in vitro, many trials started to evaluate its efficacy in clinical settings.
32297988,However, no systematic review and meta-analysis have addressed the issue of the safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in coronavirus disease 2019.
32297988,We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis with the objectives of evaluation of safety and efficacy of HCQ alone or in combination in terms of &quot;time to clinical cure,&quot; &quot;virological cure,&quot; &quot;death or clinical worsening of disease,&quot; &quot;radiological progression,&quot; and safety.
32297988,RevMan was used for meta-analysis.
32297988,We searched 16 literature databases out of which seven studies (n = 1358) were included in the systematic review.
32297988,In terms of clinical cure, two studies reported possible benefit in &quot;time to body temperature normalization&quot; and one study reported less &quot;cough days&quot; in the HCQ arm.
32297988,Treatment with HCQ resulted in less number of cases showing the radiological progression of lung disease (odds ratio [OR], 0.31, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.11-0.9).
32297988,No difference was observed in virological cure (OR, 2.37, 95% CI, 0.13-44.53), death or clinical worsening of disease (OR, 1.37, 95% CI, 1.37-21.97), and safety (OR, 2.19, 95% CI, 0.59-8.18), when compared with the control/conventional treatment.
32297988,Five studies reported either the safety or efficacy of HCQ + azithromycin.
32297988,Although seems safe and effective, more data are required for a definitive conclusion.
32297988,HCQ seems to be promising in terms of less number of cases with radiological progression with a comparable safety profile to control/conventional treatment.
32297988,We need more data to come to a definite conclusion.
32298029,Italy and the rest of the world are experiencing an outbreak of a novel beta-coronavirus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32298029,In this context, in Italy, we reorganized the National Health System and prioritized the clinical cancer care scenario, balancing risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission versus the magnitude of clinical benefit deriving from a specific therapeutic approach.
32298029,As initial actions, we recommended that routine screening be suspended and that patients with early and advanced cancer be treated as outpatients as much as possible and at the nearest medical center.
32298029,Patients who need to be hospitalized for cancer treatment were protected from potential SARS-CoV-2 infection by creating a dedicated diagnostic and therapeutic internal pathway for cancer treatment.
32298029,We implemented reorganization of the hospital networks, based on a hub-and-spoke design.
32298029,Stronger personal protection was made available for patients with cancer.
32298029,Because of the extreme burden created by COVID-19, antitumor treatment was initiated only after considering patient performance status, comorbidities, biology of disease, and the likely impact of treatment on outcome.
32298029,Treatment strategies were discussed in the context of a multidisciplinary tumor board.
32298029,Treatment decision making balanced risk and benefits of treatment in the context of the specific pandemic level, on a case-by-case basis.
32298036,The COVID-19 pandemic has placed an extraordinary demand on the United States health care system.
32298036,Many institutions have canceled elective and non-urgent procedures to conserve resources and limit exposure.
32298036,While operational definitions of elective and urgent categories exist, there is a degree of surgeon judgment in designation.
32298036,In the present commentary, we provide a framework for prioritizing head and neck surgery during the pandemic.
32298036,Unique considerations for the head and neck patient are examined including risk to the oncology patient, outcomes following delay in head and neck cancer therapy, and risk of transmission during otolaryngologic surgery.
32298036,Our case prioritization criteria consist of four categories: urgent-proceed with surgery, less urgent-consider postpone &gt; 30 days, less urgent-consider postpone 30 to 90 days, and case-by-case basis.
32298036,Finally, we discuss our preoperative clinical pathway for transmission mitigation including defining low-risk and high-risk surgery for transmission and role of preoperative COVID-19 testing.
32298139,<b>Context.</b> Point-of-care testing (POCT), diagnostic testing at or near the site of patient care, is <u> <i>inherently spatial</i> </u>, that is, performed at points of need, and also <u> <i>intrinsically temporal</i> </u>, because it produces fast actionable results.
32298139,Outbreaks generate geospatial &quot;hotspots.&quot; <i>POC strategies</i> help control hotspots, detect spread, and speed treatment of highly infectious diseases. <b>Objectives.</b> To stop outbreaks, accelerate detection, facilitate emergency response for epidemics, mobilize public health practitioners, enhance community resilience, and improve crisis standards of care. <b>Data Sources.</b> PubMed, WWW, newsprint, others were searched until COVID-19 was declared a pandemic, the US, a national emergency, and Europe, the epicenter.
32298139,Coverage comprised interviews in Asia, email to/from Wuhan, papers, articles, chapters, documents, maps, flowcharts, schematics, and geospatial-associated concepts.
32298139,EndNote X9.1 (Clarivate Analytics) consolidated literature as abstracts, ULRs, and PDFs, recovering 136 hotspot articles.
32298139,More than 500 geospatial science articles were assessed for relevance to point-of-care testing. <b>Conclusions</b> POCT can interrupt spirals of dysfunction and delay by enhancing disease detection, decision making, contagion containment, and safe spacing, thereby softening outbreak surges and diminishing risk before human, economic, and cultural losses mount.
32298139,Point-of-care tests results identify where infected individuals spread COVID-19, when delays cause death, and how to deploy resources.
32298139,Results in national cloud databases help optimize outbreak control, mitigation, emergency response, and community resilience.
32298139,The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates unequivocally that governments must support POCT and multidisciplinary healthcare personnel must learn its principles, then adopt POC geospatial strategies, so that onsite diagnostic testing can ramp up to meet needs in times of crisis.
32298208,<b> <i>Background:</i> </b> <i>Most secondary transmission of COVID-19 is occurring in a hospital setting.
32298208,To decrease person-to-person contact, health care providers have built many isolation wards.
32298208,However, out-of-hospital professionals cannot access patient information, which has greatly reduced the efficiency of treatment; it is inconvenient for health care professionals to issue a case discussion with professionals from other wards.
32298208,This article mainly introduces a mobile telehealth system (MTS) applied to facilitate patient information presentation and case discussion.</i> <b> <i>Materials and Methods:</i> </b> <i>The MTS searches patient information, which is stored in hospital intranet, and uses five modules to display patient information.
32298208,By a request/response module and a real-time interaction module, we successfully conducted case discussions.
32298208,In addition, we took measures in three areas to prevent patient information leakage.</i> <b> <i>Results:</i> </b> <i>The system uses mobile collaboration technology to present patient information and support case discussion.
32298208,MTS was officially launched for 37 days, during which it has been used 3,061 times.</i> <b> <i>Conclusions:</i> </b> <i>The building of the MTS not only provides convenience and benefit for health care professionals, but also reduces person-to-person contact.</i>
32298245,Community mitigation activities (also referred to as nonpharmaceutical interventions) are actions that persons and communities can take to slow the spread of infectious diseases.
32298245,Mitigation strategies include personal protective measures (e.g., handwashing, cough etiquette, and face coverings) that persons can use at home or while in community settings; social distancing (e.g., maintaining physical distance between persons in community settings and staying at home); and environmental surface cleaning at home and in community settings, such as schools or workplaces.
32298245,Actions such as social distancing are especially critical when medical countermeasures such as vaccines or therapeutics are not available.
32298245,Although voluntary adoption of social distancing by the public and community organizations is possible, public policy can enhance implementation.
32298245,The CDC Community Mitigation Framework (1) recommends a phased approach to implementation at the community level, as evidence of community spread of disease increases or begins to decrease and according to severity.
32298245,This report presents initial data from the metropolitan areas of San Francisco, California; Seattle, Washington; New Orleans, Louisiana; and New York City, New York* to describe the relationship between timing of public policy measures, community mobility (a proxy measure for social distancing), and temporal trends in reported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases.
32298245,Community mobility in all four locations declined from February 26, 2020 to April 1, 2020, decreasing with each policy issued and as case counts increased.
32298245,This report suggests that public policy measures are an important tool to support social distancing and provides some very early indications that these measures might help slow the spread of COVID-19.
32298249,On February 26, 2020, the first U.S. case of community-acquired coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was confirmed in a patient hospitalized in Solano County, California (1).
32298249,The patient was initially evaluated at hospital A on February 15; at that time, COVID-19 was not suspected, as the patient denied travel or contact with symptomatic persons.
32298249,During a 4-day hospitalization, the patient was managed with standard precautions and underwent multiple aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs), including nebulizer treatments, bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) ventilation, endotracheal intubation, and bronchoscopy.
32298249,Several days after the patient's transfer to hospital B, a real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2 returned positive.
32298249,Among 121 hospital A health care personnel (HCP) who were exposed to the patient, 43 (35.5%) developed symptoms during the 14 days after exposure and were tested for SARS-CoV-2; three had positive test results and were among the first known cases of probable occupational transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to HCP in the United States.
32298249,Little is known about specific risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 transmission in health care settings.
32298249,To better characterize and compare exposures among HCP who did and did not develop COVID-19, standardized interviews were conducted with 37 hospital A HCP who were tested for SARS-CoV-2, including the three who had positive test results.
32298249,Performing physical examinations and exposure to the patient during nebulizer treatments were more common among HCP with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 than among those without COVID-19; HCP with COVID-19 also had exposures of longer duration to the patient.
32298249,Because transmission-based precautions were not in use, no HCP wore personal protective equipment (PPE) recommended for COVID-19 patient care during contact with the index patient.
32298249,Health care facilities should emphasize early recognition and isolation of patients with possible COVID-19 and use of recommended PPE to minimize unprotected, high-risk HCP exposures and protect the health care workforce.
32298480,The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant shifts in patient care including a steep decline in ambulatory visits and a marked increase in the use of telemedicine.
32298480,Infantile hemangiomas (IH) can require urgent evaluation and risk stratification to determine which infants need treatment and which can be managed with continued observation.
32298480,For those requiring treatment, prompt initiation decreases morbidity and improves long-term outcomes.
32298480,The Hemangioma Investigator Group has created consensus recommendations for management of IH via telemedicine.
32298480,FDA/EMA-approved monitoring guidelines, clinical practice guidelines, and relevant, up-to-date publications regarding initiation and monitoring of beta-blocker therapy were used to inform the recommendations.
32298480,Clinical decision-making guidelines about when telehealth is an appropriate alternative to in-office visits, including medication initiation, dosage changes, and ongoing evaluation, are included.
32298480,The importance of communication with caregivers in the context of telemedicine is discussed, and online resources for both hemangioma education and propranolol therapy are provided.
32298514,COVID-19 presents many pressing challenges to the global dermatological community and our patients with ongoing skin needs, which must be considered by every dermatology provider.
32298514,Many of these are logistical and administrative, distinct from physical manifestations, and could be summarized by the acronym COVID (Consultations, Operations, Videoconferencing, Immunosuppressive medications, Drug and equipment shortages).
32298514,While the pandemic may represent a threat to many parts of our existence, dermatologists can help the patients we care for by considering noncutaneous implications of COVID-19 upon our practice.
32298745,We report a case of a laboratory-confirmed 2019 novel coronavirus infected (known as COVID-19) patient who developed respiratory failure and shock accompanied by persistent diarrhoea despite conventional therapeutic interventions.
32298745,The patient avoided mechanical ventilation and acquired an immediate clinical and radiological improvement, after treatment of intensive plasma exchange (PE) followed by intravenous immunogloblin (IVIG).
32298745,Successful therapeutic strategies in our case suggest timely initiating PE treatment followed by IVIG in critically ill patients with COVID-19 may prevent the disease from worsening and help to reduce the requirements for mechanical ventilation and intensive supportive care.
32298745,What's more, it may improve poor clinical outcomes of these patients.
32298748,The COVID-19 pandemic is anticipated to continue spreading widely across the globe throughout 2020.
32298748,To mitigate the devastating impact of COVID-19, social distancing and visitor restrictions in health care facilities have been widely implemented.
32298748,Such policies and practices, along with the direct impact of the spread of COVID-19, complicate issues of grief that are relevant to medical providers.
32298748,We describe the relationship of the COVID-19 pandemic to anticipatory grief, disenfranchised grief, and complicated grief for individuals, families, and their providers.
32298748,Furthermore, we provide discussion regarding countering this grief through communication, advance care planning, and self-care practices.
32298748,We provide resources for health care providers, in addition to calling on palliative care providers to consider their own role as a resource to other specialties during this public health emergency.
32298767,Recent data on the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has begun to shine light on the impact of the disease on the liver.
32298767,But no studies to date have systematically described liver test abnormalities in patients with COVID-19.
32298767,We evaluated the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in patients with abnormal liver test results.
32298767,Clinical records and laboratory results were obtained from 417 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to the only referral hospital in Shenzhen, China from January 11 to February 21, 2020 and followed up to March 7, 2020.
32298767,Information on clinical features of patients with abnormal liver tests were collected for analysis.
32298767,Of 417 patients with COVID-19, 318 (76.3%) had abnormal liver test results and 90 (21.5%) had liver injury during hospitalization.
32298767,The presence of abnormal liver tests became more pronounced during hospitalization within 2 weeks, with 49 (23.4%), 31 (14.8%), 24 (11.5%) and 51 (24.4%) patients having alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin and gamma-glutamyl transferase levels elevated to more than 3× the upper limit of normal, respectively.
32298767,Patients with abnormal liver tests of hepatocellular type or mixed type at admission had higher odds of progressing to severe disease (odds ratios [ORs] 2.73; 95% CI 1.19-6.3, and 4.44, 95% CI 1.93-10.23, respectively).
32298767,The use of lopinavir/ritonavir was also found to lead to increased odds of liver injury (OR from 4.44 to 5.03, both p &lt;0.01).
32298767,Patients with abnormal liver tests were at higher risk of progressing to severe disease.
32298767,The detrimental effects on liver injury mainly related to certain medications used during hospitalization, which should be monitored and evaluated frequently.
32298767,Data on liver tests in patients with COVID-19 are scarce.
32298767,We observed a high prevalence of liver test abnormalities and liver injury in 417 patients with COVID-19 admitted to our referral center, and the prevalence increased substantially during hospitalization.
32298767,The presence of abnormal liver tests and liver injury were associated with the progression to severe pneumonia.
32298767,The detrimental effects on liver injury were related to certain medications used during hospitalization, which warrants frequent monitoring and evaluation for these patients.
32298803,The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic is a significant psychological stressor in addition to its tremendous impact on every facet of individuals' lives and organizations in virtually all social and economic sectors worldwide.
32298803,Fear of illness and uncertainty about the future precipitate anxiety- and stress-related disorders, and several groups have rightfully called for the creation and dissemination of robust mental health screening and treatment programs for the general public and front-line healthcare workers.
32298803,However, in addition to pandemic-associated psychological distress, the direct effects of the virus itself (several acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2), and the subsequent host immunologic response, on the human central nervous system (CNS) and related outcomes are unknown.
32298803,We discuss currently available evidence of COVID-19 related neuropsychiatric sequelae while drawing parallels to past viral pandemic-related outcomes.
32298803,Past pandemics have demonstrated that diverse types of neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as encephalopathy, mood changes, psychosis, neuromuscular dysfunction, or demyelinating processes, may accompany acute viral infection, or may follow infection by weeks, months, or longer in recovered patients.
32298803,The potential mechanisms are also discussed, including viral and immunological underpinnings.
32298803,Therefore, prospective neuropsychiatric monitoring of individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2 at various points in the life course, as well as their neuroimmune status, are needed to fully understand the long-term impact of COVID-19, and to establish a framework for integrating psychoneuroimmunology into epidemiologic studies of pandemics.
32298807,The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has significantly impacted the delivery of cellular therapeutics, including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells.
32298807,This impact has extended beyond patient care to include logistics, administration, and distribution of increasingly limited health care resources.
32298807,Based on the collective experience of the CAR T-cell Consortium investigators, we review and address several questions and concerns regarding cellular therapy administration in the setting of COVID-19 and make general recommendations to address these issues.
32298807,Specifically, we address (1) necessary resources for safe administration of cell therapies; (2) determinants of cell therapy utilization; (3) selection among patients with B cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas and B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia; (4) supportive measures during cell therapy administration; (5) use and prioritization of tocilizumab; and (6) collaborative care with referring physicians.
32298807,These recommendations were carefully formulated with the understanding that resource allocation is of the utmost importance, and that the decision to proceed with CAR T cell therapy will require extensive discussion of potential risks and benefits.
32298807,Although these recommendations are fluid, at this time it is our opinion that the COVID-19 pandemic should not serve as reason to defer CAR T cell therapy for patients truly in need of a potentially curative therapy.
32298981,High prevalence of diabetes makes it an important comorbidity in patients with COVID-19.
32298981,We sought to review and analyze the data regarding the association between diabetes and COVID-19, pathophysiology of the disease in diabetes and management of patients with diabetes who develop COVID-19 infection.
32298981,PubMed database and Google Scholar were searched using the key terms 'COVID-19', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'diabetes', 'antidiabetic therapy' up to April 2, 2020.
32298981,Full texts of the retrieved articles were accessed.
32298981,There is evidence of increased incidence and severity of COVID-19 in patients with diabetes.
32298981,COVID-19 could have effect on the pathophysiology of diabetes.
32298981,Blood glucose control is important not only for patients who are infected with COVID-19, but also for those without the disease.
32298981,Innovations like telemedicine are useful to treat patients with diabetes in today's times.
32298982,and Aims: No valid treatment or preventative strategy has evolved till date to counter the SARS CoV 2 (Novel Coronavirus) epidemic that originated in China in late 2019 and have since wrought havoc on millions across the world with illness, socioeconomic recession and death.
32298982,This analysis was aimed at tracing a trend related to death counts expected at the 5th and 6th week of the COVID-19 in India.
32298982,Validated database was used to procure global and Indian data related to coronavirus and related outcomes.
32298982,Multiple regression and linear regression analyses were used interchangeably.
32298982,Since the week 6 death count data was not correlated significantly with any of the chosen inputs, an auto-regression technique was employed to improve the predictive ability of the regression model.
32298982,A linear regression analysis predicted average week 5 death count to be 211 with a 95% CI: 1.31-2.60).
32298982,Similarly, week 6 death count, in spite of a strong correlation with input variables, did not pass the test of statistical significance.
32298982,Using auto-regression technique and using week 5 death count as input the linear regression model predicted week 6 death count in India to be 467, while keeping at the back of our mind the risk of over-estimation by most of the risk-based models.
32298982,According to our analysis, if situation continue in present state; projected death rate (n) is 211 and467 at the end of the 5th and 6th week from now, respectively.
32299202,In the Wuhan Province of China, in December 2019, the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a severe involvement of the lower respiratory tract leading to an acute respiratory syndrome.
32299202,Subsequently, coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) provoked a pandemic which is considered a life-threatening disease.
32299202,The SARS-CoV-2, a family member of betacoronaviruses, possesses single-stranded positive-sense RNA with typical structural proteins, involving the envelope, membrane, nucleocapsid and spike proteins that are responsible for the viral infectivity, and nonstructural proteins.
32299202,The effectual host immune response including innate and adaptive immunity against SARS-Cov-2 seems crucial to control and resolve the viral infection.
32299202,However, the severity and outcome of the COVID-19 might be associated with the excessive production of proinflammatory cytokines “cytokine storm” leading to an acute respiratory distress syndrome.
32299202,Regretfully, the exact pathophysiology and treatment, especially for the severe COVID-19, is still uncertain.
32299202,The results of preliminary studies have shown that immune-modulatory or immune-suppressive treatments such as hydroxychloroquine, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1 antagonists, commonly used in rheumatology, might be considered as treatment choices for COVID-19, particularly in severe disease.
32299202,In this review, to gain better information about appropriate anti-inflammatory treatments, mostly used in rheumatology for COVID-19, we have focused the attention on the structural features of SARS-CoV-2, the host immune response against SARS-CoV-2 and its association with the cytokine storm.
32299204,Along the centuries, novel strain of virus such as influenza produces pandemics which increase illness, death and disruption in the countries.
32299204,Spanish flu in 1918, Asian flu in 1957, Hong Kong flu in 1968 and swine flu in 2009 were known pandemic which had various characteristics in terms of morbidity and mortality.
32299204,A current pandemic is caused by novel corona virus originated from China.
32299204,COVID-19 pandemic is very similar to Spanish, Hong Kong, Asian and swine influenza pandemics in terms of spreading to world by the mobilized people.
32299204,Burden of pandemic is considered in terms of disease transmissibility and the growth rate of epidemic and duration of pandemic can be calculated by transmissibility characteristic.
32299204,The case definition, finding out cases and first case cluster, proper treatment, sufficient stockpiles of medicine and population cooperation with the containment strategy should be considered for reduction of burden of pandemic.
32299753,The COVID-19 pandemic has led to efforts at rapid investigation and application of drugs which may improve prognosis but for which safety and efficacy are not yet established.
32299753,This document attempts to provide reasonable guidance for the use of antimicrobials which have uncertain benefit but may increase risk of QT interval prolongation and ventricular proarrhythmia, notably, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and lopinavir/ritonavir.
32299753,During the pandemic, efforts to reduce spread and minimize effects on health care resources mandate minimization of unnecessary medical procedures and testing.
32299753,We recommend that the risk of drug proarrhythmia be minimized by 1) discontinuing unnecessary medications that may also increase the QT interval, 2) identifying outpatients who are likely to be at low risk and do not need further testing (no history of prolonged QT interval, unexplained syncope, or family history of premature sudden cardiac death, no medications that may prolong the QT interval, and/or a previous known normal corrected QT interval [QTc]), and 3) performing baseline testing in hospitalized patients or those who may be at higher risk.
32299753,If baseline electrocardiographic testing reveals a moderately prolonged QTc, optimization of medications and electrolytes may permit therapy.
32299753,If the QTc is markedly prolonged, drugs that further prolong it should be avoided, or expert consultation may permit administration with mitigating precautions.
32299753,These recommendations are made while there are no known effective treatments for COVID-19 and should be revisited when further data on efficacy and safety become available.
32300516,With the emergence of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) viral pandemic, there is uncertainty whether biologic agents for psoriasis may place patients at a higher risk for infection or more severe disease course.
32300516,This commentary offers patient counseling recommendations based on the current available evidence.
32300516,While there are currently no specific data for psoriasis biologics and COVID-19, data are presented here from phase III clinical trials of psoriasis biologics on rates of upper respiratory infection, influenza, and serious infection.
32300516,Overall these data reveal that on the whole, psoriasis biologics do not show major increases in infection risk compared to placebo during the course of these trials.
32300516,However, as the COVID-19 virus is a novel pathogen that is associated with mortality in a subset of patients, a cautious approach is warranted.
32300516,We discuss factors that may alter the benefit-risk ratio of biologic use during this time of COVID-19 outbreak.
32300516,Ultimately, treatment decisions should be made on the basis of dialogue between patient and provider, considering each patient's individualized situation.
32300516,Once this pandemic has passed, it is only a matter of time before a new viral disease reignites the same issues discussed here.
32300673,A new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) associated with human to human transmission and extreme human sickness has been as of late announced from the city of Wuhan in China.
32300673,Our objectives were to mutation analysis between recently reported genomes at various times and locations and to characterize the genomic structure of SARS-CoV-2 using bioinformatics programs.
32300673,Information on the variation of viruses is of considerable medical and biological impacts on the prevention, diagnosis, and therapy of infectious diseases.
32300673,To understand the genomic structure and variations of the SARS-CoV-2.
32300673,The study analyzed 95 SARS-CoV-2 complete genome sequences available in GenBank, National MicrobiologyData Center (NMDC) and NGDC Genome Warehouse from December-2019 until 05 of April-2020.
32300673,The genomic signature analysis demonstrates that a strong association between the time of sample collection, location of sample and accumulation of genetic diversity.
32300673,We found 116 mutations, the three most common mutations were 8782C&gt;T in ORF1ab gene, 28144T&gt;C in ORF8 gene and 29095C&gt;T in the N gene.
32300673,The mutations might affect the severity and spread of the SARS-CoV-2.
32300673,The finding heavily supports an intense requirement for additional prompt, inclusive investigations that combine genomic detail, epidemiological information and graph records of the clinical features of patients with COVID-19.
32300796,A novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, emerged in December 2019, leading within a few months to a global pandemic.
32300796,COVID-19, the disease caused by this highly contagious virus, can have serious health consequences, though risks of complications are highly age-dependent.
32300796,Rates of hospitalization and death are less than 0.1% in children, but increase to 10% or more in older people.
32300796,Moreover, at all ages, men are more likely than women to suffer serious consequences from COVID-19.
32300796,These patterns are familiar to the geroscience community.
32300796,The effects of age and sex on mortality rates from COVID-19 mirror the effects of aging on almost all major causes of mortality.
32300796,These similarities are explored here, and underscore the need to consider the role of basic biological mechanisms of aging on potential treatment and outcomes of COVID-19.
32301099,The COVID-19 outbreak spread in China and is a threat to the world.
32301099,We reported on the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics of children cases to help health workers better understand and provide timely diagnosis and treatment.
32301099,Retrospectively, two research centers' case series of 67 consecutive hospitalized cases including 53 adult and 14 children cases with COVID-19 between 23 Jan 2020 and 15 Feb 2020 from Jinan and Rizhao were enrolled in this study.
32301099,Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics of children and adults were analyzed and compared.
32301099,Most cases in children were mild (21.4%) and conventional cases (78.6%), with mild clinical signs and symptoms, and all cases were of family clusters.
32301099,Fever (35.7%) and dry cough (21.4%) were described as clinical manifestations in children cases.
32301099,Dry cough and phlegm were not the most common symptoms in children compared with adults (p = 0.03).
32301099,In the early stages of the disease, lymphocyte counts did not significantly decline but neutrophils count did in children compared with adults (p = 0.02).
32301099,There was a lower level of CRP (p = 0.00) in children compared with adults.
32301099,There were 8 (57.1%) asymptomatic cases and 6 (42.9%) symptomatic cases among the 14 children cases.
32301099,The age of asymptomatic patients was younger than that of symptomatic patients (p = 0.03).
32301099,Even among asymptomatic patients, 5 (62.5%) cases had lung injuries including 3 (60%) cases with bilateral involvement, which was not different compared with that of symptomatic cases (p = 0.58, p = 0.74).
32301099,The clinical symptoms of children are mild, there is substantial lung injury even among children, but that there is less clinical disease, perhaps because of a less pronounced inflammatory response, and that the occurrence of this pattern appears to inversely correlate with age.
32301155,The clinical characteristics, management, and outcome of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) after solid organ transplant (SOT) remain unknown.
32301155,We report our preliminary experience with 18 SOT (kidney [44.4%], liver [33.3%], and heart [22.2%]) recipients diagnosed with COVID-19 by March 23, 2020 at a tertiary-care center at Madrid.
32301155,Median age at diagnosis was 71.0 ± 12.8 years, and the median interval since transplantation was 9.3 years.
32301155,Fever (83.3%) and radiographic abnormalities in form of unilateral or bilateral/multifocal consolidations (72.2%) were the most common presentations.
32301155,Lopinavir/ritonavir (usually associated with hydroxychloroquine) was used in 50.0% of patients and had to be prematurely discontinued in 2 of them.
32301155,Other antiviral regimens included hydroxychloroquine monotherapy (27.8%) and interferon-β (16.7%).
32301155,As of April 4, the case-fatality rate was 27.8% (5/18).
32301155,After a median follow-up of 18 days from symptom onset, 30.8% (4/13) of survivors developed progressive respiratory failure, 7.7% (1/13) showed stable clinical condition or improvement, and 61.5% (8/13) had been discharged home.
32301155,C-reactive protein levels at various points were significantly higher among recipients who experienced unfavorable outcome.
32301155,In conclusion, this frontline report suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection has a severe course in SOT recipients.
32301198,Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is currently a pandemic with a mortality rate of 1%-6% in the general population.
32301198,However, the mortality rate seems to be significantly higher in elderly patients, especially those hospitalized with comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes, or coronary artery diseases.
32301198,Because viral diseases may have atypical presentations in immunosuppressed patients, the course of the disease in the transplant patient population is unknown.
32301198,Hence, the management of these patients with COVID-19 is an area of interest, and a unique approach is warranted.
32301198,Here, we report the clinical features and our treatment approach for a kidney transplant patient with a diagnosis of COVID-19.
32301198,We believe that screening protocols for SARS-Cov-2 should be re-evaluated in patients with solid-organ transplants.
32301284,SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 disease, is responsible for the largest pandemic since the 1918 H1N1 influenza outbreak.
32301284,The symptoms presently recognized by the World Health Organization are cough, fever, tiredness, and difficulty breathing.
32301284,Patient-reported smell and taste loss has been associated with COVID-19 infection, yet no empirical olfactory testing on a cohort of COVID-19 patients has been performed.
32301284,The University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT), a well-validated 40-odorant test, was administered to 60 confirmed COVID-19 inpatients and 60 age- and sex-matched controls to assess the magnitude and frequency of their olfactory dysfunction.
32301284,A mixed effects analysis of variance determined whether meaningful differences in test scores existed between the two groups and if the test scores were differentially influenced by sex.
32301284,Fifty-nine (98%) of the 60 patients exhibited some smell dysfunction [mean (95% CI) UPSIT score: 20.98 (19.47,22.48); controls: 34.10 (33.31,34.88); p&lt;0.0001].
32301284,Thirty-five of the 60 patients (58%) were either anosmic (15/60; 25%) or severely microsmic (20/60; 33%); 16 exhibited moderate microsmia (16/60; 27%), 8 mild microsmia (8/60; 13%), and one normosmia (1/60; 2%).
32301284,Deficits were evident for all 40 UPSIT odorants.
32301284,No meaningful relationships between the test scores and sex, disease severity, or comorbidities were found.
32301284,Quantitative smell testing demonstrates that decreased smell function, but not always anosmia, is a major marker for SARS-CoV-2 infection and suggests the possibility that smell testing may help, in some cases, to identify COVID-19 patients in need of early treatment or quarantine.

32301300,With the ongoing novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the number of individuals that need to be tested for COVID-19 has been rapidly increasing.
32301300,A walk-through (WT) screening center using negative pressure booths that is inspired by the biosafety cabinet has been designed and implemented in Korea for easy screening of COVID-19 and for safe and efficient consultation for patients with fever or respiratory symptoms.
32301300,Here, we present the overall concept, advantages, and limitations of the COVID-19 WT screening center.
32301300,The WT center increases patient access to the screening clinics and adequately protects healthcare personnel while reducing the consumption of personal protective equipment.
32301300,It can also increase the number of people tested by 9-10 fold.
32301300,However, there is a risk of cross-infection at each stage of screening treatment, including the booths, and adverse reactions with disinfection of the booths.
32301300,These limitations can be overcome using mobile technology and increasing the number of booths to reduce congestion inside the center, reducing booth volume for sufficient and rapid ventilation, and using an effective, harmless, and certified environmental disinfectant.
32301300,A WT center can be implemented in other institutions and countries and modified depending on local needs to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic.
32301600,The current outbreak of the novel 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) started in China in December 2019 and has since spread to several other countries.
32301600,On March 25, 2020, a total of 375,498 cases had been confirmed globally with 2,201 cases in Brazil, showing the urgency of reacting to this international public health emergency.
32301600,While in most cases, mild symptoms are observed, in some cases the infection leads to serious pulmonary disease.
32301600,As a result, the possible consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak for pregnant women and its potential effects on the management of assisted reproductive treatments, demand attention.
32301600,In this review, we summarize the latest research progress related to COVID-19 epidemiology and the reported data of pregnant women, and discuss the current evidence of COVID-19 infections during pregnancy and its potential consequences for assisted reproductive treatments.
32301600,Reported data suggest that symptoms in pregnant women are similar to those in other people, and that there is no evidence for higher maternal or fetal risks.
32301600,However, considering the initial data and lack of comprehensive knowledge on the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy, human reproduction societies have recommended postponing the embryo transfers and do not initiate new treatment cycles.
32301600,New evidence must be considered carefully in order to adjust these recommendations accordingly at any time and to guide assisted reproductive treatments.
32301764,The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has several implications relevant to neuroanesthesiologists, including neurologic manifestations of the disease, impact of anesthesia provision for specific neurosurgical procedures and electroconvulsive therapy, and healthcare provider wellness.
32301764,The Society for Neuroscience in Anesthesiology and Critical Care appointed a task force to provide timely, consensus-based expert guidance for neuroanesthesiologists during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32301764,The aim of this document is to provide a focused overview of COVID-19 disease relevant to neuroanesthesia practice.
32301764,This consensus statement provides information on the neurological manifestations of COVID-19, advice for neuroanesthesia clinical practice during emergent neurosurgery, interventional radiology (excluding endovascular treatment of acute ischemic stroke), transnasal neurosurgery, awake craniotomy and electroconvulsive therapy, as well as information about healthcare provider wellness.
32301764,Institutions and healthcare providers are encouraged to adapt these recommendations to best suit local needs, considering existing practice standards and resource availability to ensure safety of patients and providers.
32301766,Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a pandemic affecting millions of adults.
32301766,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2019 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative virus of COVID-19, infects host cells through angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
32301766,Pre-clinical models suggest that ACE2 upregulation confers protective effects in acute lung injury.
32301766,Additionally, renin-angiotensin aldosterone system inhibitors reduce adverse atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure and chronic kidney disease outcomes, but may increase ACE2 levels.
32301766,We review current knowledge of the role of ACE2 in cardiovascular physiology and SARS-CoV-2 virology as well as clinical data to inform the management of patients with or at risk for COVID-19 who require renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor therapy.
32301997,Although the detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral load in respiratory specimens has been widely used to diagnose coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), it is undeniable that serum SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid (RNAaemia) could be detected in a fraction of COVID-19 patients.
32301997,However, it is not clear whether testing for RNAaemia is correlated with the occurrence of cytokine storms or with the specific class of patients.
32301997,This study enrolled 48 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the General Hospital of Central Theater Command, PLA, a designated hospital in Wuhan, China.
32301997,The patients were divided into three groups according to the &quot;Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia (6th edition)&quot; issued by the National Health Commission of China.
32301997,The clinical and laboratory data were collected.
32301997,The serum viral load and IL-6 levels were determined. .
32301997,Clinical characteristics analysis of 48 cases of COVID-19 showed that RNAaemia was diagnosed only in the critically ill group and seemed to reflect the severity of the disease.
32301997,Furthermore, the level of inflammatory cytokine IL-6 in critically ill patients increased significantly, almost 10 times that in other patients.
32301997,More importantly, the extremely high IL-6 level was closely correlated with the detection of RNAaemia (R = 0.902).
32301997,Detectable serum SARS-Cov-2 RNA(RNAaemia) in COVID-19 patients was associated with elevated IL-6 concentration and poor prognosis.
32301997,Because the elevated IL-6 may be part of a larger cytokine storm which could worsen outcome, IL-6 could be a potential therapeutic target for critically ill patients with an excessive inflammatory response.
32302058,Emerging and reemerging infectious diseases are global public concerns.
32302058,With the outbreak of unknown pneumonia in Wuhan, China in December 2019, a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 has been attracting tremendous attention.
32302058,Rapid and accurate laboratory testing of SARS-CoV-2 is essential for early discovery, early reporting, early quarantine, early treatment, and cutting off epidemic transmission.
32302058,The genome structure, transmission, and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 are basically similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the other two beta-CoVs of medical importance.
32302058,During the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV epidemics, a variety of molecular and serological diagnostic assays were established and should be referred to for SARS-CoV-2.
32302058,In this review, by summarizing the articles and guidelines about specimen collection, nucleic acid tests (NAT) and serological tests for SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, several suggestions are put forward to improve the laboratory testing of SARS-CoV-2.
32302058,In summary, for NAT: collecting stool and blood samples at later periods of illness to improve the positive rate if lower respiratory tract specimens are unavailable; increasing template volume to raise the sensitivity of detection; putting samples in reagents containing guanidine salt to inactivate virus as well as protect RNA; setting proper positive, negative and inhibition controls to ensure high-quality results; simultaneously amplifying human RNase P gene to avoid false-negative results.
32302058,For antibody test, diverse assays targeting different antigens, and collecting paired samples are needed.
32302257,The outbreak and diffusion of SARS-CoV-2, responsible for the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), has caused an emergency in the health system worldwide.
32302257,After a first development in Wuhan, China, the virus spread in other countries, with Italy registering the second highest number of cases in Europe on the 7th of April 2020 (135,586 in total).
32302257,The World Health Organization declared the pandemic diffusion of COVID-19, and restrictive measures to limit contagion have been taken in several countries.
32302257,The virus has a predominantly respiratory transmission through aerosol and droplets.
32302257,The importance of infection control is therefore crucial in limiting the effects of virus diffusion.
32302257,We aim to discuss the risks related to dental practice and current recommendations for dental practitioners.
32302257,A literature search was performed to retrieve articles on the management of COVID-19 diffusion in dental practice.
32302257,The documented clinical experience, the measures of professional prevention, and the actual Italian situation were reported and described.
32302257,Four articles were retrieved from the literature search.
32302257,Among the eligible articles, 3 reported measures to contrast COVID-19 diffusion.
32302257,The infection management protocols suggested were reviewed.
32302257,Finally, recommendations based on the Italian experience in terms of patient triage, patients' entrance into the practice, dental treatment, and after-treatment management are reported and discussed.
32302257,COVID-19 is a major emergency worldwide, which should not be underestimated.
32302257,Due to the rapidly evolving situation, further assessment of the implications of COVID-19 outbreak in dental practice is needed.
32302265,<b>Rationale:</b> Use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) is a major concern for clinicians treating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients with hypertension. <b>Objective:</b> To determine the association between in-hospital use of ACEI/ARB and all-cause mortality in COVID-19 patients with hypertension. <b>Methods and Results:</b> This retrospective, multi-center study included 1128 adult patients with hypertension diagnosed with COVID-19, including 188 taking ACEI/ARB (ACEI/ARB group; median age 64 [IQR 55-68] years; 53.2% men) and 940 without using ACEI/ARB (non-ACEI/ARB group; median age 64 [IQR 57-69]; 53.5% men), who were admitted to nine hospitals in Hubei Province, China from December 31, 2019 to February 20, 2020.
32302265,Unadjusted mortality rate was lower in the ACEI/ARB group versus the non-ACEI/ARB group (3.7% vs.
32302265,9.8%; P = 0.01).
32302265,In mixed-effect Cox model treating site as a random effect, after adjusting for age, gender, comorbidities, and in-hospital medications, the detected risk for all-cause mortality was lower in the ACEI/ARB group versus the non-ACEI/ARB group (adjusted HR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.19-0.92; P =0.03).
32302265,In a propensity score-matched analysis followed by adjusting imbalanced variables in mixed-effect Cox model, the results consistently demonstrated lower risk of COVID-19 mortality in patients who received ACEI/ARB versus those who did not receive ACEI/ARB (adjusted HR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.15-0.89; P = 0.03).
32302265,Further subgroup propensity score-matched analysis indicated that, compared to use of other antihypertensive drugs, ACEI/ARB was also associated with decreased mortality (adjusted HR, 0.30; 95%CI, 0.12-0.70; P = 0.01) in COVID-19 patients with hypertension. <b>Conclusions:</b> Among hospitalized COVID-19 patients with hypertension, inpatient use of ACEI/ARB was associated with lower risk of all-cause mortality compared with ACEI/ARB non-users.
32302265,While study interpretation needs to consider the potential for residual confounders, it is unlikely that in-hospital use of ACEI/ARB was associated with an increased mortality risk.
32302280,As of March 30<sup>th</sup>, 2020 there were 161,807 total cases and 2,953 total deaths of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States, with the number of cases expected to rise.
32302280,Other than supportive care, there are no SARS-CoV-2 specific treatments available for patients discharged from the emergency department (ED) or those admitted to the hospital.
32302280,In addition, there are no vaccines available to protect our at-risk healthcare workers.
32302280,The National Institutes of Health is conducting a Phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate for a potential vaccine and the recipients have started to receive the investigational vaccine.2 We present a brief overview of the potential prophylactic and treatment agents under investigation, some which could be initiated in the ED if proven effective.
32302411,Azithromycin (AZ) is a broad-spectrum macrolide antibiotic with a long half-life and a large volume of distribution.
32302411,It is primarily used for the treatment of respiratory, enteric, and genitourinary bacterial infections.
32302411,AZ is not approved for the treatment of viral infections, and there is no well-controlled, prospective, randomized clinical evidence to support AZ therapy in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32302411,Nevertheless, there are anecdotal reports that some hospitals have begun to include AZ in combination with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine (CQ) for treatment of COVID-19.
32302411,It is essential that the clinical pharmacology (CP) characteristics of AZ be considered in planning and conducting clinical trials of AZ alone or in combination with other agents, to ensure safe study conduct and to increase the probability of achieving definitive answers regarding efficacy of AZ in the treatment of COVID-19.
32302411,The safety profile of AZ used as an antibacterial agent is well established.<sup>1</sup> This work assesses published in vitro and clinical evidence for AZ as an agent with antiviral properties.
32302411,It also provides basic CP information relevant for planning and initiating COVID-19 clinical studies with AZ, summarizes safety data from healthy volunteer studies, and safety and efficacy data from phase II and phase II/III studies in patients with uncomplicated malaria, including a phase II/III study in pediatric patients following administration of AZ and CQ in combination.
32302411,This paper may also serve to facilitate the consideration and use of a priori-defined control groups for future research.
32302419,Since the novel Coronavirus 2019, also known as COVID-19 or SARS CoV-2, crossed the Chinese borders and became pandemic, Italy has rapidly become the country with the highest number of patient deaths as well as confirmed and/or hospitalized patients, after China [1-2].
32302419,On March 12<sup>th</sup> Italy was declared a red-zone and special protocols were enacted to limit the spread of the virus.
32302419,Although COVID-19 does not have epidermotropism, cutaneous manifestations in Cov-19 positive patients have been reported [3] and departments of dermatology are considered at high risk [4] and were ordered to admit only patients needing urgent treatments or undergoing chronic immunosuppressive therapy in order to minimize nosocomial virus spread.
32302438,The severe inflammatory state secondary to Covid-19 leads to a severe derangement of hemostasis that has been recently described as a state of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and consumption coagulopathy, defined as decreased platelet count, increased fibrin(ogen) degradation products such as D-dimer as well as low fibrinogen.
32302438,Whole blood from 24 patients admitted at the intensive care unit because of Covid-19 was collected and evaluated with thromboelastography by the TEG point-of-care device on a single occasion and six underwent repeated measurements on two consecutive days for a total of 30 observations.
32302438,Plasma was evaluated for the other parameters of hemostasis.
32302438,TEG parameters are consistent with a state of hypercoagulability as shown by decreased R and K values, and increased values of K angle and MA.
32302438,Platelet count was normal or increased, prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time were near(normal).
32302438,Fibrinogen was increased and D-dimer was dramatically increased.
32302438,C-reactive protein was increased.
32302438,Factor VIII and von Willebrand factor (n=11) were increased.
32302438,Antithrombin (n=11) was marginally decreased and protein C (n=11) was increased.
32302438,The results of this cohort of patients with Covid-19 are not consistent with acute DIC, rather they support hypercoagulability together with a severe inflammatory state.
32302438,These findings may explain the events of venous thromboembolism observed in some of these patients and support antithrombotic prophylaxis/treatment.
32302438,Clinical trials are urgently needed to establish the type of drug, dosage and optimal duration of prophylaxis.
32302448,Few observations exist with respect to the pro-coagulant profile of patients with COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
32302448,Reports of thromboembolic complications are scarce but suggestive for a clinical relevance of the problem.
32302448,Prospective observational study aimed to characterize the coagulation profile of COVID-19 ARDS patients with standard and viscoelastic coagulation tests and to evaluate their changes after establishment of an aggressive thromboprophylaxis.
32302448,Sixteen patients with COVID-19 ARDS received a complete coagulation profile at the admission in the intensive care unit.
32302448,Ten patients were followed in the subsequent 7 days, after increasing the dose of low molecular weight heparin, antithrombin levels correction, and clopidogrel in selected cases.
32302448,At baseline, the patients showed a pro-coagulant profile characterized by an increased clot strength (CS, median 55 hPa, 95% interquartile range 35-63), platelet contribution to CS (PCS, 43 hPa; interquartile range 24-45), fibrinogen contribution to CS (FCS, 12 hPa; interquartile range 6-13.5) elevated D-dimer levels (5.5 μg/mL, interquartile range 2.5-6.5), and hyperfibrinogenemia (794 mg/dL, interquartile range 583-933).
32302448,Fibrinogen levels were associated (R<sup>2</sup>  = .506, P = .003) with interleukin-6 values.
32302448,After increasing the thromboprophylaxis, there was a significant (P = .001) time-related decrease of fibrinogen levels, D-dimers (P = .017), CS (P = .013), PCS (P = .035), and FCS (P = .038).
32302448,The pro-coagulant pattern of these patients may justify the clinical reports of thromboembolic complications (pulmonary embolism) during the course of the disease.
32302448,Further studies are needed to assess the best prophylaxis and treatment of this condition.
32302462,We read with interest the International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis interim guidance on recognition and management of coagulopathy in COVID-19 (1).
32302462,We applaud this group's efforts in releasing a timely article on the pandemic impacting all regions of the globe.
32302462,While we agree that this interim guidance addresses important considerations for monitoring the disease process, we believe that the proposed treatment strategy of prophylactic low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) to treat severe COVID-19 coagulopathy is an unconvincing strategy.
32302462,Patients that are critically ill with COVID-19 have hallmark signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)(2), and as noted in the ISTH interim guidance and our own clinical practice, thrombosis is the overwhelming phenotype with rare bleeding complications.
32302462,We address this concern with the existing data on the severe hypercoagulable state of COVID-19 victims and advocate for consideration of systemic anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin to prevent life threatening micro- and macrovascular thrombosis to mitigate their associated consequences, up to and including progression of respiratory and organ failure.
32302681,Because of the unprecedented disruption of health care services caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the American Society of Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) and the European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology (ESTRO) identified an urgent need to issue practice recommendations for radiation oncologists treating head and neck cancer (HNC) in a time of limited resources and heightened risk for patients and staff.
32302681,A panel of international experts from ASTRO, ESTRO, and select Asia-Pacific countries completed a modified rapid Delphi process.
32302681,Topics and questions were presented to the group, and subsequent questions were developed from iterative feedback.
32302681,Each survey was open online for 24 hours, and successive rounds started within 24 hours of the previous round.
32302681,The chosen cutoffs for strong agreement (≥80%) and agreement (≥66%) were extrapolated from the RAND methodology.
32302681,Two pandemic scenarios, early (risk mitigation) and late (severely reduced radiation therapy resources), were evaluated.
32302681,The panel developed treatment recommendations for 5 HNC cases.
32302681,In total, 29 of 31 of those invited (94%) accepted, and after a replacement 30 of 30 completed all 3 surveys (100% response rate).
32302681,There was agreement or strong agreement across a number of practice areas, including treatment prioritization, whether to delay initiation or interrupt radiation therapy for intercurrent SARS-CoV-2 infection, approaches to treatment (radiation dose-fractionation schedules and use of chemotherapy in each pandemic scenario), management of surgical cases in event of operating room closures, and recommended adjustments to outpatient clinic appointments and supportive care.
32302681,This urgent practice recommendation was issued in the knowledge of the very difficult circumstances in which our patients find themselves at present, navigating strained health care systems functioning with limited resources and at heightened risk to their health during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32302681,The aim of this consensus statement is to ensure high-quality HNC treatments continue, to save lives and for symptomatic benefit.
32302817,The fact that COVID-19 is transmissible from human to human and associated with high morbidity and potentially fatality can intensify the perception of personal danger.
32302817,In addition, the foreseeable shortage of supplies and an increasing flow of suspected and real cases of COVID-19 contribute to the pressures and concerns of health professionals.
32302817,The studies were identified in well-known international journals found in two electronic databases: Scopus and Embase.
32302817,The data were cross-checked with information from the main international newspapers.
32302817,Work-related stress is a potential cause of concern for health professionals.
32302817,It has been associated with anxiety including multiple clinical activities, depression in the face of the coexistence of countless deaths, long work shifts with the most diverse unknowns and demands in the treatment with patients with COVID-19.
32302817,Therefore, it is an important indicator of psychic exhaustion.
32302817,As coronavirus cases increase and deaths surge in Italy, new figures show an &quot;enormous&quot; level of contagion among the country's medical personnel.
32302817,At least 2,629 health workers have been infected with coronavirus since the outbreak onset in February, representing 8.3% of total cases.
32302817,The percentage of infected health workers has almost doubled the number registered in China throughout the epidemic.
32302817,Intensive care unit physicians are on their stress limit, especially when dealing with older patients and with death prospects.
32302817,Doctors, not a relative, are inevitably the last people a dying COVID-19 patient will see.
32302954,In December 2019, Wuhan, China, experienced an outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19).
32302954,The number of cases has increased rapidly, but information on the clinical characteristics remains limited.
32302954,This paper describes the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19.
32302954,Early detection and identification of critically ill patients is necessary to facilitate scientific classification and treatment.
32302954,This study included a retrospective, single-center case series of 99 consecutively hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 at Chengdu Public Health Clinical Medical Center in Chengdu, China, from January 16 to February 20, 2020.
32302954,The final date of follow-up was February 23, 2020.
32302954,We collected and analyzed epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data.
32302954,We compared outcomes of critically ill patients and noncritically ill patients.
32302954,Of the 99 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the median age was 49 years (minimum, 3 months; maximum, 87 years) and 51 (52 %) were men; 42 (42 %) had traveled to or lived in Wuhan and 48 (49 %) had come into close contact with patients with new coronavirus pneumonia; 41 (41 %) patients had underlying disease.
32302954,Common symptoms included fever (85 [86 %]), dry cough (84 [85 %]), and fatigue (72 [73 %]).
32302954,We analyzed the clinical characteristics of patients.
32302954,We expressed the measurement data as mean ± standard deviation.
32302954,We collected data for age (49.39 ± 18.45 years), number of hospital days (12.32 ± 6.70 days), and laboratory indicators.
32302954,We compared critically ill and noncritically ill patients: p-values for age, C-reactive protein, high-sensitivity troponin T, prothrombin time, fibrin degradation products, D-Dimer, and CD4+ count were p &lt; 0.001; and p-values for hospital days, white blood cell, neutrophil, lymphocyte, creatine kinase isoenzyme, myoglobin, N-terminal brain natriuretic peptide, and CD8+ count were p &lt; 0.05.
32302954,We collected data from a single-center case series of 32 hospitalized patients who were critically ill with confirmed COVID-19 in Chengdu, China, and compared data with 67 noncritically ill patients.
32302954,Elderly patients had chronic underlying diseases, notably cardiovascular disease.
32302954,Higher C-reactive protein levels, higher levels of myocardial damage, and higher brain natriuretic peptide levels; lower white blood cells, neutrophils, and lymphocytes; and lower CD4 and CD8 counts could be used for early detection and identification of critically ill patients, and dynamic Data observation was more important than at a single moment.
32302966,In December 2019, a few coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases were first reported in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
32302966,Soon after, increasing numbers of cases were detected in other parts of China, eventually leading to a disease outbreak in China.
32302966,As this dreadful disease spreads rapidly, the mass media has been active in community education on COVID-19 by delivering health information about this novel coronavirus, such as its pathogenesis, spread, prevention, and containment.
32302966,The aim of this study was to collect media reports on COVID-19 and investigate the patterns of media-directed health communications as well as the role of the media in this ongoing COVID-19 crisis in China.
32302966,We adopted the WiseSearch database to extract related news articles about the coronavirus from major press media between January 1, 2020, and February 20, 2020.
32302966,We then sorted and analyzed the data using Python software and Python package Jieba.
32302966,We sought a suitable topic number with evidence of the coherence number.
32302966,We operated latent Dirichlet allocation topic modeling with a suitable topic number and generated corresponding keywords and topic names.
32302966,We then divided these topics into different themes by plotting them into a 2D plane via multidimensional scaling.
32302966,After removing duplications and irrelevant reports, our search identified 7791 relevant news reports.
32302966,We listed the number of articles published per day.
32302966,According to the coherence value, we chose 20 as the number of topics and generated the topics' themes and keywords.
32302966,These topics were categorized into nine main primary themes based on the topic visualization figure.
32302966,The top three most popular themes were prevention and control procedures, medical treatment and research, and global or local social and economic influences, accounting for 32.57% (n=2538), 16.08% (n=1258), and 11.79% (n=919) of the collected reports, respectively.
32302966,Topic modeling of news articles can produce useful information about the significance of mass media for early health communication.
32302966,Comparing the number of articles for each day and the outbreak development, we noted that mass media news reports in China lagged behind the development of COVID-19.
32302966,The major themes accounted for around half the content and tended to focus on the larger society rather than on individuals.
32302966,The COVID-19 crisis has become a worldwide issue, and society has become concerned about donations and support as well as mental health among others.
32302966,We recommend that future work addresses the mass media's actual impact on readers during the COVID-19 crisis through sentiment analysis of news data.
32303077,The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a growing pandemic that is impacting daily life across the globe.
32303077,Though disease is often mild, in high-risk populations, severe disease often leads to intubation, intensive care admission (ICU) admission, and in many cases death.
32303077,The implications for pregnancy remain largely unknown.
32303077,Early data suggest that COVID-19 may not pose increased risk in the pregnant population.
32303077,Vertical transmission has not been confirmed.
32303077,Because no treatment, no vaccine and no herd immunity exist, social distancing is the best mechanism available to protect patients and health care workers from infection.
32303077,This review will discuss what is known about the virus as it relates to pregnancy and then consider management considerations based on these data.
32303077,KEY POINTS: · COVID-19 severity in pregnancy is unclear..
32303077,· Social distancing is the best protective mechanism..
32303077,· No clear evidence of vertical transmission exists..
32303077,· Mother/baby separation avoids transmission..
32303365,Pneumonia caused by coronavirus, which originated in Wuhan, China, in late 2019, has been spread around the world already becoming a pandemic.
32303365,Unfortunately, there is not yet a specific vaccine or effective antiviral drug for treating COVID-19.
32303365,Many of these patients deteriorate rapidly and require intubation and are mechanically ventilated, which is causing the collapse of the health system in many countries due to lack of ventilators and intensive care beds.
32303365,In this document we review two simple adjuvant therapies to administer, without side effects, and low cost that could be useful for the treatment of acute severe coronavirus infection associated with acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
32303365,VitaminC, a potent antioxidant, has emerged as a relevant therapy due to its potential benefits when administered intravenous.
32303365,The potential effect of vitaminC in reducing inflammation in the lungs could play a key role in lung injury caused by coronavirus infection.
32303365,Another potential effective therapy is ozone: it has been extensively studied and used for many years and its effectiveness has been demonstrated so far in multiples studies.
32303365,Nevertheless, our goal is not to make an exhaustive review of these therapies but spread the beneficial effects themselves.
32303365,Obviously clinical trials are necessaries, but due to the potential benefit of these two therapies we highly recommended to add to the therapeutic arsenal.
32303420,Oral and maxillofacial surgery is correlated with a high risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
32303420,Therefore, the aim of the review is to collect and discuss aspects of the management of patients in oral and maxillofacial surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32303420,In order to save resources and to avoid unnecessary exposure to infected patients, there is the need to schedule interventions depending on their priority.
32303420,During the peak of the pandemic, no elective surgery should be performed.
32303420,Even urgent procedures might be postponed if there is a view to recovery of a COVID-19 patient within a few days.
32303420,Emergency procedures do not allow any delay.
32303420,Specialties with overlap in therapies should have well defined arrangements among each other concerning the treatment spectra in order to avoid redundancy and loss of resources.
32303420,Inpatient and outpatient units have to be organized in such a way that the risk of cross-infection among patients is reduced to a minimum.
32303420,Especially, testing of patients for SARS-CoV-2 is important to detect the infected patients at an early stage.
32303420,When surgery is performed on COVID-19 patients, adequate personal protective equipment is crucial.
32303420,There must be negative pressure in the operating room, and aerosol formation must be reduced to a minimum.
32303420,In order to address the COVID-19 challenge adequately, significant changes in the infrastructure of outpatient units, inpatient units, and operating rooms are needed.
32303420,In addition, the demands concerning personal protective equipment increase significantly.
32303420,The major aim is to protect patients as well as the medical staff from unnecessary infection, and to keep the healthcare system running effectively.
32303420,Therefore, every effort should be taken to make the necessary investments.
32303485,In the context of the current pandemic, there is a need for specific advice concerning treatment of patients with Head and Neck cancers.
32303485,The rule is to limit as much as possible the number of patients in order to reduce the risks of contamination by the SARS-Cov-2 virus for both patients and the caregivers, who are particularly exposed in ENT.
32303485,The aim is to minimize the risk of loss of opportunity for patients and to anticipate the increased number of cancer patients to be treated at the end of the pandemic, taking into account the degree of urgency, the difficulty of the surgery, the risk of contaminating the caregivers (tracheotomy) and the local situation (whether or not the hospital and intensive care departments are overstretched).
32303497,The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, causing the disease COVID-19, first emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and has now spread to 203 countries or territories, infected over 2 million people and caused over 133,000 deaths.
32303497,There is an urgent need for specific treatments.
32303497,One potential treatment is chloroquine and its derivatives, including hydroxychloroquine, which have both antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects.
32303497,These compounds are effective against SARS-CoV-2 <i>in vitro</i>, but <i>in vivo</i> data are lacking.
32303497,Although some encouraging outcomes have been reported, and these results have been received enthusiastically, we recommend careful and critical evaluation of current evidence only when all methods and data are available for peer review.
32303497,Chloroquine is safe and cheap.
32303497,However, further evidence from coordinated multicentre trials is required before it can be confidently said whether it is effective against the current pandemic.
32303509,<b/> Cytokine release and macrophage activation contribute to immunopathology after SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32303509,We discuss approaches to decrease the morbidity and mortality in patients with COVID-19 by repurposing existing drugs previously developed for cancer therapy.
32303607,The COVID-19 pandemic is putting unprecedented pressures on healthcare systems globally.
32303607,Early insights have been made possible by rapid sharing of data from China and Italy.
32303607,In the UK, we have rapidly mobilised inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) centres in order that preparations can be made to protect our patients and the clinical services they rely on.
32303607,This is a novel coronavirus; much is unknown as to how it will affect people with IBD.
32303607,We also lack information about the impact of different immunosuppressive medications.
32303607,To address this uncertainty, the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) COVID-19 IBD Working Group has used the best available data and expert opinion to generate a risk grid that groups patients into highest, moderate and lowest risk categories.
32303607,This grid allows patients to be instructed to follow the UK government's advice for shielding, stringent and standard advice regarding social distancing, respectively.
32303607,Further considerations are given to service provision, medical and surgical therapy, endoscopy, imaging and clinical trials.
32303609,The current coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing global health crisis due to covid-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.
32303609,Although covid-19 leads to little or mild flu-like symptoms in the majority of affected patients, the disease may cause severe, frequently lethal complications such as progressive pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome and organ failure driven by hyperinflammation and a cytokine storm syndrome.
32303609,This situation causes various major challenges for gastroenterology.
32303609,In the context of IBD, several key questions arise.
32303609,For instance, it is an important question to understand whether patients with IBD (eg, due to intestinal ACE2 expression) might be particularly susceptible to covid-19 and the cytokine release syndrome associated with lung injury and fatal outcomes.
32303609,Another highly relevant question is how to deal with immunosuppression and immunomodulation during the current pandemic in patients with IBD and whether immunosuppression affects the progress of covid-19.
32303609,Here, the current understanding of the pathophysiology of covid-19 is reviewed with special reference to immune cell activation.
32303609,Moreover, the potential implications of these new insights for immunomodulation and biological therapy in IBD are discussed.
32303672,We present the report of the first, to our best knowledge, case of COVID-19 in a tetraplegic person.
32303672,A 56-year-old male with AIS A C4 tetraplegia developed fever during the night, without any prodrome.
32303672,His general practitioner suspected a urinary tract infection and prescribed him antibiotic therapy.
32303672,After 2 days of antibiotic therapy the fever still persisted, so the individual was admitted to the local hospital and treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.
32303672,After 2 days he was transferred to our spinal unit.
32303672,Considering the worsening of the chest X-ray and fever despite 48 h of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, we strongly suspected viral pneumonia.
32303672,SARS-CoV-2 was detected and antiviral therapy with Lopinavir/Ritonavir, associated with hydroxychloroquine, was promptly started.
32303672,Fever ceased after 2 days of therapy.
32303672,Blood test and chest X-ray findings in this patient were similar to previously published findings regarding COVID-19.
32303672,One difference between this case and the known clinical course of COVID-19 is that did not develop cough.
32303672,Another interesting feature of our case is that, despite tetraplegia, the clinical course was not severe.
32303672,Persons with COVID-19 remain asymptomatic, these results underscore the need for rehabilitation and SCI professionals to have a high index of suspicion for COVID-19 in their inpatient and outpatient clients.
32303672,Only inpatient with fever hase being tested for COVID-19.
32303672,All new patients are submitted to SARS-COV-2 Test.
32303672,Moreover, routine testing of patients who have to participate in therapy in common gym areas may be warranted.
32303821,The current COVID-19 pandemic inherits an unprecedented challenge for the treating rheumatologists.
32303821,On the one hand, antirheumatic drugs can increase the risk of infection and potentially deteriorate the course of an infection.
32303821,On the other hand, an active inflammatory rheumatic disease can also increase the risk for an infection.
32303821,In the recommendations of the German Society for Rheumatology (www.dgrh.de), it is recommended that our patients continue the antirheumatic therapy to maintain remission or low state of activity despite the pandemic.
32303821,In this study, patients with inflammatory rheumatic disease were asked in the first weeks of the pandemic on their opinion of their immunomodulating therapy.
32303821,The result shows that over 90% of the patients followed the recommendation of the rheumatologist to continue the antirheumatic therapy, and only a small percentage of the patients terminated the therapy on their own.
32303821,This result was independent of the individual anti-rheumatic therapy.
32303821,Taken together, the results of this study illustrate not only the trustful patient-physician partnership in a threatening situation but also the high impact of state-of-the art recommendations by the respective scientific society.
32303885,SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is announced and it is very important to share our experience to the critical care community in the early stage.
32303885,Urgent intubation team was organized by anesthesiologists and was dispatched upon request.
32303885,We have retrospectively reviewed medical charts of 20 critically ill patients with Covid-19 pneumonia who required tracheal intubation from February 17 to March 19 in Wuhan No.1 hospital, China.
32303885,We collected their demographics, vital signs, blood gas analysis before and after tracheal intubation, and 7-day outcome after tracheal intubation.
32303885,Out of 20 patients, 90% were over 60 years old and 15 were with at least one comorbidity.
32303885,All meet the indication for tracheal intubation announced by treatment expert group.
32303885,We had successfully intubated all patients using personal protective equipment without circulatory collapse during tracheal intubation.
32303885,During the observational period, none of 17 anesthesiologists were infected.
32303885,Although intubation improved SPO<sub>2</sub>, reduced PaCO<sub>2</sub> and blood lactate, seven of 20 patients died within 7-days after tracheal intubation.
32303885,Non-survivors showed significantly lower SPO<sub>2</sub> and higher PaCO<sub>2</sub> and blood lactate compared to survivors.
32303885,For those who are anticipated to deteriorate severe pneumonia with poor prognosis, earlier respiratory support with tracheal intubation may be advised to improve outcome.
32303925,The emergence of the novel coronavirus disease known as COVID-19 creates another health burden for people living with HIV (PLWH) who face multiple morbidities and may be at heightened risk for severe physical health illness from COVID-19.
32303925,Our abilities to address these morbidities in PLWH must be considered alongside the socially-produced burdens that both place this population at risk for COVID-19 and heighten the likelihood of adverse outcomes.
32303925,These burdens can affect the physical, emotional, and social well-being of PLWH and interfere with the delivery of effective healthcare and access to HIV treatment.
32303925,We posit that a syndemic framework can be used to conceptualize the potential impact of COVID-19 among PLWH to inform the development of health programming services.
32304191,Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was firstly reported at the end of 2019.
32304191,The disease rapidly spread all around the world in a few months and was declared a worldwide pandemic by WHO in March 2020.
32304191,By April 9, there were 1,436,198 confirmed COVID-19 cases in the world, nearly with 6% mortality rate.
32304191,This novel infectious disease causes respiratory tract illness that may generally occur as mild upper respiratory tract disease or pneumonia.
32304191,In older patients and/or patients with underlying conditions, it may result in acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi organ failure and even death.
32304191,According to the current literature, children account approximately for 1%–5% of diagnosed COVID-19 cases.
32304191,Generally, COVID-19 seems to be a less severe disease for children than adults.
32304191,Approximately 90% of pediatric patients are diagnosed as asymptomatic, mild, or moderate disease.
32304191,However, up to 6.7% of cases may be severe.
32304191,Severe illness is generally seen in patients smaller than 1 year of age and patients who have underlying disesases.
32304191,The epidemiological and clinical patterns of COVID-19 and treatment approaches in pediatric patients still remain unclear although many pediatric reports are published.
32304191,This review aims to summarize the current epidemics, clinical presentations, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19 in pediatric patients.
32304192,Our first COVID-19 case in Turkey was a 44-year-old male who referred to the hospital on March 9, 2020.
32304192,The first related death occurred on March 17, 2020.
32304192,Preparedness for the pandemic has been ongoing before the first case was detected.
32304192,The National Pandemic Plan was published in 2006.
32304192,The Pandemic Influenza National Preparedness Plan was available after being updated in light of experiences gained during the 2009 Influenza A pandemic.
32304192,Accordingly, Pandemic Coordination Boards and Operation Centers have been established on the national and provincial levels.
32304192,This was an adaptable plan to the Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19).
32304192,We formed teams to work on a 24/7 basis and established a Scientific Committee at the Public Health Emergency Operation Center within the General Directorate of Public Health.
32304192,“COVID-19 Risk Assessment”, “COVID-19 Guideline” and “Case Report Form”, regulations of personal protective equipment along with need-based guidelines, treatment algorithms, brochures and related documents have been released.
32304192,For the case-based follow-up, Public Health Management System (HSYS) is being used.
32304192,PCR and rapid diagnostic kits are being used to analyze the samples at the central Microbiology Reference Laboratory and the authorized laboratories in several provinces.
32304192,Various preventive measures were implemented including flight restrictions to certain countries, gradually expanded to suspending all flights and prohibiting the entry of foreign nationals, 14-day isolation and symptom monitoring for those that came from countries under risk.
32304192,Persons with chronic diseases have been granted an administrative leave, on campus education at schools and activities of public rest and entertainment areas were temporarily suspended.
32304192,The measures have been implemented for penitentiary institutions, dormitories, nursing homes, public transport and intercity buses, and also weekend curfews are implemented.
32304192,In accordance with the pandemic plan, actions have been carried out with a multi-sectoral approach, and preventive measures have been implemented to cover the society as a whole.
32304276,Health services across the world face an unprecedented situation as a result of a global COVID-19 outbreak.
32304276,Urgent joined research efforts regarding the SARS-COV-2 rapid tests, accurate diagnosis, especially early recognition, and effective treatment of life-threatening complications would be highly desirable for humanity and medical workforce all over the world that try to combat a current global pandemic threat.
32304276,Due to indirect complex effect, intensified COVID-19 therapies and multi-drug treatment, it is believed that some oral conditions could be aggravated by COVID-19 disease, particularly those with autoimmune aetiology, linked to compromised immune system or long-term pharmacotherapy.
32304393,In this study, We report on the use of fluorine 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) scan examinations for detecting potential COVID-19 respiratory syndrome in asymptomatic left ventricular assist device (LVAD) recipients.
32304393,Thus, extreme caution and thoughtful approaches should be taken for a timely detection in delicate LVAD populations, especially if patients are living in a high-density COVID-19-infected area, and the potential intention for LVAD treatment is bridge to transplantation.
32304394,The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is infecting hundreds of thousands of humans around the globe.
32304394,The coronavirus disease COVID-19 is known to generate mild as well as critical courses.
32304394,Complications on the intensive care units include acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute cardiac- and kidney injury as well as shock.Here, we present the first case report of a successful treatment of a COVID-19 patient presenting with ARDS plus refractory combined cardiogenic and vasoplegic shock, which could be successfully stabilized after implantation of a percutaneous ventricular assist device (pVAD) plus an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
32304394,While such intense treatment might not be feasible in case of a health care disaster as described for the hot spots of the COVID-19 pandemic, it might encourage treatment of younger patients on intensive care units not overcrowded by critically ill patients.
32304395,The outbreak of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes the respiratory illness COVID-19 has led to unprecedented efforts at containment due to its rapid community spread, associated mortality, and lack of immunization and treatment.
32304395,We herein detail a case of a young patient who suffered life-threatening disease and multiorgan failure.
32304395,His clinical course involved rapid and profound respiratory decompensation such that he required support with venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO).
32304395,He also demonstrated hyperinflammation (C-reactive protein peak 444.6 mg/L) with severe cytokine elevation (Interleukin-6 peak &gt; 3000 pg/ml).
32304395,Through treatment targeting hyperinflammation, he recovered from critical COVID-19 respiratory failure and required only 160 hours of VV-ECMO support.
32304395,He was extubated 4 days after decannulation, had progressive renal recovery, and was discharged to home on hospital day 24.
32304395,Of note, repeat SARS-CoV-2 test was negative 21 days after his first positive test.
32304395,We present one of the first successful cases of VV-ECMO support to recovery of COVID-19 respiratory failure in North America.
32304402,To assess the clinical severity of COVID-19 pneumonia using qualitative and/or quantitative chest CT indicators and identify the CT characteristics of critical cases.
32304402,Fifty-one patients with COVID-19 pneumonia including ordinary cases (group A, n=12), severe cases(group B, n=15) and critical cases (group C, n=24) were retrospectively enrolled.
32304402,The qualitative and quantitative indicators from chest CT were recorded and compared using Fisher's exact test, one-way ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis H test and receiver operating characteristic analysis.
32304402,Depending on the severity of the disease, the number of involved lung segments and lobes, the frequencies of consolidation, crazy-paving pattern and air bronchogram increased in more severe cases.
32304402,Qualitative indicators including total severity score for the whole lung and total score for crazy-paving and consolidation could distinguish groups B and C from A(69% sensitivity, 83% specificity and 73% accuracy) but were similar between group B and group C.
32304402,Combined qualitative and quantitative indicators could distinguish these three groups with high sensitivity(B+C vs.
32304402,A, 90%; C vs.
32304402,B, 92%), specificity(100%, 87%) and accuracy(92%, 90%).
32304402,Critical cases had higher total severity score(&gt;10) and higher total score for crazy-paving and consolidation(&gt;4) than ordinary cases, and had higher mean lung density(&gt;-779HU) and full width at half maximum(&gt;128HU) but lower relative volume of normal lung density(≦50%) than ordinary/severe cases.
32304402,In our critical cases, eight patients with relative volume of normal lung density smaller than 40% received mechanical ventilation for supportive treatment, and two of them had died.
32304402,A rapid, accurate severity assessment of COVID-19 pneumonia based on chest CT would be feasible and could provide help for making management decisions, especially for the critical cases.
32304435,In December 2019, a novel coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32304435,Severe complications have been reported to occur in 33% of patients with COVID-19 and include acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute renal failure, acute respiratory injury, septic shock, and severe pneumonia.
32304435,Currently, there is no specific treatment or approved vaccine against COVID-19 and many clinical trials are currently investigating potential medications to treat COVID-19.
32304435,The immunosuppressed status of some cancer patients (whether caused by the disease itself or the treatment) increases their risk of infection compared with the general population.
32304435,This short review aims to focus on the impact of COVID-19 on a cancer patient and discuss management options and recommendation in addition to highlighting the currently available clinical guidelines and resources.
32304488,COVID-19 is a novel infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory distress (SARS)-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32304488,Several therapeutic options are currently emerging but none with universal consensus or proven efficacy.
32304488,Solid organ transplant recipients are perceived to be at increased risk of severe COVID-19 because of their immunosuppressed conditions due to chronic use of immunosuppressive drugs (ISDs).
32304488,It is therefore likely that solid organ transplant recipients will be treated with these experimental antivirals.
32304488,This article is not intended to provide a systematic literature review on investigational treatments tested against COVID-19; rather, the authors aim to provide recommendations for therapeutic drug monitoring of ISDs in transplant recipients infected with SARS-CoV-2 based on a review of existing data in the literature.
32304488,Management of drug-drug interactions between investigational anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs and immunosuppressants is a complex task for the clinician.
32304488,Adequate immunosuppression is necessary to prevent graft rejection while, if critically ill, the patient may benefit from pharmacotherapeutic interventions directed at limiting SARS-CoV-2 viral replication.
32304488,Maintaining ISD concentrations within the desired therapeutic range requires a highly individualized approach that is complicated by the pandemic context and lack of hindsight.
32304488,With this article, the authors inform the clinician about the potential interactions of experimental COVID-19 treatments with ISDs used in transplantation.
32304488,Recommendations regarding therapeutic drug monitoring and dose adjustments in the context of COVID-19 are provided.
32304577,Emerging evidence shows that severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can be complicated with coagulopathy, namely disseminated intravascular coagulation, which has a rather prothrombotic character with high risk of venous thromboembolism.
32304577,The incidence of venous thromboembolism among COVID-19 patients in intensive care units appears to be somewhat higher compared to that reported in other studies including such patients with other disease conditions.
32304577,D-dimer might help in early recognition of these high-risk patients and also predict outcome.
32304577,Preliminary data show that in patients with severe COVID-19, anticoagulant therapy appears to be associated with lower mortality in the subpopulation meeting sepsis-induced coagulopathy criteria or with markedly elevated d-dimer.
32304577,Recent recommendations suggest that all hospitalized COVID-19 patients should receive thromboprophylaxis, or full therapeutic-intensity anticoagulation if such an indication is present.
32304612,With the current outbreak and spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) worldwide many questions arise.
32304612,There have been issued precautions regarding the use of anti-inflammatory medications, including aspirin.
32304612,To our knowledge, there is insufficient data to suggest an increased risk between prophylactic use of low-dose aspirin and progression of COVID-19 infection in pregnant women at risk of placental complications.

32304643,On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
32304643,Health care systems worldwide should be prepared for an unusually high volume of patients in the next few weeks to months.
32304643,Even the most efficient radiology department will undergo tremendous stress when victims of a mass casualty flood the emergency department and in turn the radiology department.
32304643,A significant increase is expected in the number of imaging studies ordered for the initial diagnosis and treatment follow-up of cases of COVID-19.
32304643,Here, we highlight recommendations for developing and implementing a mass casualty incident (MCI) plan for a viral outbreak, such as the current COVID-19 infection.
32304643,The MCI plan consists of several steps, including preparation, mobilization of resources, imaging chain, adjusting imaging protocols, and education, such as MCI plan simulation and in-service training.
32304643,Having an MCI plan in place for a viral outbreak will protect patients and staff and ultimately decrease virus transmission.
32304643,The use of simulations will help identify throughput and logistical issues.
32304747,Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs) exhibit major pleiotropic protecting effects beyond their antihypertensive properties, including reduction of inflammation.
32304747,ARBs directly protect the lung from the severe acute respiratory syndrome as a result of viral infections, including those from coronavirus.
32304747,The protective effect of ACE2 is enhanced by ARB administration.
32304747,For these reasons ARB therapy must be continued for patients affected by hypertension, diabetes and renal disease, comorbidities of the current COVID-19 pandemic.
32304747,Controlled clinical studies should be conducted to determine whether ARBs may be included as additional therapy for COVID-19 patients.
32304772,The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global health emergency.
32304772,The cumulative number of new confirmed cases and deaths are still increasing out of China.
32304772,Independent predicted factors associated with fatal outcomes remain uncertain.
32304772,The goal of the current study was to investigate the potential risk factors associated with fatal outcomes from COVID-19 through a multivariate Cox regression analysis and a nomogram model.
32304772,A retrospective cohort of 1,590 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 throughout China was established.
32304772,The prognostic effects of variables, including clinical features and laboratory findings, were analyzed by using Kaplan-Meier methods and a Cox proportional hazards model.
32304772,A prognostic nomogram was formulated to predict the survival of patients with COVID-19.
32304772,In this nationwide cohort, nonsurvivors included a higher incidence of elderly people and subjects with coexisting chronic illness, dyspnea, and laboratory abnormalities on admission compared with survivors.
32304772,Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that age ≥ 75 years (hazard ratio [HR], 7.86; 95% CI, 2.44-25.35), age between 65 and 74 years (HR, 3.43; 95% CI, 1.24-9.5), coronary heart disease (HR, 4.28; 95% CI, 1.14-16.13), cerebrovascular disease (HR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.07-8.94), dyspnea (HR, 3.96; 95% CI, 1.42-11), procalcitonin level &gt; 0.5 ng/mL (HR, 8.72; 95% CI, 3.42-22.28), and aspartate aminotransferase level &gt; 40 U/L (HR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.1-6.73) were independent risk factors associated with fatal outcome.
32304772,A nomogram was established based on the results of multivariate analysis.
32304772,The internal bootstrap resampling approach suggested the nomogram has sufficient discriminatory power with a C-index of 0.91 (95% CI, 0.85-0.97).
32304772,The calibration plots also showed good consistency between the prediction and the observation.
32304772,The proposed nomogram accurately predicted clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19 based on individual characteristics.
32304772,Earlier identification, more intensive surveillance, and appropriate therapy should be considered in patients at high risk.
32304822,This is a brief report of 4 paediatric cases of COVID-19 infection in Malaysia BACKGROUND: COVID-19, a coronavirus, first detected in Wuhan, China has now spread rapidly to over 60 countries and territories around the world, infecting more than 85000 individuals.
32304822,As the case count amongst children is low, there is need to report COVID-19 in children to better understand the virus and the disease.
32304822,In Malaysia, until end of February 2020, there were four COVID-19 paediatric cases with ages ranging from 20 months to 11 years.
32304822,All four cases were likely to have contracted the virus in China.
32304822,The children had no symptoms or mild flu-like illness.
32304822,The cases were managed symptomatically.
32304822,None required antiviral therapy.
32304822,There were 2 major issues regarding the care of infected children.
32304822,Firstly, the quarantine of an infected child with a parent who tested negative was an ethical dilemma.
32304822,Secondly, oropharyngeal and nasal swabs in children were at risk of false negative results.
32304822,These issues have implications for infection control.
32304822,Consequently, there is a need for clearer guidelines for child quarantine and testing methods in the management of COVID-19 in children.
32304834,During the unprecedented times caused by the novel coronavirus disease 2019, there is rapidly evolving information and guidance.
32304834,However, a focus must also be on proper and effective risk communication.
32304834,This is especially the case during pandemics that have high rates of infection, significant morbidity, lack of therapeutic measures, and rapid increases in cases, all of which apply to the current coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.
32304834,A consequence of poor risk communication and heightened risk perception is hoarding behavior, which can lead to lack of medications and personal protective equipment.
32304834,One potential way to ensure appropriate risk communication is using social media channels, and ensuring an ongoing consistent media presence.
32304834,Another important step is to include all stakeholders including members of the allergy community in broader public health messaging.
32304834,As we continue to face unprecedented times in the allergy community, an understanding and appreciation of risk communication will be essential as we communicate with, and inform, our patients, and our colleagues, moving forward.
32304970,Coronavirus (COVID-19) is highly infectious agent that causes fatal respiratory illnesses, which is of great global public health concern.
32304970,Currently, there is no effective vaccine for tackling this COVID19 pandemic where disease countermeasures rely upon preventing or slowing person-to-person transmission.
32304970,Specifically, there is increasing efforts to prevent or reduce transmission to front-line healthcare workers (HCW).
32304970,However, there is growing international concern regarding the shortage in supply chain of critical one-time-use personal and protective equipment (PPE).
32304970,PPE are heat sensitive and are not, by their manufacturer's design, intended for reprocessing.
32304970,Most conventional sterilization technologies used in hospitals, or in terminal medical device sterilization providers, cannot effectively reprocess PPE due to the nature and severity of sterilization modalities.
32304970,Contingency planning for PPE stock shortage is important.
32304970,Solutions in the Republic of Ireland include use of smart communication channels to improve supply chain, bespoke production of PPE to meets gaps, along with least preferred option, use of sterilization or high-level disinfection for PPE reprocessing.
32304970,Reprocessing PPE must consider material composition, functionality post treatment, along with appropriate disinfection.
32304970,Following original manufacturer of PPE and regulatory guidance is important.
32304970,Technologies deployed in the US, and for deployment in the Republic of Ireland, are eco-friendly, namely vaporised hydrogen peroxide (VH2O2), such as for filtering facepiece respirators and UV irradiation and High-level liquid disinfection (Actichlor+) is also been pursed in Ireland.
32304970,Safeguarding supply chain of PPE will sustain vital healthcare provision and will help reduce mortality.
32305025,Since December 2019, a new outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan (Hubei, China) and rapidly spread throughout China, however, confirmed cases are still increasing worldwide.
32305025,To investigate the epidemiological history and initial clinical characteristics of 10 patients with family aggregation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in Western Chongqing, China.
32305025,Ten patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection by real time Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR), were collected from The People's Hospital of Dazu District, Chongqing.
32305025,Epidemiological data and laboratory and imaging results were collected on the first day of admission, and analyzed based on the Diagnosis and Treatment Guideline for COVID-19 (5th edition, China).
32305025,Of the 10 cases, case A had a history of a temporary stay in Wuhan and transmitted the virus to the others through family gathering, living together, and sharing vehicles.
32305025,The average age was 56.5 years (± 11.16), six patients were males, and the incubation period was 2-14 days.
32305025,Dry cough was the main symptom, followed by fever and fatigue.
32305025,Most patients were clinically classified as ordinary-type, with three cases being severe-type.
32305025,Chest computed tomography results were nonspecific, mainly with ground-glass attenuation and/or shadow images.
32305025,Extensive lesion distribution was seen in severe cases.
32305025,CD4+ lymphocyte counts were 61, 180, and 348 cells/uL in severe-type patients, respectively.
32305025,Notably, viral nucleic acid values in nasopharyngeal swabs were lower (19, 25, and 26) than those of ordinary-type patients, suggesting a higher viral load.
32305025,Neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was also higher in severe-type patients CONCLUSIONS: Initial examination results of lower CD4+ lymphocyte counts and RT-PCR-CT values coupled with higher NLR may indicate the severity of COVID-19 infection for these family clusters.
32305181,The COVID-19 pandemics is posing unprecedented challenges and threats to patients and healthcare systems worldwide.
32305181,Acute respiratory complications that require intensive care unit (ICU) management are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients.
32305181,Patients with worst outcomes and higher mortality are reported to include immunocompromised subjects, namely older adults and polymorbid individuals and malnourished people in general.
32305181,ICU stay, polymorbidity and older age are all commonly associated with high risk for malnutrition, representing per se a relevant risk factor for higher morbidity and mortality in chronic and acute disease.
32305181,Also importantly, prolonged ICU stays are reported to be required for COVID-19 patients stabilization, and longer ICU stay may per se directly worsen or cause malnutrition, with severe loss of skeletal muscle mass and function which may lead to disability, poor quality of life and additional morbidity.
32305181,Prevention, diagnosis and treatment of malnutrition should therefore be routinely included in the management of COVID-19 patients.
32305181,In the current document, the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) aims at providing concise guidance for nutritional management of COVID-19 patients by proposing 10 practical recommendations.
32305181,The practical guidance is focused to those in the ICU setting or in the presence of older age and polymorbidity, which are independently associated with malnutrition and its negative impact on patient survival.
32305359,The coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic poses a significant risk to patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) or cellular therapy.
32305359,The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy Pharmacy Special Interest Group Steering Committee aims to provide pharmacy practice management recommendations for how to transition clinical HCT or cellular therapy pharmacy services using telemedicine capabilities in the inpatient and outpatient settings to maintain an equivalent level of clinical practice while minimizing viral spread in a high-risk, immunocompromised population.
32305359,In addition, the Steering Committee offers clinical management recommendations for COVID-19 in HCT and cellular therapy recipients based on the rapidly developing literature.
32305359,As the therapeutic and supportive care interventions for COVID-19 expand, collaboration with clinical pharmacy providers is critical to ensure safe administration in HCT recipients.
32305359,Attention to drug-drug interactions (DDIs) and toxicity, particularly QTc prolongation, warrants close cardiac monitoring and potential cessation of concomitant QTc-prolonging agents.
32305359,Expanded indications for hydroxychloroquine and tocilizumab have already caused stress on the usual supply chain.
32305359,Detailed prescribing algorithms, decision pathways, and specific patient population stock may be necessary.
32305359,The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged all members of the healthcare team, and we must continue to remain vigilant in providing pharmacy clinical services to one of the most high-risk patient populations while also remaining committed to providing compassionate and safe care for patients undergoing HCT and cellular therapies.
32305401,SARS-CoV2 host cell infection is mediated by the binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
32305401,Systemic dysregulation observed in SARS-CoV was previously postulated to be due to ACE2/Ang1-7/Mas axis downregulation, increased ACE2 activity was shown to mediate disease protection.
32305401,Since angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), ACE inhibitors, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) increase ACE2 receptor expression, it has been tacitly believed that the use of these agents may facilitate viral disease, thus they should not be used in high-risk patients with cardiovascular disease.
32305401,Based on the anti-inflammatory benefits of the upregulation of the ACE2/Ang1-7/Mas axis and previously demonstrated benefits of lung function improvement in SARS-CoV infections, we hypothesize that the benefits of treatment with renin-angiotensin system inhibitors in SARS-COV2 may outweigh the risks and at the very least should not be withheld.
32305506,Significant aspects of COVID-19 pandemic remain obscure.
32305506,Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a component of the renin-angiotensin system, whose expression dominates on lung alveolar epithelial cells, is the human cell receptor of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19.
32305506,We strongly encourage the concept that thorough considerations of receptor-ligand interactions should be kept at the heart of scientific debate on infection.
32305506,In this idea, the whole renin-angiotensin system has to be evaluated.
32305506,We hypothesize that factors related to ethnicity, environment, behaviors, associated illness, and medications involving this complex system are probably responsible for situations regarded as anomalous from both an epidemiological and a clinical point of view, but, taken together, such factors may explain most of the aspects of current outbreak.
32305506,We decided to use the analogy of a play and speculate about the possible impact in this tragedy of 1) air pollution via the interference of nitrogen dioxide on ACE2 expression; 2) the dual role of nicotine; 3) the hypothetical involvement of ACE2 polymorphisms, the relationships of which with ethnic factors and susceptibility to cardiovascular disease seems intriguing; 4) the impact on the severity of infection of hypertension and related medications acting on the renin/angiotensin system, and, finally, 5) the possible helpful role of chloroquine, thanks to its capacity of modifying ACE2 affinity to the viral spike protein by altering glycosylation.
32305506,This hypothesis paper is an urgent call for the development of research programs that aim at questioning whether the putative protagonists of this tragedy are real-life actors in COVID-19.
32305585,A markedly increased demand for vascular ultrasound laboratory and other imaging studies in COVID-19-positive patients has occurred, due to most of these patients having a markedly elevated D-dimer and a presumed prothrombotic state in many of the very ill patients.
32305585,In the present report, we have summarized a broad institutional consensus focusing on evaluation and recommended empirical therapy for COVID-19-positive patients.
32305585,We recommend following the algorithms with the idea that as more data becomes available these algorithms may well change.
32305587,In the context of the ongoing global outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), management of exposure events is a concern.
32305587,Long-term care hospitals (LTCHs) are particularly vulnerable to cluster outbreaks because facilities for patient isolation and healthcare personnel to care for these patients in isolation are difficult to arrange in a large outbreak situation.
32305587,Although several drugs have been proposed as treatment options, there are no data on the effectiveness and safety of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for COVID-19.
32305587,After a large COVID-19 exposure event in an LTCH in Korea, PEP using hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) was administered to 211 individuals, including 189 patients and 22 careworkers, whose baseline polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for COVID-19 were negative.
32305587,PEP was completed in 184 (97.4%) patients and 21 (95.5%) careworkers without serious adverse events.
32305587,At the end of 14 days of quarantine, all follow-up PCR tests were negative.
32305587,Based on our experience, further clinical studies are recommended for COVID-19 PEP.
32305589,Despite advances in Drug Discovery, the viral infections always remain the major challenge for the Scientists across the globe.
32305589,The recent pandemic COVID-19 viral infection has created a disastrous situation all over the world.
32305589,As no drug is available to treat such life- threatening disease and the mortality rate is significantly increased due to COVID-19; there is an utmost need to cure the infection by Drug Repurposing.
32305589,Some counties are against the use of these drugs because of adverse effects associated with drug repurposing and lack of statistically significant clinical data but they were found to be effective in some countries to treat affected COVID-19 patients (Off label/ Investigational).
32305589,The article emphases the possible drug candidates in the treatment of COVID-19 infection.
32305589,Most of these drugs were found to be effective in in vitro studies.
32305589,There is a need to reassess the in vitro data and to carry out randomised clinical trials.
32305589,Further investigations of these drugs are recommended on the priority basis.
32305831,Since the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic, it is known that the severe course of the disease occurs mostly among the elderly, whereas it is rare among children and young adults.
32305831,Comorbidities, in particular, diabetes and hypertension, clearly associated with age, besides obesity and smoke, are strongly associated with the need for intensive treatment and a dismal outcome.
32305831,A weaker immunity of the elderly has been proposed as a possible explanation of this uneven age distribution.
32305831,Thus, there is concern that children treated for cancer may allso be at risk for an unfavourable course of infection.
32305831,Along the same line, anecdotal information from Wuhan, China, mentioned a severe course of COVID-19 in a child treated for leukaemia.
32305831,We made a flash survey on COVID-19 incidence and severity among children on anticancer treatment.
32305831,Respondents were asked by email to fill in a short Web-based survey.
32305831,We received reports from 25 countries, where approximately 10,000 patients at risk are followed up.
32305831,At the time of the survey, more than 200 of these children were tested, nine of whom were positive for COVID-19.
32305831,Eight of the nine cases had asymptomatic to mild disease, and one was just diagnosed with COVID-19.
32305831,We also discuss preventive measures that are in place or should be taken and treatment options in immunocompromised children with COVID-19.
32305831,Thus, even children receiving anticancer chemotherapy may have a mild or asymptomatic course of COVID-19.
32305831,While we should not underestimate the risk of developing a more severe course of COVID-19 than that observed here, the intensity of preventive measures should not cause delays or obstructions in oncological treatment.
32305989,We provide our recommendations (not evidence based) for managing multiple myeloma patients during the pandemic of COVID-19.
32305989,We do not recommend therapy for smoldering myeloma patients (standard or high risk).
32305989,Screening for COVID-19 should be done in all patients before therapy.
32305989,For standard-risk patients, we recommend the following: ixazomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (IRd) (preferred), cyclophosphamide lenalidomide and dexamethasone (CRd), daratumumab lenalidomide and dexamethasone (DRd), lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone (RVd), or cyclophosphamide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone (CyBorD).
32305989,For high-risk patients we recommend carfilzomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (KRd) (preferred) or RVd.
32305989,Decreasing the dose of dexamethasone to 20 mg and giving bortezomib subcutaneously once a week is recommended.
32305989,We recommend delaying autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT), unless the patient has high-risk disease that is not responding well, or if the patient has plasma cell leukemia (PCL).
32305989,Testing for COVID-19 should be done before ASCT.
32305989,If a patient achieves a very good partial response or better, doses and frequency of drug administration can be modified.
32305989,After 10-12 cycles, lenalidomide maintenance is recommended for standard-risk patients and bortezomib or ixazomib are recommended for high-risk patients.
32305989,Daratumumab-based regimens are recommended for relapsed patients.
32305989,Routine ASCT is not recommended for relapse during the epidemic unless the patient has an aggressive relapse or secondary PCL.
32305989,Patients on current maintenance should continue their therapy.
32306015,To analyze how governments, hospitals and information technology(IT) companies use Internet technology to provide online health services during the early stage of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic in January 2020 in China, and then provide suggestions and coping strategies for the later stage and post-epidemic time.
32306015,We searched for information on ehealth services related to the outbreak of COVID-19 in China.
32306015,The sources of information were mainstream search engines such as Baidu and the popular interactive social platforms such as Webchat.
32306015,The keywords were &quot;Internet+pneumonia&quot;, &quot;Internet clinic&quot;, &quot;pneumonia online clinic&quot; and so on.
32306015,The time of information was from January 20 to February 3, 2020.
32306015,The key information was extracted and encoded by two persons back-to-back.
32306015,The coding information included: name of organization provider, launching time, location of provider, service items, user, health workers engaging in the service, and so on.
32306015,The coded information was entered and analyzed with SPSS 24.0 and Excel.
32306015,There were totally 57 projects launched by local governments, hospitals and IT companies.
32306015,Most of them were launched from January 24th to 27th, the hospital and government projects services regionally, especially in eastern provinces.
32306015,In this study, 90.48% of the enterprises and 100.00% of the hospitals had online fever clinic and consultation services for COVID-19, 66.67% of the enterprises and 37.04% of the hospitals serviced derivative health problems.
32306015,Only a few projects provided tele-medical consultation.
32306015,There were individual projects that provided online health management for home quarantine people.
32306015,Physicians were the main force of various projects.
32306015,In some hospital projects, there were also nurses, pharmacists and professional technicians to provide featured consultation.
32306015,Ehealth is useful and helpful for the health care system to rapidly cope with health demand during instantaneous and post epidemic time.
32306015,Regional distribution of ehealth is unbalanced.
32306015,There are institutional and technical feasibilities for the emergency application of Internet technology.
32306015,However, community health centers seldom provide ehealth or connect with tertiary hospitals with Internet.
32306015,Therefore, all kinds of providers within healthcare system should promote emergence ehealth.
32306015,Tele-medical diagnosis and referral should be developed by local governments during COVID-19.
32306015,The application of &quot;Internet+medical treatment&quot; in community medical institutions and synergy among various institutions should be promoted.
32306118,Otorhinolaryngological manifestations are common symptoms of COVID-19.
32306118,This study provides a brief and precise review of the current knowledge regarding COVID-19, including disease transmission, clinical characteristics, diagnosis, and potential treatment.
32306118,The article focused on COVID-19-related information useful in otolaryngologist practice.
32306118,The Medline and Web of Science databases were searched without a time limit using terms &quot;COVID-19&quot;, &quot;SARS-CoV-2&quot; in conjunction with &quot;otorhinolaryngological manifestation&quot;, &quot;ENT&quot;, and &quot;olfaction&quot;.
32306118,The most common otolaryngological dysfunctions of COVID-19 were cough, sore throat, and dyspnea.
32306118,Rhinorrhea, nasal congestion and dizziness were also present.
32306118,COVID-19 could manifest as an isolated sudden hyposmia/anosmia.
32306118,Upper respiratory tract (URT) symptoms were commonly observed in younger patients and usually appeared initially.
32306118,They could be present even before the molecular confirmation of SARS-CoV-2.
32306118,Otolaryngologists are of great risk of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 as they cope with URT.
32306118,ENT surgeons could be easily infected by SARS-CoV-2 during performing surgery in COVID-19 patients.
32306118,Ear, nose and throat (ENT) symptoms may precede the development of severe COVID-19.
32306118,During COVID-19 pandemic, patients with cough, sore throat, dyspnea, hyposmia/anosmia and a history of travel to the region with confirmed COVID-19 patients, should be considered as potential COVID-19 cases.
32306118,An otolaryngologist should wear FFP3/N95 mask, glasses, disposable and fluid resistant gloves and gown while examining such individuals.
32306118,Not urgent ENT surgeries should be postponed.
32306118,Additional studies analyzing why some patients develop ENT symptoms during COVID-19 and others do not are needed.
32306118,Further research is needed to determine the mechanism leading to anosmia.
32306408,To assess the capacity of intensive care units (ICUs) in Australia to respond to the expected increase in demand associated with COVID-19.
32306408,Analysis of Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society (ANZICS) registry data, supplemented by an ICU surge capability survey and veterinary facilities survey (both March 2020).
32306408,All Australian ICUs and veterinary facilities.
32306408,Baseline numbers of ICU beds, ventilators, dialysis machines, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation machines, intravenous infusion pumps, and staff (senior medical staff, registered nurses); incremental capability to increase capacity (surge) by increasing ICU bed numbers; ventilator-to-bed ratios; number of ventilators in veterinary facilities.
32306408,The 191 ICUs in Australia provide 2378 intensive care beds during baseline activity (9.3 ICU beds per 100 000 population).
32306408,Of the 175 ICUs that responded to the surge survey (with 2228 intensive care beds), a maximal surge would add an additional 4258 intensive care beds (191% increase) and 2631 invasive ventilators (120% increase).
32306408,This surge would require additional staffing of as many as 4092 senior doctors (245% increase over baseline) and 42 720 registered ICU nurses (269% increase over baseline).
32306408,An additional 188 ventilators are available in veterinary facilities, including 179 human model ventilators.
32306408,The directors of Australian ICUs report that intensive care bed capacity could be near tripled in response to the expected increase in demand caused by COVID-19.
32306408,But maximal surge in bed numbers could be hampered by a shortfall in invasive ventilators and would also require a large increase in clinician and nursing staff numbers.
32306491,Respiratory complications have been well remarked in the novel coronavirus disease (SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19), yet an emerging body of research indicates that cardiac involvement may be implicated in poor outcomes for these patients.
32306491,This review seeks to gather and distill the existing body of literature that describes the cardiac implications of COVID-19.
32306491,The English literature was reviewed for papers dealing with the cardiac effects of COVID-19.
32306491,Notably, COVID-19 patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease are counted in greater frequency in intensive care unit settings, and ultimately suffer greater rates of mortality.
32306491,Other studies have noted cardiac presentations for COVID-19, rather than respiratory, such as acute pericarditis and left ventricular dysfunction.
32306491,In some patients there has been evidence of acute myocardial injury, with correspondingly increased serum troponin I levels.
32306491,With regard to surgical interventions, there is a dearth of data describing myocardial protection during cardiac surgery for COVID-19 patients.
32306491,Although some insights have been garnered in the study of cardiovascular diseases for these patients, these insights remain fragmented and have yet to cement clear guidelines for actionable clinical practice.
32306491,While some information is available, further studies are imperative for a more cohesive understanding of the cardiac pathophysiology in COVID-19 patients to promote more informed treatment and, ultimately, better clinical outcomes.
32306500,Pre-clinical responses to fast-moving infectious disease outbreaks heavily depend on choosing the best isolates for animal models that inform diagnostics, vaccines and treatments.
32306500,Current approaches are driven by practical considerations (e.g. first available virus isolate) rather than a detailed analysis of the characteristics of the virus strain chosen, which can lead to animal models that are not representative of the circulating or emerging clusters.
32306500,Here, we suggest a combination of epidemiological, experimental and bioinformatic considerations when choosing virus strains for animal model generation.
32306500,We discuss the currently chosen SARS-CoV-2 strains for international coronavirus disease (COVID-19) models in the context of their phylogeny as well as in a novel alignment-free bioinformatic approach.
32306500,Unlike phylogenetic trees, which focus on individual shared mutations, this new approach assesses genome-wide co-developing functionalities and hence offers a more fluid view of the 'cloud of variances' that RNA viruses are prone to accumulate.
32306500,This joint approach concludes that while the current animal models cover the existing viral strains adequately, there is substantial evolutionary activity that is likely not considered by the current models.
32306500,Based on insights from the non-discrete alignment-free approach and experimental observations, we suggest isolates for future animal models.
32306513,Psychomotor delay and intellectual disability are potential limitations in psoriasis management, due to low compliance, and strict dependence from caregivers intervention.
32306513,We report our successful experience with a 58-year-old woman, who was genetically affected by Cornelia De Lange syndrome, which causes intellectual disability and psychomotor disorders.
32306513,The patient had been already treated with topical and traditional therapies, without any clinical benefits.
32306513,Eventually, she adhered to guselkumab treatment.
32306513,The compliance was excellent, significant improvements were observed after only 3 months of treatment, without adverse effects.
32306513,During follow-up, the COVID-19 pandemic address concern on the possible increased risk of infection due to immunosuppression.
32306513,In agreement with current Italian recommendations, risk and benefits profile was discussed with the patient's legal tutor and the decision to continue the treatment was taken.
32306513,Psoriasis complete clarification was maintained during the most difficult period of the Italian outbreak, allowing the patient to remain safely at home.

32307014,Since December 2019, a novel type of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan led to an outbreak throughout China and the rest of the world.
32307014,To date, there have been more than 1,260,000 COVID-19 patients, with a mortality rate of approximately 5.44%.
32307014,Studies have shown that coagulation dysfunction is a major cause of death in patients with severe COVID-19.
32307014,Therefore, the People's Liberation Army Professional Committee of Critical Care Medicine and Chinese Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis grouped experts from the frontline of the Wuhan epidemic to come together and develop an expert consensus on diagnosis and treatment of coagulation dysfunction associated with a severe COVID-19 infection.
32307014,This consensus includes an overview of COVID-19-related coagulation dysfunction, tests for coagulation, anticoagulation therapy, replacement therapy, supportive therapy and prevention.
32307014,The consensus produced 18 recommendations which are being used to guide clinical work.
32307151,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory tract infection caused by a newly emergent coronavirus, that was first recognized in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.
32307151,Currently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has defined the infection as a global pandemic and there is a health and social emergency for the management of this new infection.
32307151,While most people with COVID-19 develop only mild or uncomplicated illness, approximately 14% develop severe disease that requires hospitalization and oxygen support, and 5% require admission to an intensive care unit.
32307151,In severe cases, COVID-19 can be complicated by the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and septic shock, and multiorgan failure.
32307151,This consensus document has been prepared on evidence-informed guidelines developed by a multidisciplinary panel of health care providers from four Spanish scientific societies (Spanish Society of Intensive Care Medicine [SEMICYUC], Spanish Society of Pulmonologists [SEPAR], Spanish Society of Emergency [SEMES], Spanish Society of Anesthesiology, Reanimation, and Pain [SEDAR]) with experience in the clinical management of patients with COVID-19 and other viral infections, including SARS, as well as sepsis and ARDS.
32307151,The document provides clinical recommendations for the noninvasive respiratory support (noninvasive ventilation, high flow oxygen therapy with nasal cannula) in any patient with suspected or confirmed presentation of COVID-19 with acute respiratory failure.
32307151,This consensus guidance should serve as a foundation for optimized supportive care to ensure the best possible chance for survival and to allow for reliable comparison of investigational therapeutic interventions as part of randomized controlled trials.
32307215,The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to an unprecedented emergency scenario for all aspects of health care, including urology.
32307215,At the time of writing, Italy was the country with the highest rates of both infection and mortality.
32307215,A panel of experts recently released recommendations for prioritising urologic surgeries in a low-resource setting.
32307215,Of note, major cancer surgery represents a compelling challenge.
32307215,However, the burden of these procedures and the impact of such recommendations on urologic practice are currently unknown.
32307215,To fill this gap, we assessed the yearly proportion of high-priority major uro-oncologic surgeries at three Italian high-volume academic centres.
32307215,Of 2387 major cancer surgeries, 32.3% were classified as high priority (12.6% of radical nephroureterectomy, 17.3% of nephrectomy, 33.9% of radical prostatectomy, and 36.2% of radical cystectomy cases).
32307215,Moreover, 26.4% of high-priority major cancer surgeries were performed in patients at higher perioperative risk (American Society of Anesthesiologists score ≥3), with radical cystectomy contributing the most to this cohort (50%).
32307215,Our real-life data contextualise ongoing recommendations on prioritisation strategies during the current COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting the need for better patient selection for surgery.
32307215,We found that approximately two-thirds of elective major uro-oncologic surgeries can be safely postponed or changed to another treatment modality when the availability of health care resources is reduced.
32307215,PATIENT SUMMARY: We used data from three high-volume Italian academic urology centres to evaluate how many surgeries performed for prostate, bladder, kidney, and upper tract urothelial cancer can be postponed in times of emergency.
32307215,We found that approximately two-thirds of patients with these cancers do not require high-priority surgery.
32307215,Conversely, of patients requiring high-priority surgery, approximately one in four is considered at high perioperative risk.
32307215,These patients may pose challenges in allocation of resources in critical scenarios such as the current COVID-19 pandemic.
32307245,An outbreak related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019.
32307245,An extremely high potential for dissemination resulted in the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in 2020.
32307245,Despite the worsening trends of COVID-19, no drugs are validated to have significant efficacy in clinical treatment of COVID-19 patients in large-scale studies.
32307245,Remdesivir is considered the most promising antiviral agent; it works by inhibiting the activity of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp).
32307245,A large-scale study investigating the clinical efficacy of remdesivir (200 mg on day 1, followed by 100 mg once daily) is on-going.
32307245,The other excellent anti-influenza RdRp inhibitor favipiravir is also being clinically evaluated for its efficacy in COVID-19 patients.
32307245,The protease inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/RTV) alone is not shown to provide better antiviral efficacy than standard care.
32307245,However, the regimen of LPV/RTV plus ribavirin was shown to be effective against SARS-CoV in vitro.
32307245,Another promising alternative is hydroxychloroquine (200 mg thrice daily) plus azithromycin (500 mg on day 1, followed by 250 mg once daily on day 2-5), which showed excellent clinical efficacy on Chinese COVID-19 patients and anti-SARS-CoV-2 potency in vitro.
32307245,The roles of teicoplanin (which inhibits the viral genome exposure in cytoplasm) and monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 are under investigation.
32307245,Avoiding the prescription of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, or angiotensin II type I receptor blockers is advised for COVID-19 patients.
32307298,The diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) with cerebral involvement is challenging given the rarity of HLH and its resemblance to the much more common severe sepsis.
32307298,Timely diagnosis and treatment may be lifesaving.
32307298,We report two cases demonstrating different and rare forms of severe brain involvement in adult patients with HLH: acute necrotizing encephalopathy, and diffuse hemorrhagic disease due to disseminated intravascular coagulation.
32307298,Severe HLH with brain involvement in adults is rare.
32307298,HLH with cerebral involvement should be considered in patients presenting with severe systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) but negative cultures and unusual or unexpectedly severe clinical and/or radiologic signs of cerebral dysfunction.
32307298,Similar brain injury may occur in patients with cytokine storm syndrome due to COVID-19.
32307298,BACKGROUND: Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) presents with fevers, rash, organomegaly, cytopenia, and increased triglycerides and ferritin (Ramos-Casals et al., 2014) [1].
32307298,Neurologic abnormalities are reported in about one-third of patients (Cai et al., 2017), including a few cases of acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE) (Xiujuan et al., 2015).
32307298,Coagulation abnormalities are frequent in HLH patients (Valade et al., 2015).
32307298,OBJECTIVE: To raise awareness about the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of HLH with neurological involvement to prevent serious complications and demise.
32307313,Overall treatment time is an important factor of local recurrence and indirectly of distant evolution, namely in case of protracted treatments.
32307313,The current pandemic impacts on the duration of radiotherapy if patients under treatments and synchronously suffering from COVID-19.
32307313,The models used to compensate the total dose in case of temporary treatment interruption are well known but it is of importance in that pandemic context to update and homogenize clinical practice in order to improve local control without increasing normal tissue complications.
32307319,The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is placing a huge strain on health systems worldwide.
32307319,Suggested solutions like social distancing and lockdowns in some areas to help contain the spread of the virus may affect special patient populations like those with chronic illnesses who are unable to access healthcare facilities for their routine care and medicines management.
32307319,Retail pharmacy outlets are the likely facilities for easy access by these patients.
32307319,The contribution of community pharmacists in these facilities to manage chronic conditions and promote medication adherence during this COVID-19 pandemic will be essential in easing the burden on already strained health systems.
32307319,This paper highlights the pharmaceutical care practices of community pharmacists for patients with chronic diseases during this pandemic.
32307319,This would provide support for the call by the WHO to maintain essential services during the pandemic, in order to prevent non-COVID disease burden on healthcare systems particularly in low-and middle-income countries.
32307516,The SARS CoV-2-virus (COVID-19) pandemic is pushing national and international structures to their limits.
32307516,Little is known about treatment options to combat the novel virus, but the same applies to the effects of COVID-19 on people's mental health.
32307516,In Germany, as in many other countries, governmental actions impact peoples' individual freedom.
32307516,These highly necessary actions to slow down the spread of the virus, however, are a burden to the community.
32307516,We established a structured concept to support psychological burdened people in Essen, which is located in the Ruhr area, a metropolitan region with more than 5.1 million inhabitants in the heart of the federal state North Rhine Westphalia.
32307516,The psychological burden following the spread of the virus and individual restrictions should not be neglected.
32307550,WHO characterizes novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as a pandemic.
32307550,Here, we investigated the clinical, cytokine levels, T cell proportion and related gene expression occurring in COVID-19 patients on admission and after intial treatment. 11 patients diagnosed as COVID-19 with similar initial treatment regimen were enrolled in the hospital.
32307550,Plasma cytokines, CyTOF and microfluidic qPCR for gene expression were conducted. 5 mild and 6 severe patients were included.
32307550,Cough and fever were the top symptoms in the 11 COVID-2019 cases.
32307550,The elder age, more neutrophils numbers and higher C-reactive protein level were found in severe cases.
32307550,IL-10 level was significantly varied with disease progression and treatment.
32307550,The decreased T cell proportions were observed in COVID-19 patients especially in severe cases, and all elevated to normal in mild patiens after initial treatment but only CD4+T cells return to normal in severe cases.
32307550,The number of DEGs increased with the disease progress, and decreased after initial treatment.
32307550,All down-regulated DEGs in severe cases mainly involved in Th17 cell differentiation, cytokine-mediated signaling pathway and T cell activation.
32307550,After initial treatmen in severe cases, MAP2K7 and SOS1 were upregulated relative to that on admission.
32307550,Our findings show a decreased T cell proportion with down-regulated gene expression related to T cell activation and differentiation were occurred in COVID-19 severe patients, which may help to provide effective treatment strategies for COVID-19 .
32307593,Since the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak originated from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, at the end of 2019, it has become a clinical threat to the general population worldwide.
32307593,Among people infected with the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), the intensive management of the critically ill patients in intensive care unit (ICU) needs substantial medical resource.
32307593,In the present article, we have summarized the promising drugs, adjunctive agents, respiratory supportive strategies, as well as circulation management, multiple organ function monitoring and appropriate nutritional strategies for the treatment of COVID-19 in the ICU based on the previous experience of treating other viral infections and influenza.
32307593,These treatments are referable before the vaccine and specific drugs are available for COVID-19.
32307653,The expressive number of deaths and confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 call for an urgent demand of effective and available drugs for COVID-19 treatment.
32307653,CD147, a receptor on host cells, is a novel route for SARS-CoV-2 invasion.
32307653,Thus, drugs that interfere in the spike protein/CD147 interaction or CD147 expression may inhibit viral invasion and dissemination among other cells, including in progenitor/stem cells.
32307653,Studies suggest beneficial effects of azithromycin in reducing viral load of hospitalized patients, possibly interfering with ligand/CD147 receptor interactions; however, its possible effects on SARS-CoV-2 invasion has not yet been evaluated.
32307653,In addition to the possible effect in invasion, azithromycin decreases the expression of some metalloproteinases (downstream to CD147), induces anti-viral responses in primary human bronchial epithelial infected with rhinovirus, decreasing viral replication and release.
32307653,Moreover, resident lung progenitor/stem are extensively differentiated into myofibroblasts during pulmonary fibrosis, a complication observed in COVID-19 patients.
32307653,This process, and the possible direct viral invasion of progenitor/stem cells via CD147 or ACE2, could result in the decline of these cellular stocks and failing lung repair.
32307653,Clinical tests with allogeneic MSCs from healthy individuals are underway to enhance endogenous lung repair and suppress inflammation.
32307762,Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been announced as a new coronavirus disease by the World Health Organization.
32307762,At the time of writing this article (April 2020), the world is drastically influenced by the COVID-19.
32307762,Recently, the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) was published.
32307762,For researchers on ID such as ourselves, it is of key interest to learn whether this open research dataset may be used to investigate the virus and its consequences for people with an ID.
32307762,From CORD-19, we identified full-text articles containing terms related to the ID care and applied a text mining technique, specifically the term frequency-inverse document frequency analysis in combination with K-means clustering.
32307762,Two hundred fifty-nine articles contained one or more of our specified terms related to ID.
32307762,We were able to cluster these articles related to ID into five clusters on different topics, namely: mental health, viral diseases, diagnoses and treatments, maternal care and paediatrics, and genetics.
32307762,The CORD-19 open research dataset consists of valuable information about not only COVID-19 disease but also ID and the relationship between them.
32307762,We suggest researchers investigate literature-based discovery approaches on the CORD-19 and develop a new dataset that addresses the intersection of these two fields for further research.
32307905,Spinal cord injuries (SCIs) present distinct physiological and social considerations for the emergency physician.
32307905,During the COVID-19 pandemic, these considerations may generate unique challenges for emergency physicians managing patients with SCIs.
32307905,Physiological disruptions may alter the way SCI patients present with COVID-19.
32307905,The same disruptions can affect management of this vulnerable patient group, perhaps warranting early aggressive treatment.
32307905,The medical picture will often be complicated by unique social characteristics.
32307905,The reliance on caregivers for activities of daily living can, as an example, increase the human resource requirement of an ED.
32307905,Considering the vulnerabilities and complexities of patients with SCI, the community should prioritise prevention of COVID-19 infections in this group.
32307905,In the event that they do present to an ED, planning for and understanding their complexities will facilitate optimal management.
32307955,COVID-19, is a new corona virus of the Beta Coronavirus genus which originated in bats.
32307955,The virus first emerged in China in December 2019 and has rapidly spread since to other areas worldwide.
32307955,The World Health Organization (WHO) has therefore recently declared it as the source of a pandemic.
32307955,The disease caused by the virus manifests in most cases as a lower respiratory tract infection leading to fever, cough and dyspnea, while more severe cases can led to respiratory failure and/or multi organ failure.
32307955,COVID-19 enters the human cell using the ACE2, an enzyme abundant in renal tubular epithelial cells.
32307955,Theoretically, this may be significant in several ways: acute kidney injury (AKI) as well as proteinuria and/or microhematuria could be associated with the penetration of COVID-19 into the cells.
32307955,Moreover, medications based on RAAS inhibition, such and ACE inhibitors and ARBs, upregulate the enzyme ACE2 and could therefore hypothetically explain the high prevalence of hypertension and diabetes reported as previous diagnoses in severe cases.
32307955,In the setting of chronic kidney disease, the risk of infection with COVID-19 is not clear at this time.
32307955,However, hemodialysis patients represent a unique group of patients, mostly elderly and immunocompromised, for whom dialysis is a life-saving treatment which cannot be stopped.
32307955,Hence, the COVID-19 pandemic has presented a complex medical and logistic challenge for the medical staff in hospital and community based dialysis units.
32308263,New evidence on the T-cell immuno-pathology in patient's with Corona Virus Disease 2019 (CoViD-19) was reported by Diao et al. in MedRxiv (doi: 10.1101/2020.02.18.20024364) [1].
32308263,It reports observations on 522 patients with confirmed CoViD-19 symptomatology, compared to 40 control subjects.
32308263,In brief, notable T cytopoenia was recorded by flow cytometry in the CD4+ and the CD8+ populations, which were significantly yet inversely correlated with remarkably increased serum levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-a.
32308263,Flow cytometry established a progressive increase in the expression of programmed cell death marker-1 (PD-1) and T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 3 (Tim-3) as patients (n=14) deteriorated from prodromal to symptomatic CoViD-19 requiring intensive care.
32308263,Here, we interpret these observations of Diao et al from our current understanding of T cell immunophysiology and immunopathology following an immune challenge in the form of sustained viral infection, as is the case in CoViD-19, with emphasis on exhausted T cells (Tex).
32308263,Recent clinical trials to rescue Tex show promising outcomes.
32308263,The relevance of these interventions for the prevention and treatment of CoViD-19 is discussed.
32308263,Taken together, the data of Diao et al could proffer the first glimpse of immunopathology and possible immunotherapy for patients with CoViD-19.
32308494,Over 40,000 cases of coronavirus (CoV) disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been confirmed in China.
32308494,The causative agent, 2019 novel CoV (2019-nCoV), has spread rapidly to more than 25 countries worldwide.
32308494,Human-to-human transmission has accounted for most of the infections outside Wuhan.
32308494,Most studies to date on COVID-19 have focused on disease etiology and the genomics of 2019-nCoV, with few reports on the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of infected patients.
32308494,We report early clinical features of 26 patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to Liaocheng Infectious Disease Hospital in Shandong Province.
32308494,The median age of the 26 patients with COVID-19 in this study was 42 years.
32308494,The most common occupation was retail staff (16 patients, 61.54%), with 11 patients or their family members working at the same supermarket.
32308494,Only 2 patients had visited Wuhan since December 2019; the other cases of 2019-nCoV infection arose from patient-to-patient transmission.
32308494,Twelve patients had more than one sign or symptom; however, seven patients had no sign or symptom.
32308494,The average time from symptom onset to admission was 4.5 days.
32308494,CT revealed signs of bronchitis in 2 patients and unilateral and bilateral pneumonia in 9 and 15 patients, respectively.
32308494,The patients received the following treatments: antiviral therapy (100%), Chinese medicine (76.92%), antibiotics (50%), gastric mucosal protection (19.23%), immunotherapy (7.69%), and glucocorticoids (3.85%).
32308494,Most patients (25/26) required ≥1 treatment.
32308494,In contrast to previous reports, most patients (24/26) had not been in close contact with individuals from Wuhan.
32308494,Additionally, 11 patients or their family members worked at the same supermarket, suggesting active viral transmission in a location frequented by a large number of people.
32308494,Close monitoring is essential for preventing the large-scale spread of the virus in such places.
32308732,A novel coronavirus was identified in December, 2019 in Wuhan, China, and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) played an active role in combating the novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) caused by this fast-spreading virus COVID-19.
32308732,Thus, we aimed to explore TCM characteristics of clinical efficacy to NCP, as well as to optimize Qingfei Paidu decoction (QFPDD) and the recommended formulas to NCP by National Health Commission (NHC).
32308732,Chinese medical sciences theory and clinical application of TCM were analyzed.
32308732,A total of 54 NCP patients were observed in a hospital from Wuhan, whose clinical characteristics and utilization of Chinese Medicines (CMs) were described.
32308732,Paired t test was used to measure the change of patients' hemogram during hospitalization period, indicating the effect of CMs.
32308732,Multiple linear regression analysis was applied to explore the factors affecting the length of hospital stay.
32308732,Network pharmacology analysis was applied to figure out the performance of NHC-recommended formulas of five disease stages at levels of compounds, targets and pathways.
32308732,The average length of hospital stay was 8.96 days.
32308732,Patients over 45 stayed 9.79 days in hospital in average, longer than 7.64 days of patients under 45.
32308732,Comparing the hemograms between admission and discharge of hospital, the number of leukocytes, neutrophil, lymphocyte and platelet increased, while the numbers of erythrocytes, hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit decreased.
32308732,According to the standard coefficients of regression, the factor affecting the length of stay for the most was CMs in category of invigorating spleen and removing dampness (ISRD), followed by administrating CMs, male, and cough.
32308732,Thirty-two CMs were screened after deleting duplication from QFPDD and NHC-recommended formulas.
32308732,Compound quercetin, luteolin, kaempferol, acacetin etc., were all involved in the treatment of various disease stages on the compound level both in generality and individuality.
32308732,TCM has a systemic theoretical understanding on the pathological evolution and a positive clinical efficacy on NCP.
32308732,The CMs of ISRD improved patients' recovery, suggesting the importance of regulating intestinal function and keeping microenvironmental balance in TCM treatment of NCP.
32308732,The active compounds from QFPDD and NHC-recommended formulas contribute to recovery of varied disease progresses during TCM treating NCP.
32309679,The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a proliferation of clinical trials that are designed to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
32309679,The overwhelming majority of cardiovascular and cancer patients are at increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection; accordingly, the cardiovascular and cardio-oncology communities are playing a major role in caring for COVID-19 patients.
32309679,Many of the therapeutic agents that are being used to treat patients with COVID-19 are repurposed treatments for influenza, drugs that were not effective in Ebola patients, or treatments for malaria that were developed decades ago, and are unlikely to be familiar to the cardiovascular and cardio-oncology communities.
32309679,Here we have provided a foundation for cardiovascular and cardio-oncology physicians who are on the frontline providing care to COVID-19 patients, so that they can better understand the emerging cardiovascular epidemiology of COVID-19, as well as the biological rationale for the clinical trials that are ongoing for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.
32309809,The purpose of the current systematic review is to evaluate the efficacy of antiviral therapies in treatment of COVID-19.
32309809,In addition, clinical trials on the efficacy of antiviral therapies in the management of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-Cov) or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have also been reviewed, in order to identify potential treatment options for COVID-19.
32309809,An extensive search was performed in Medline, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science and CENTRAL databases until the end of March 15, 2020.
32309809,Two independent researchers performed the screening, and finally the related studies were included.
32309809,Only one clinical trial on the efficacy of antiviral therapy in management of COVID-19 was found.
32309809,The results depicted that adding Lopinavir-Ritonavir to the standard treatment regimen of patients with severe COVID-19 has no benefits.
32309809,Moreover, 21 case-series and case-report studies reported the prescription of antiviral agents in COVID-19, none of which can be used to determine the efficacy of antiviral therapies in confronting COVID-19.
32309809,In addition, no clinical trials were found to be performed on the efficacy of antiviral agents in the management of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
32309809,The current evidence impede researchers from proposing an appropriate antiviral therapy against COVID-19, making the current situation a serious concern for international organizations such as World Health Organization (WHO).
32309809,In the time of the current pandemic and future epidemics, organizations such as WHO should pursue more proactive actions and plan well-designed clinical trials so that their results can be used in managing future epidemics.
32309812,SARS-CoV-2 virus causes a pneumonia that was identified through fever, dyspnea, and acute respiratory symptoms and named COVID-19.
32309812,This disease exacerbates in a number of patients and causes pulmonary edema, multi-organ failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
32309812,Prevalence of ARDS among COVID-19 patients has been reported to be up to 17%.
32309812,Among the introduced treatment methods for management of ARDS patients, prone position can be used as an adjuvant therapy for improving ventilation in these patients.
32309812,Here we reviewed the literature regarding the role of prone position in management of COVID-19 patients.
32310190,The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has infected nearly 3,582,233 individuals with 248,558 deaths since it was first identified in human populations in December 2019 in Wuhan, China.
32310190,No antiviral therapies or vaccines are available for their treatment or prevention.
32310190,Passive immunization PI through broadly neutralizing antibodies that bind to the specific antigens of SARS-CoV 2 might be a potential solution to address the immediate health threat of COVID-19 pandemic while vaccines are being developed.
32310190,The PI approach in treating COVID-19 is discussed herein, including a summary of its historical applications to confront epidemics.
32310621,Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a large family of enveloped, single-stranded, zoonotic RNA viruses.
32310621,Four CoVs commonly circulate among humans: HCoV2-229E, -HKU1, -NL63 and -OC43.
32310621,However, CoVs can rapidly mutate and recombine leading to novel CoVs that can spread from animals to humans.
32310621,The novel CoVs severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012.
32310621,The 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is currently causing a severe outbreak of disease (termed COVID-19) in China and multiple other countries, threatening to cause a global pandemic.
32310621,In humans, CoVs mostly cause respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms.
32310621,Clinical manifestations range from a common cold to more severe disease such as bronchitis, pneumonia, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure and even death.
32310621,SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 seem to less commonly affect children and to cause fewer symptoms and less severe disease in this age group compared with adults, and are associated with much lower case-fatality rates.
32310621,Preliminary evidence suggests children are just as likely as adults to become infected with SARS-CoV-2 but are less likely to be symptomatic or develop severe symptoms.
32310621,However, the importance of children in transmitting the virus remains uncertain.
32310621,Children more often have gastrointestinal symptoms compared with adults.
32310621,Most children with SARS-CoV present with fever, but this is not the case for the other novel CoVs.
32310621,Many children affected by MERS-CoV are asymptomatic.
32310621,The majority of children infected by novel CoVs have a documented household contact, often showing symptoms before them.
32310621,In contrast, adults more often have a nosocomial exposure.
32310621,In this review, we summarize epidemiologic, clinical and diagnostic findings, as well as treatment and prevention options for common circulating and novel CoVs infections in humans with a focus on infections in children.
32310920,The integrated clinical, laboratory and ultrasound approach is essential for the diagnosis, monitoring and evaluation of the patient's therapy in COVID-19 pneumonia.
32310920,The ideal imaging strategy in this setting is not yet well defined.
32310920,Bedside pulmonary ultrasound presents an undeniable series of advantages in patients at high risk of infection, and can provide incremental data in the respiratory intensive care for the serial control of the individual patient, as well as for home delivery of stabilized patients.
32310920,Chest X-ray is characterized by low sensitivity in identifying earlier lung changes.
32310920,Pulmonary computed tomography shows high sensitivity but should not be routinely performed in all patients, because in the first 48 h it can be absolutely negative, and in the late phase imaging findings may not change the therapeutic approach.
32310920,Echocardiography should be limited to patients with hemodynamic instability.
32310921,The SARS-COVID-19 pandemic is bringing to light significant issues that require deliberations on how to manage patients at high cardiovascular risk or with proven heart disease.
32310921,The evidence that the hospital can be a place where one might contract the infection and spread the disease has drastically reduced non-COVID-19 accesses to emergency rooms (ER) and to elective non-COVID-19 hospital activities.
32310921,If this, on one hand, results in reducing improper access to the ER and hospital, on the other hand it substantiates the risk of underestimating problems not connected to COVID-19, such as an increased delay in the diagnosis and treatment of acute myocardial infarction and other cardiovascular emergencies.
32310921,In addition, the need to reorganize hospital activities to treat patients suffering from serious COVID-19 disease forms forces us to reflect on how to safely manage patients who stay at home with milder COVID-19 disease forms and the need to keep the most vulnerable subjects, such as patients with chronic heart failure, away from the hospital.
32310921,The problem is furtherly amplified by the uncertain trend of the epidemic, by the duration of forced isolation and limited mobility measures and by the inadequate integration between hospital and territory, especially in high-risk areas such as residences for the elderly or in socially and economically fragile environments.
32310921,Our opinion is that a syndemic approach, which considers the complex interplay between social, economic, environmental and clinical problems, can be the most appropriate and achieved by means the contribution of telemedicine and telecardiology, intended as integration and not as an alternative to traditional management.
32310921,A flexible use of telematic tools, now available for teleconsultation, and/or remote monitoring adapted to the needs of clinical, family and social-health contexts could allow the creation of integrated and personalized management programs that are effective and efficient for the care of patients.
32311114,Since March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to the need to re-think the delivery of services to patients with chronic dysimmune neuropathies.
32311114,Telephone/video consultations have become widespread but have compounded concerns about objective evaluation.
32311114,Therapeutic decisions need, more than ever before, to be considered in the best interests of both patients, and society, while not denying function-preserving/restoring treatment.
32311114,Immunoglobulin therapy and plasma exchange, for those treated outside of the home, expose patients to the hazards of hospital or outpatient infusion centers.
32311114,Steroid therapy initiation and continuation pose increased infectious risk.
32311114,Immunosuppressant therapy similarly becomes highly problematic, with the risks of treatment continuation enhanced by uncertainties regarding duration of the pandemic.
32311114,The required processes necessitate considerable time and effort especially as resources and staff are re-deployed to face the pandemic, but are essential for protecting this group of patients and as an integral part of wider public health actions.
32311151,Under the outbreak of COVID-19, it was urgent to analyze the cases from clinical features and epidemiological factors, as well as understand the effectiveness of measures taken on disease prevent and control.
32311151,A retrospective study was applied for descriptive analysis of clinical features and epidemiological factors of confirmed cases in four cities of Zhejiang.
32311151,The Onset-admission interval was calculated and plotted as well.
32311151,The provincial measures regarding the response of COVID-19 were summed up and sorted out.
32311151,The distribution and sex and age were under normality distribution, and the age of 20 to 80 were all in risk of developing the disease.
32311151,Clinical features of fever and cough were found mostly happen on patients.
32311151,More than half of the patients had image changed on chest from reported data.
32311151,The factor of closely contacted with confirmed cases was the most cause to the disease.
32311151,The median onset-admission interval was 6 days in Zhejiang province.
32311151,As of the efficient health system, COVID-19 had been successfully prevented and controlled in Zhejiang.
32311151,Males and females were all vulnerable to COVID-19.
32311151,Preventing contact with confirmed cases could largely avoid the disease to happen.
32311151,The government should take emergent and effective measures to prevent and treatment of the pandemic disease.
32311437,COVID-19 (corona virus disease 2019) is a kind of acute severe pneumonia caused by 2019-nCoV (2019-nCoV) infection.
32311437,Since December 2019, it has been found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, and then spread to the whole country.
32311437,Some parts of the world also showed an outbreak trend [1-3].
32311437,Real-time fluorescence quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction,RT-PCR) and viral gene sequencing are the gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
32311437,At present, upper respiratory tract nasopharyngeal swabs are mostly used as nucleic acid detection samples in China, but the positive rate is low.
32311437,However, there are few reports on clinical application of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection in other biological samples.
32311437,METHODS: | The East Section of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University is a designated COVID-19 hospital in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.
32311437,This observation study included 132 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in the infectious disease areas of the East Section of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from 2020.1.31 to 2020.2.29.
32311437,COVID-19 diagnostic criteria: according to China's ⟪pneumonia diagnosis and treatment Program of novel coronavirus infection (trial version 7) ⟫, in accordance with the relevant epidemiological and clinical manifestations, nasopharyngeal swabs real-time fluorescence RT-PCR detection of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid positive, COVID-19 cases were divided into mild, ordinary, severe and severe [1].
32311437,The nasopharyngeal swabs of 132 cases of COVID-19 were positive for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid on admission, including 72 males and 60 females, with an average age of 66.7 ± 9.1 years, including 80 cases of common type, 44 cases of severe type and 8 cases of critical type.
32311437,During the period of admission, under the condition of tertiary protection, nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum, blood, feces and anal swabs of COVID-19 cases were collected many times in the isolation ward for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection.
32311437,All biological samples are sealed and transferred to the laboratory in strict accordance with the standard process.
32311437,The RT-PCR test kits (BioGerm) were recommended by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.
32311437,The same technician and brand of test kit was used for all RT-PCR testing reported; both internal controls and negative controls were routinely performed with each batch of tests.
32311437,RESULTS: | 132 the results of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test of various biological samples during the treatment of confirmed COVID-19 cases are as follows: the positive rate of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test of nasopharyngeal swab is 38.13% (180/472 times), the positive rate of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test of sputum is 48.68% (148/304 times), the positive rate of blood 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test is 3.03% (4/132 times), and the positive rate of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test of feces is 9.83% (24/244 times).
32311437,The positive rate of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection in anal swabs is 10.00% (12/120 times).
32311437,DISCUSSION|: In this study, it was found that the positive rate of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid in sputum of 132 patients with COVID-19 was higher than that of nasopharyngeal swabs, and viral nucleic acids were also detected in blood and digestive tract (fecal/anal swabs).
32311437,Simple detection of nasopharyngeal swab 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection positive rate is not high, multi-sample 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection can improve the accuracy, reduce the false negative rate, better guide clinical treatment and evaluate the therapeutic effect.
32311448,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a viral respiratory illness caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), may predispose patients to thrombotic disease, both in the venous and arterial circulations, due to excessive inflammation, platelet activation, endothelial dysfunction, and stasis.
32311448,In addition, many patients receiving antithrombotic therapy for thrombotic disease may develop COVID-19, which can have implications for choice, dosing, and laboratory monitoring of antithrombotic therapy.
32311448,Moreover, during a time with much focus on COVID-19, it is critical to consider how to optimize the available technology to care for patients without COVID-19 who have thrombotic disease.
32311448,Herein, we review the current understanding of the pathogenesis, epidemiology, management and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 who develop venous or arterial thrombosis, and of those with preexisting thrombotic disease who develop COVID-19, or those who need prevention or care for their thrombotic disease during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32311643,The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 pandemic is a global health problem, which started to affect China by the end of 2019.
32311643,In Europe, Italy has faced this novel disease entity (named novel coronavirus disease [COVID-19]) first and severely.
32311643,COVID-19 represents a significant hurdle for public health services and a potential harm for patients with cancer.
32311643,The Collegio Italiano dei Primari Oncologi Medici (CIPOMO) is an Italian association of head physicians in oncology departments, which promotes working and research activities in oncology on a national basis.
32311643,In the midst of the epidemic in Italy, the CIPOMO promoted a national survey aiming to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on clinical activity of oncologists and the implementation of containment measures of COVID-19 diffusion.
32311643,Overall, 122 head physicians participated in this survey, with a homogeneous distribution on the national territory.
32311643,Results show that the following measures for oncologic patients have been promptly implemented through the whole country: use of protective devices, triage of patients accessing the hospital, delay of non-urgent visits and use of telemedicine.
32311643,Results of this survey suggest that Italian oncology departments have promptly set a proactive approach to the actual emergency.
32311643,Oncologists need to preserve the continuum of care of patients, as the benefit of ensuring a well-delivered anti-cancer treatment plan outweighs the risk of COVID-19 infection.
32311643,International cooperation is an important starting point, as heavily affected nations can serve as an example to find out ways to safely preserve health activity during the pandemic.
32311668,The new coronavirus outbreak is an ongoing pandemic that is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32311668,The new coronavirus SARS-Cov-2 belongs to the subfamily of β-coronaviruses and shares 79.5% of the genetic sequence of SARS-CoV, the causative agent of the epidemic that started in 2002 and ended in 2004.
32311668,Considering the clinical impact of the new outbreak, it is highly important to study the potential responses of the human immune system during the SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as the role of virus-specific T cells and by B-lymphocytes.
32311668,Moreover, specific data on the production of IgG and IgM is crucial to allow the rapid identification of the infection.
32311668,In this paper we also described the importance of sensitive and specific rapid test for SARS-CoV-2.
32311668,Indeed, this test represents an important immunological tool aimed at identifying the precise phase of the infection in order to undertake a more appropriate pharmacological treatment.
32311668,Lastly, we provided an overview of pharmacological treatments aimed to reduce inflammatory processes underlying the infection and the need for the discovery of a new vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.
32311760,Severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is a member of the coronavirus family.
32311760,Coronavirus infections in humans are typically associated with respiratory illnesses; however, viral RNA has been isolated in serum from infected patients.
32311760,Coronaviruses have been identified as a potential low-risk threat to blood safety.
32311760,The Mirasol Pathogen Reduction Technology (PRT) System utilizes riboflavin and ultraviolet (UV) light to render blood-borne pathogens noninfectious, while maintaining blood product quality.
32311760,Here, we report on the efficacy of riboflavin and UV light against the pandemic virus SARS-CoV-2 when tested in both plasma and platelets units.
32311760,Stock SARS-CoV-2 was grown in Vero cells and inoculated into either plasma or platelet units.
32311760,Those units were then treated with riboflavin and UV light.
32311760,The infectious titres of SARS-CoV-2 were determined by plaque assay using Vero cells.
32311760,A total of five (n = 5) plasma and three (n = 3) platelet products were evaluated in this study.
32311760,In both experiments, the measured titre of SARS-CoV-2 was below the limit of detection following treatment with riboflavin and UV light.
32311760,The mean log reductions in the viral titres were ≥3·40 and ≥4·53 for the plasma units and platelet units, respectively.
32311760,Riboflavin and UV light effectively reduced the titre of SARS-CoV-2 in both plasma and platelet products to below the limit of detection in tissue culture.
32311760,The data suggest that the process would be effective in reducing the theoretical risk of transfusion transmitted SARS-CoV-2.
32311826,The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic originated in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019.
32311826,The etiologic agent is a novel coronavirus of presumed zoonotic origin with structural similarity to the viruses responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).
32311826,Like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 infection manifests most frequently with lower respiratory symptoms.
32311826,A minority of patients progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome/ diffuse alveolar damage.
32311826,In addition to its central role in the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection, the clinical laboratory provides critical information to clinicians regarding prognosis, disease course, and response to therapy.
32311826,The purpose of this review is to 1) provide background context about the origins and course of the pandemic 2) discuss the laboratory's role in the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection 3) summarize the current state of biomarker analysis in COVID-19 infection, with an emphasis on markers derived from the hematology laboratory 4) comment on the impact of COVID-19 on hematology laboratory safety, and 5) describe the impact the pandemic has had on organized national and international educational activities worldwide.
32311836,Patients with rheumatic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and lupus have increased risk of infection and are treated with medications that may increase this risk yet are also hypothesized to help treat COVID-19.
32311836,We set out to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the lives of these patients in the United States.
32311836,Participants in a US-wide longitudinal observational registry responded to a supplemental COVID-19 questionnaire by e-mail on March 25, 2020, about their symptoms, COVID-19 testing, health care changes, and related experiences during the prior 2 weeks.
32311836,Analysis compared responses by diagnosis, disease activity, and new onset of symptoms.
32311836,Qualitative analysis was conducted on optional free-text comment fields.
32311836,Of the 7061 participants invited to participate, 530 responded, with RA as the most frequent diagnosis (61%).
32311836,Eleven participants met COVID-19 screening criteria, of whom two sought testing unsuccessfully.
32311836,Six others sought testing, three of whom were successful, and all test results were negative.
32311836,Not quite half of participants (42%) reported a change to their care in the prior 2 weeks.
32311836,Qualitative analysis revealed four key themes: emotions in response to the pandemic, perceptions of risks from immunosuppressive medications, protective measures to reduce risk of COVID-19 infection, and disruptions in accessing rheumatic disease medications, including hydroxychloroquine.
32311836,After 2 weeks, many participants with rheumatic diseases already had important changes to their health care, with many altering medications without professional consultation or because of hydroxychloroquine shortage.
32311836,As evidence accumulates on the effectiveness of potential COVID-19 treatments, effort is needed to safeguard access to established treatments for rheumatic diseases.
32311843,In March 2020, the global healthcare system is overwhelmed by patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, which is the cause of the coronavirus pandemic (Covid-2019).
32311843,A large number of these patients end up in the intensive care units (ICU) with critical illness requiring mechanical ventilation.
32311843,One of the most important clinical features of the infection is a profound coagulopathy.
32311843,In a recent cohort study 71% of patients who eventually died matched the ISTH criteria for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), while this percentage was only 0.6% in patients who survived.
32312025,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is typically diagnosed by specific assays that detect viral nucleic acid from the upper respiratory tract; however, this may miss infections involving only the lower airways.
32312025,Computed tomography (CT) has been described as a diagnostic modality in the COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment plan.
32312025,We present a case series with virologically confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia.
32312025,Variable CT features were observed: consolidation with ground-glass opacities, ground-glass opacities with subpleural reticular bands, and an anterior-posterior gradient of lung abnormalities resembling that of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
32312025,In one patient, we noted evolution of CT findings, where there was interval resolution of bilateral lung consolidation with development of bronchiolectasis and subpleural fibrotic bands.
32312025,While sensitive for detecting lung parenchymal abnormalities in COVID-19 pneumonia, CT for initial diagnosis is discouraged and should be reserved for specific clinical indications.
32312025,Interpretation of chest CT findings should be correlated with duration of symptoms to better determine the disease stage and aid in patient management.
32312064,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new infectious disease, firstly appeared in Wuhan city and has rapidly spread to 114 countries outside China, which is receiving worldwide attention.
32312064,As two important means of examination, computed tomography (CT) and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) have always been controversial in the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia.
32312064,Here, we report a family cluster case of a father and a son diagnosed as COVID-19 at our hospital, and described the clinical manifestations, laboratory results, CT changes, diagnosis and treatment strategy of these two patients.
32312064,Focus on the value of these two methods in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases, as well as their respective deficiencies.
32312064,For patient 1 (father), the efficacy of RT-PCR is not satisfactory either in terms of diagnosis or follow-up, which may cause misdiagnosis and delay treatment.
32312064,For patient 2 (son), the clinical symptoms were not obvious, but CT imaging clearly displayed dynamic changes of the lung lesions.
32312064,Meanwhile, the two patients respectively underwent five chest CT examinations during their hospitalization and discharge follow-up, showing the potential harm of radiation.
32312064,Therefore, in clinical work, doctors should make full use of the advantages of CT and RT-PCR, and take other measures to make up for their disadvantages.
32312163,The impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on the management of head and neck cancer must be addressed.
32312163,Immediate measures to reduce transmission rates and protect patients and providers take priority and necessitate some delays in care, particularly for patients with mild symptoms or less aggressive cancers.
32312163,However, strict guidelines have yet to be developed, and many unintentional delays in care are to be expected based on the magnitude of the looming public health crisis.
32312163,The medical complexity of head and neck cancer management may lead to prolonged delays that worsen treatment outcomes.
32312163,Therefore, those caring for patients with head and neck cancer must take action to reduce these negative impacts as the country rallies to overcome the challenges posed by this pandemic.
32312290,COVID-19 threatens to quickly overwhelm our existing critical care infrastructure in the USA.
32312290,Systemic tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) has been previously demonstrated to improve PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> (mmHg) when given to critically ill patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
32312290,It is unclear to what extent tPA may impact population-based survival during the current US COVID-19 pandemic.
32312290,A decision analytic Markov state transition model was created to simulate the life critically ill COVID-19 patients as they transitioned to either recovery or death.
32312290,Two patient groups were simulated (50,000 patients in each group); (1) Patients received tPA immediately upon diagnosis of ARDS and (2) patients received standard therapy for ARDS.
32312290,Base case critically ill COVID-19 patients were defined as having a refractory PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> of &lt; 60 mmHg (salvage use criteria).
32312290,Transition from severe to moderate to mild ARDS, recovery, and death were estimated.
32312290,Markov model parameters were extracted from existing ARDS/COVID-19 literature.
32312290,The use of tPA was associated with reduced mortality (47.6% [tTPA] vs.
32312290,71.0% [no tPA]) for base case patients.
32312290,When extrapolated to the projected COVID-19 eligible for salvage use tPA in the USA, peak mortality (deaths/100,000 patients) was reduced for both optimal social distancing (70.5 [tPA] vs.
32312290,75.0 [no tPA]) and no social distancing (158.7 [tPA] vs.
32312290,168.8 [no tPA]) scenarios.
32312290,Salvage use of tPA may improve recovery of ARDS patients, thereby reducing COVID-19-related mortality and ensuring sufficient resources to manage this pandemic.
32312363,To study the clinical features of children with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.
32312363,A retrospective analysis was performed for the clinical data of 115 children who were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Wuhan Children's Hospital, including general information, history of close contact with individuals of SARS-CoV-2 infection, early clinical symptoms, laboratory examination results, and lung CT results.
32312363,Among the 115 children, there were 73 boys (63.5%) and 42 girls (36.5%), with a male/female ratio of 1:0.58.
32312363,Of the 115 children, 105 (91.3%) had a definite history of close contact with individuals of SARS-CoV-2-infection.
32312363,An increase in alanine aminotransferase was observed in 11 children (9.6%) and an increase in CK-MB was found in 34 children (29.6%).
32312363,As for clinical symptoms, 29 children (25.2%) had fever, 47 (40.9%) had respiratory symptoms (including cough, rhinorrhea, and nasal congestion), and 61 (53.0%) were asymptomatic.
32312363,Lung CT findings showed ground glass opacity, fiber opacities, patchy changes, and pulmonary consolidation in 49 children (42.6%), among whom 2 children had &quot;white lung&quot;; 39 children (33.9%) only had lung texture enhancement and 27 children (23.5%) had no pulmonary imaging changes.
32312363,Among the 115 children, 3 were critically ill, among whom 1 had been cured and the other 2 were under continuous treatment.
32312363,Most of the children with SARS-CoV-2 infection have a close contact history.
32312363,Critical cases are rare and there is a high proportion of asymptomatic infection.
32312365,The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) started in December 2019 in China and the epidemic is still going on at present.
32312365,Since children are the susceptible population, the number of cases is gradually increasing.
32312365,In addition to the typical respiratory symptoms, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection also has the clinical symptoms of cardiovascular system damage.
32312365,Based on a literature review, this article discusses the possible cardiovascular system damage caused by SARS-CoV-2 in children and related mechanisms, in order to provide help for the timely treatment and prevention of cardiovascular system damage caused by SARS-CoV-2 in children.
32312544,The risk/benefit ratio of a number of palliative and (neo)adjuvant treatments should be reconsidered during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32312544,We provide treatment advice as a pragmatic perspective on the risk/benefit ratio in specific clinical scenarios.
32312567,The lack of ressources and coordination to face the epidemic of coronavirus raises concerns for the health of patients with mental disorders in a country where we keep in memory the dramatic experience of famine in psychiatric hospitals during the Second World War.
32312567,This article aims at proposing guidance to ensure mental health care during the SARS-CoV epidemy in France.
32312567,Authors performed a narrative review identifying relevant results in the scientific and medical literature and local initiatives in France.
32312567,We identified four types of major vulnerabilities in patients suffering from mental disorders during this pandemic: (1) medical comorbidities that are more frequently found in patients suffering from mental disorders (cardiovascular and pulmonary pathologies, diabetes, obesity, etc.) which represent risk factors for severe infections with Covid-19; (2) age (the elderly constituting the population most vulnerable to coronavirus); (3) cognitive and behavioral troubles which can hamper compliance with confinement and hygiene measures and finally and (4) psychosocial vulnerability due to stigmatization and/or socio-economic difficulties.
32312567,Furthermore, the mental health healthcare system is more vulnerable than other healthcare systems.
32312567,Current government plans are poorly adapted to psychiatric establishments in a context of major shortage of organizational, material and human resources.
32312567,In addition, a certain number of structural aspects make the psychiatric institution particularly vulnerable: many beds are closed, wards have a high density of patients, mental health community facilities are closed, medical teams are understaffed and poorly trained to face infectious diseases.
32312567,We could also face major issues in referring patients with acute mental disorders to intensive care units.
32312567,To maintain continuity of psychiatric care in this pandemic situation, several directions can be considered, in particular with the creation of Covid+ units.
32312567,These units are under the dual supervision of a psychiatrist and of an internist/infectious disease specialist; all new entrants should be placed in quarantine for 14 days; the nurse staff should benefit from specific training, from daily medical check-ups and from close psychological support.
32312567,Family visits would be prohibited and replaced by videoconference.
32312567,At the end of hospitalization, in particular for the population of patients in compulsory ambulatory care situations, specific case-management should be organized with the possibility of home visits, in order to support them when they get back home and to help them to cope with the experience of confinement, which is at risk to induce recurrences of mental disorders.
32312567,The total or partial closure of mental health community facilities is particularly disturbing for patients but a regular follow-up is possible with telemedicine and should include the monitoring of the suicide risk and psychoeducation strategies; developing support platforms could also be very helpful in this context.
32312567,Private psychiatrists have also a crucial role of information with their patients on confinement and barrier measures, but also on measures to prevent the psychological risks inherent to confinement: maintenance of sleep regularity, physical exercise, social interactions, stress management and coping strategies, prevention of addictions, etc.
32312567,They should also be trained to prevent, detect and treat early warning symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, because their prevalence was high in the regions of China most affected by the pandemic.
32312567,French mental healthcare is now in a great and urgent need for reorganization and must also prepare in the coming days and weeks to face an epidemic of emotional disorders due to the containment of the general population.
32312568,COVID-19 is spreading almost all over the world at present, which is caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
32312568,It was an epidemic firstly in Hubei province of China.
32312568,The Chinese government has formally set COVID-19 in the statutory notification and control system for infectious diseases according to the Law of the People's Republic of China on the Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases.
32312568,China currently is still struggling to respond to COVID-19 though intensive actions with progress made.
32312568,The Burn Department of our hospital is one of sections with the highest infectious risk of COVID-19.
32312568,Based on our own experience and the guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 (7th Version) with other regulations and literature, we describe our experience with suggestions for medical practices for burn units during the COVID-19 outbreak.
32312568,We hope these experiences and suggestions benefit our international colleagues during the pandemic of the COVID-19.
32312600,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory tract infection caused by a newly emergent coronavirus, that was first recognized in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.
32312600,Currently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has defined the infection as a global pandemic and there is a health and social emergency for the management of this new infection.
32312600,While most people with COVID-19 develop only mild or uncomplicated illness, approximately 14% develop severe disease that requires hospitalization and oxygen support, and 5% require admission to an intensive care unit.
32312600,In severe cases, COVID-19 can be complicated by the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and septic shock, and multiorgan failure.
32312600,This consensus document has been prepared on evidence-informed guidelines developed by a multidisciplinary panel of health care providers from four Spanish scientific societies (Spanish Society of Intensive Care Medicine [SEMICYUC], Spanish Society of Pulmonologists [SEPAR], Spanish Society of Emergency [SEMES], Spanish Society of Anesthesiology, Reanimation, and Pain [SEDAR]) with experience in the clinical management of patients with COVID-19 and other viral infections, including SARS, as well as sepsis and ARDS.
32312600,The document provides clinical recommendations for the noninvasive respiratory support (noninvasive ventilation, high flow oxygen therapy with nasal cannula) in any patient with suspected or confirmed presentation of COVID-19 with acute respiratory failure.
32312600,This consensus guidance should serve as a foundation for optimized supportive care to ensure the best possible chance for survival and to allow for reliable comparison of investigational therapeutic interventions as part of randomized controlled trials.
32312646,This document outlines recommendations for physiotherapy management for COVID-19 in the acute hospital setting.
32312646,It includes: recommendations for physiotherapy workforce planning and preparation; a screening tool for determining requirement for physiotherapy; and recommendations for the selection of physiotherapy treatments and personal protective equipment.
32312646,It is intended for use by physiotherapists and other relevant stakeholders in the acute care setting caring for adult patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19.
32312892,The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has necessitated changes in cancer care delivery as resources are reallocated.
32312892,Clinical trials and other research activities are inevitably impacted.
32312892,Start-up activities for new trials may be deferred and recruitment suspended.
32312892,For patients already enrolled however, there are challenges in continuing treatment on trial.
32312892,Regulatory bodies have issued guidance on managing clinical trials during the pandemic, including contingency measures for remote study visits, delivery of investigational product, and site monitoring visits.
32312892,New cancer clinical trial practices during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic include new risk assessment strategies, decentralized and remote trial coordination, data collection, and delegation of specific therapeutic activities.
32312892,This experience could provide evidence of more feasible and cost-effective methods for future clinical trial conduct.
32312919,In the last several weeks we have been witnessing the exponentially progressing pandemic SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.
32312919,As the number of people infected with SARS-CoV2 escalates, the problem of surgical management of patients requiring urgent surgery is increasing.
32312919,Patients infected with SARS-CoV2 virus but with negative test results will appear in general hospitals and may pose a risk to other patients and hospital staff.
32312919,Health care workers constitutes nearly 17% of infected population in Poland, therefore early identification of infected people becomes a priority to protect human resources and to ensure continuity of the access to a surgical care.
32312919,Both surgical operations, and endoscopic procedures are considered as interventions with an increased risk of infection.
32312919,Therefore, determining the algorithm becomes crucial for qualifying patients for surgical treatment, but also to stratify the risk of personnel being infected during surgery and to adequately protect staff.
32312919,Each hospital should be logistically prepared for the need to perform urgent surgery on a patient with suspected or confirmed infection, including personal protective equipment.
32312919,Limited availability of the equipment, working under pressure and staff shortages in addition to a highly contagious pathogen necessitate a pragmatic management of human resources in health care.
32312919,Instant synchronized action is needed, and clear uniform guidelines are essential for the healthcare system to provide citizens with the necessary surgical care while protecting both patients, and staff.
32312919,This document presents current recommendations regarding surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland.
32313463,The coronavirus (CoV) epidemic that began in China in December 2019 follows earlier epidemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV in China and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV in Saudi Arabia.
32313463,The full genome of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has now been shared, and data have been gathered from several case series.
32313463,As of February 11, 2020, there have been 45,182 laboratory-confirmed cases, the vast majority in China, with 1115 deaths, for an overall case-fatality rate of 2.5%.
32313463,Cases have been confirmed in 27 countries.
32313463,On average, each patient infects 2.2 other people.
32313463,Symptomatic infection appears to predominantly affect adults, with a 5-day estimated incubation period between infection and symptom onset.
32313463,The most common presenting symptoms are fever, cough, dyspnea, and myalgias and/or fatigue.
32313463,All cases reported to date have shown radiographic evidence of pneumonia. 2019-nCoV is diagnosed by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction.
32313463,Treatment is largely supportive, with regimens including antiviral therapy.
32313463,Corticosteroids are not routinely recommended.
32313463,Hand hygiene, prompt identification and isolation of suspect patients, and appropriate use of personal protective equipment are the most reliable methods to contain the epidemic.
32313660,The beginning of the novel SARS-CoV-2 human coronavirus in Wuhan, China, has triggered a worldwide respiratory disease outbreak (COVID-19).
32313660,By April 07, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has affected more than 1.36 million people worldwide and caused more than 75,900 deaths.
32313660,To date, the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine found to be a treatment option for SARS-CoV-2.
32313660,In addition to supportive treatment, such as oxygen supply in moderate cases and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in critically ill patients, unique medications for this condition are also under investigation.
32313660,Here we reviewed the antibody therapy might be an immediate strategy for emergency prophylaxis and SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
32313662,Veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) is one of the ultimate treatments for acute respiratory failure.
32313662,However, the effectiveness of ECMO in patients with novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is unknown.
32313662,A 72-year-old woman who was a passenger of a cruise ship tested positive for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) while in quarantine on board using throat swab.
32313662,Three days after admission, her condition deteriorated, and she was subsequently intubated.
32313662,On day 6, VV-ECMO was introduced.
32313662,Lopinavir/ritonavir was given; continuous renal replacement therapy was also introduced.
32313662,On day 10, her chest radiography and lung compliance improved.
32313662,She was weaned off ECMO on day 12.
32313662,Treatment of severe pneumonia in COVID-19 by ECMO should recognize lung plasticity considering time to ECMO introduction and interstitial biomarkers.
32313662,In Japan, centralization of ECMO patients has not been sufficient.
32313662,Thus, we suggest nationwide centralization and further research to respond to the crisis caused by COVID-19.
32313713,This study aimed to evaluate the effect of optimization of the intravenous infusion workflow in isolation wards for patients with coronavirus disease 2019.
32313713,The infusion management group optimized the intravenous infusion workflow based on Hamer's Process Reengineering Theory and applied it to the treatment of patients with coronavirus disease 2019.
32313713,The work efficiency, patients' satisfaction and economic indicators before and after optimization were compared.
32313713,After the infusion workflow was optimized, average times for preparation drugs and intravenous admixture, and patients' waiting time decreased from 4.84 min, 4.03 min, and 34.33 min to 3.50 min, 2.60 min, and 30.87 min, respectively, patients' satisfaction increased from 66.7% to 93.3%, and the cost of personal protective equipment (PPE) decreased from 46.67 sets and 186.6 CNY per day to 36.17 sets and 144.6 CNY, with statistical significance.
32313713,The optimization of the intravenous infusion workflow can effectively decrease the cost of PPE while improving the efficiency of infusion and patients' satisfaction.
32313823,The novel coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) is now in an outbreak not only in China but also around the world, suspected to be originated from a wet market in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.
32313823,The flare-up of COVID-19, it has already been infected 78,811 people with 2462 fatalities in 1 month window.
32313823,The most alarming issue is the virus can transmit from host to host and still asymptomatic.
32313823,Currently, 24 counties with 505 confirmed cases have been reported.
32313823,Presently, there is no specific treatment or vaccine but physicians are battling with the use of antibiotics, steroid, anti-viral and anti-HIV drugs and some of the infected cases are testified improved.
32313823,WHO and China National health Commission are cooperatively striving to come up with elucidation but it will take a minimum of 3 to 4 months at least to undergo a phase-1 trial.
32313823,However, the soaring rates of spreading each day has become much stable which might even improve within the next few weeks in China but not for some other countries.
32313823,Healthy peoples are instructed to avoid public gathering, always wearing the mask and frequently wash hands.
32313823,Currently, China has able to hold up more than 97.7% infection within China but a scientific breakthrough is crucial before it's too late.
32313824,The present outbreak associated with corona virus [CoVs] in China which is believed to be one of the massive eruptions towards mankind in 2019-2020.
32313824,In the present scenario CoVs has been transmitted to the European and American regions through the travellers from wide spread countries like China and Japan.
32313824,The viral disease is spreading through the contact in any form by the infected persons or patients and creating huge risk of mortality.
32313824,CoVs are a single positive-sense RNA virus; mutation rates are higher than DNA viruses and indicate a more effective survival adaption mechanism.
32313824,Human CoVs can cause common cold and influenza-like illness and a variety of severe acute respiratory disease such as pneumonia.
32313824,Early in infection, CoVs infects epithelial cells, macrophages, T-cells, dendritic cells and also can affect the development and implantation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines.
32313824,It mainly produces the melanoma differentiation associated with protein-5, retinoic acid inducible gene-1 and endosomal toll-like receptor 3.
32313824,How CoVs affects the function of the immune system is still unclear due to lack of this knowledge.
32313824,No Food and Drug Administration approved treatment is available till date.
32313824,In this review, we are tried to explore the epidemiology, pathogenesis and current treatment of CoVs infection.
32313824,The promising therapeutics molecules against CoVs and future prospective have been also discussed which will be helpful for researchers to find out the new molecules for the treatment of CoVs disease.
32313873,The novel Coronavirus (CoVid-19) outbreak is now consider a world pandemic, affecting more than 1,300,000 people worldwide.
32313873,Cancer patients are in risk for severe disease, including a higher risk of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, need for invasive ventilation or death.
32313873,Management of patients with lymphoid malignancies can be challenging during the outbreak, due to need of multiple hospital visits and admissions, immunosuppression and need for chemotherapy, radiotherapy and stem cell transplantation.
32313873,In this article, we will focus on the practical management of patients with lymphoid malignancies during the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on minimizing the risk for patients.
32313880,PAK1 (RAC/CDC42-activated kinase 1) is the major &quot;pathogenic&quot; kinase whose abnormal activation causes a wide variety of diseases/disorders including cancers, inflammation, malaria and pandemic viral infection including influenza, HIV and COVID-19.
32313880,Since Louis Pateur who developed a vaccine against rabies in 1885, in general a series of &quot;specific&quot; vaccines have been used for treatment of viral infection, mainly because antibiotics in general are ineffective for treatment of viral infection.
32313880,However, it takes 12-18 months till the effective vaccine becomes available.
32313880,Until then ventilator (O<sub>2</sub> supplier) would be the most common tool for saving the life of COVID-19 patients.
32313880,Thus, as alternative potentially more direct &quot;broad-spectrum&quot; COVID-19 therapeutics, several natural and synthetic PAK1-blockers such as propolis, melatonin, ciclesonide, hydroxy chloroquine (HQ), ivermection, and ketorolac, which are readily available in the market, are introduced here.
32313883,The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway senses and responds to nutrient availability, energy sufficiency, stress, hormones and mitogens to modulate protein synthesis.
32313883,Rapamycin is a bacterial product that can inhibit mTOR via the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. mTOR signaling is necessary for the development of influenza and modulates the antibody response to provide cross-protective immunity to lethal infection with influenza virus.
32313883,In one human study, it was found that the treatment of severe H1N1 influenza‑related pneumonia with rapamycin and steroids improved the outcome.
32313883,However, in other studies, immunosuppression with systemic steroids, and possibly rapamycin as well, was associated with an increased morbidity/mortality and a prolonged viral replication.
32313883,In order to avoid the systemic side-effects, some investigators have postulated that the inhalation of rapamycin would be desirable.
32313883,However, the inhalation of rapamycin, with its well-documented lung toxicity, could be contraindicated.
32313883,Another class of drug, biguanides, can also inhibit mTOR, but have no lung toxicity.
32313883,Biguanides are widely used small molecule drugs prescribed as oral anti-diabetics that have exhibited considerable promise in oncology.
32313883,During the 1971 outbreak of influenza, diabetic patients treated with the biguanides, phenformin and buformin, had a lower incidence of infection than diabetics treated with sulfonylureas or insulin.
32313883,Both buformin and phenformin reduce the mortality of influenza in mice; phenformin is less effective than buformin.
32313883,The inhalation of buformin or phenformin for influenza may be an effective novel treatment strategy that would limit the risk of systemic side-effects associated with biguanides due to the low inhaled dose.
32313883,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, a virus closely related to the SARS virus.
32313883,The disease is the cause of the 2019-2020 coronavirus outbreak.
32313883,It is primarily spread between individuals via small droplets emitted from infected individuals when breathing or coughing.
32313883,PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling responses play important roles in MERS-CoV infection and may represent a novel drug target for therapeutic intervention strategies.
32313883,The present review article discusses the effects of biguanides on influenza and coronavirus.
32313885,The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a proliferation of clinical trials that are designed to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
32313885,The overwhelming majority of cardiovascular and cancer patients are at increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection; accordingly, the cardiovascular and cardio-oncology communities are playing a major role in caring for COVID-19 patients.
32313885,Many of the therapeutic agents that are being used to treat patients with COVID-19 are repurposed treatments for influenza, drugs that were not effective in Ebola patients, or treatments for malaria that were developed decades ago, and are unlikely to be familiar to the cardiovascular and cardio-oncology communities.
32313885,Here we have provided a foundation for cardiovascular and cardio-oncology physicians who are on the frontline providing care to COVID-19 patients, so that they can better understand the emerging cardiovascular epidemiology of COVID-19, as well as the biological rationale for the clinical trials that are ongoing for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.
32314010,In December 2019, numerous coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases were reported in Wuhan, China, which has since spread throughout the world.
32314010,However, its impact on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients is unknown.
32314010,Herein, we report a case of COVID-19 pneumonia in a 61-year-old female RA patient who was receiving conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (cDMARDs).
32314010,The patient presented with a 4-day history of myalgia and febrile sensation.
32314010,COVID-19 was confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
32314010,Chest X-ray showed increased opacity on the right lower lung area, and C-reactive protein level was slightly elevated.
32314010,The patient was treated with antiviral agents (lopinavir/ritonavir), and treatment with cDMARDs was discontinued except hydroxychloroquine.
32314010,Her symptoms and laboratory results gradually improved.
32314010,Three weeks later, real-time PCR for COVID-19 showed negative conversion, and the patient was discharged without any complications.
32314034,The Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak is rapidly emerging as a global health threat.
32314034,With no proven vaccination or treatment, infection control measures are paramount.
32314034,In this article, we aim to describe the impact of COVID-19 on our practice and share our strategies and guidelines to maintain a sustainable ophthalmology practice.
32314034,Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) Eye Centre is the only ophthalmology department supporting the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID), which is the national screening center and the main center for management of COVID-19 patients in Singapore.
32314034,Our guidelines during this outbreak are discussed.
32314034,Challenges in different care settings in our ophthalmology practice have been identified and analyzed with practical solutions and guidelines implemented in anticipation of these challenges.
32314034,First, to minimize cross-infection of COVID-19, stringent infection control measures were set up.
32314034,These include personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare workers and routine cleaning of &quot;high-touch&quot; surfaces.
32314034,Second, for outpatient care, a stringent dual screening and triaging process were carried out to identify high-risk patients, with proper isolation for such patients.
32314034,Administrative measures to lower patient attendance and reschedule appointments were carried out.
32314034,Third, inpatient and outpatient care were separated to minimize interactions.
32314034,Last but not least, logistics and manpower plans were drawn up in anticipation of resource demands and measures to improve the mental well-being of staff were implemented.
32314034,We hope our measures during this COVID-19 pandemic can help ophthalmologists globally and serve to guide and maintain safe access in ophthalmology clinics when faced with similar disease outbreaks.
32314081,The COVID-19 pandemic has focused attention on issues of epidemiology, public health, and vaccine design.
32314081,I submit that attention to COVID-19 pharmacologic therapy needs similar emphasis, including identifying any existing medications that can be repurposed to treat COVID-19 patients.
32314460,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new coronavirus responsible for the pandemic named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32314460,The disease causes SARS with a significant morbidity and mortality.
32314460,We provide a review with a focus on COVID-19 in dermatology.
32314460,We discuss triage of suspected infectious patients, protection of medical doctors and nurses.
32314460,We discuss the available data on cutaneous symptoms, although disease-specific symptoms have yet not been observed.
32314460,COVID-19 is a challenge for the treatment of dermatologic patients, either with severe inflammatory disorders or with skin cancer.
32314460,The consequences for systemic treatment are obvious but it will be most important to collect the clinical data for a better decision process.
32314460,Last but not least, education in dermatology for students will not be temporarily possible in the classical settings.
32314460,COVID-19, although not a skin disease, by itself has an immense impact on dermatology.
32314483,The new coronavirus pandemic poses question and challenges for dermatologists.
32314483,One of question is if psoriasis patients treated with immunomodulating and immunosuppressive drugs have to discontinue their treatment in the midst of fears for the infection and its consequences.
32314483,One of the challenges is how can we support our patients in this critical time.
32314483,Previous coronaviruses outbreaks reports, current published evidences on pathogenesis and on clinical reports of COVID infection in immunosuppressed patients are used to make a scientifically based decision.
32314503,Evidence has lately emerged regarding an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 with worse prognosis in patients with obesity, especially among the young.
32314503,Weight excess is a well-established respiratory disease risk factor, and the newly reported correlation is therefore unsurprising.
32314503,The underlying pathophysiology is likely multi-stranded, ranging from complement system hyperactivation, increased Interleukin-6 secretion, chronic inflammation, presence of comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension, and a possible local, detrimental effect within the lung.
32314503,Further understanding the link between obesity and SARS-CoV-2 is crucial, as this could aid proper tailoring of immunomodulatory treatments, together with improving stratification among those possibly requiring critical care.

32314698,Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has been used for the treatment of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases.
32314698,However, evidence of efficacy remains limited, and adverse events can be associated with its use.
32314698,Here, we report a case of a patient with severe COVID-19 who, after being administered HCQ, exhibited a 10-fold increase in serum levels of transaminases, followed by a rapid decrease after HCQ was withdrawn.
32314698,Considering the significantly increased use of HCQ during the COVID-19 pandemic, this case alerts us to the potential for HCQ to be associated with hepatotoxicity and the need to monitor liver function during HCQ therapy.
32314799,Tocilizumab is an interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor antibody and is progressing as a viable and promising treatment option in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32314799,IL-6 is known to have both immunomodulatory and metabolic actions.
32314799,In this letter we outline two cases of acute hypertriglyceridemia in patients with COVID-19 treated with tocilizumab: one with elevated biomarkers consistent with acute pancreatitis the other without.
32314799,Given the paucity of robust clinical trial data for most COVID-19 pharmacotherapies at this time, clinicians should continue to remain steadfast in recognition of interventions that improve clinical outcomes and vigilant in monitoring for acute adverse effects that are difficult to detect in clinical trials with small sample sizes.
32314799,The observations from our two cases highlight the complex, not fully elucidated interrelationship between elevated IL-6 and pharmacologic interventions impacting this pathway.
32314799,Clinicians should consider monitoring for hypertriglyceridemia and acute pancreatitis as described with chronic tocilizumab use for rheumatoid arthritis in those receiving it for COVID-19.

32314850,There is a growing appreciation that the regulation of the melatonergic pathways, both pineal and systemic, may be an important aspect in how viruses drive the cellular changes that underpin their control of cellular function.
32314850,We review the melatonergic pathway role in viral infections, emphasizing influenza and covid-19 infections.
32314850,Viral, or preexistent, suppression of pineal melatonin disinhibits neutrophil attraction, thereby contributing to an initial &quot;cytokine storm&quot;, as well as the regulation of other immune cells.
32314850,Melatonin induces the circadian gene, Bmal1, which disinhibits the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC), countering viral inhibition of Bmal1/PDC.
32314850,PDC drives mitochondrial conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), thereby increasing the tricarboxylic acid cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and ATP production.
32314850,Pineal melatonin suppression attenuates this, preventing the circadian &quot;resetting&quot; of mitochondrial metabolism.
32314850,This is especially relevant in immune cells, where shifting metabolism from glycolytic to oxidative phosphorylation, switches cells from reactive to quiescent phenotypes.
32314850,Acetyl-CoA is a necessary cosubstrate for arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase, providing an acetyl group to serotonin, and thereby initiating the melatonergic pathway.
32314850,Consequently, pineal melatonin regulates mitochondrial melatonin and immune cell phenotype.
32314850,Virus- and cytokine-storm-driven control of the pineal and mitochondrial melatonergic pathway therefore regulates immune responses.
32314850,Virus-and cytokine storm-driven changes also increase gut permeability and dysbiosis, thereby suppressing levels of the short-chain fatty acid, butyrate, and increasing circulating lipopolysaccharide (LPS).
32314850,The alterations in butyrate and LPS can promote viral replication and host symptom severity via impacts on the melatonergic pathway.
32314850,Focussing on immune regulators has treatment implications for covid-19 and other viral infections.
32314951,We highlight the critical roles that pharmacists have related to sustaining and advancing the changes being made in the face of the current COVID-19 pandemic to ensure that patients have more seamless and less complex access to treatment.
32314951,Discussed herein is how the current COVID-19 pandemic is impacting persons with substance use disorders, barriers that persist, and the opportunities that arise as regulations around treatments for this population are eased.
32315171,The recent outbreak of novel coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) calls for and welcomes possible treatment strategies using drugs on the market.
32315171,It is very efficient to apply computer-aided drug design techniques to quickly identify promising drug repurposing candidates, especially after the detailed 3D structures of key viral proteins are resolved.
32315171,The virus causing COVID-19 is SARS-CoV-2.
32315171,Taking advantage of a recently released crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 main protease in complex with a covalently bonded inhibitor, N3 (Liu et al., 10.2210/pdb6LU7/pdb), I conducted virtual docking screening of approved drugs and drug candidates in clinical trials.
32315171,For the top docking hits, I then performed molecular dynamics simulations followed by binding free energy calculations using an end point method called MM-PBSA-WSAS (molecular mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann surface area/weighted solvent-accessible surface area; Wang, <i>Chem.
32315171,Rev.</i> 2019, 119, 9478; Wang, <i>Curr.

32315171,Model.</i>, 2012, 52, 1199).
32315171,Several promising known drugs stand out as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 main protease, including carfilzomib, eravacycline, valrubicin, lopinavir, and elbasvir.
32315171,Carfilzomib, an approved anticancer drug acting as a proteasome inhibitor, has the best MM-PBSA-WSAS binding free energy, -13.8 kcal/mol.
32315171,The second-best repurposing drug candidate, eravacycline, is synthetic halogenated tetracycline class antibiotic.
32315171,Streptomycin, another antibiotic and a charged molecule, also demonstrates some inhibitory effect, even though the predicted binding free energy of the charged form (-3.8 kcal/mol) is not nearly as low as that of the neutral form (-7.9 kcal/mol).
32315171,One bioactive, PubChem 23727975, has a binding free energy of -12.9 kcal/mol.
32315171,Detailed receptor-ligand interactions were analyzed and hot spots for the receptor-ligand binding were identified.
32315171,I found that one hot spot residue, His41, is a conserved residue across many viruses including SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and hepatitis C virus (HCV).
32315171,The findings of this study can facilitate rational drug design targeting the SARS-CoV-2 main protease.
32315386,Common symptoms of pandemic coronavirus disease (COVID-19) include fever and cough.
32315386,We describe a 94-year-old man with well-controlled schizoaffective disorder, who presented with non-specific and atypical symptoms: delirium, low-grade pyrexia and abdominal pain.
32315386,He was given antibiotics for infection of unknown source, subsequently refined to treatment for community-acquired pneumonia.
32315386,Despite active treatment, he deteriorated with oxygen desaturation and tachypnoea.
32315386,A repeat chest X-ray showed widespread opacification.
32315386,A postmortem throat swab identified COVID-19 infection.
32315386,He was treated in three wards over 5 days with no infection control precautions.
32315386,This has implications for the screening, assessment and isolation of frail older people to COVID-specific clinical facilities and highlights the potential for spread among healthcare professionals and other patients.
32315487,In this study we report on the clinical and autoimmune characteristics of severe and critical novel coronavirus pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32315487,The clinical, autoimmune, and laboratory characteristics of 21 patients who had laboratory-confirmed severe and critical cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from the intensive care unit of the Huangshi Central Hospital, Hubei Province, China, were investigated.
32315487,A total of 21 patients (13 men and 8 women), including 8 (38.1%) severe cases and 13 (61.9%) critical cases, were enrolled.
32315487,Cough (90.5%) and fever (81.0%) were the dominant symptoms, and most patients (76.2%) had at least one coexisting disorder on admission.
32315487,The most common characteristics on chest computed tomography were ground-glass opacity (100%) and bilateral patchy shadowing (76.2%).
32315487,The most common findings on laboratory measurement were lymphocytopenia (85.7%) and elevated levels of C-reactive protein (94.7%) and interleukin-6 (89.5%).
32315487,The prevalence of anti-52 kDa SSA/Ro antibody, anti-60 kDa SSA/Ro antibody, and antinuclear antibody was 20%, 25%, and 50%, respectively.
32315487,We also retrospectively analyzed the clinical and laboratory data from 21 severe and critical cases of COVID-19.
32315487,Autoimmune phenomena exist in COVID-19 subjects, and the present results provide the rationale for a strategy of preventing immune dysfunction and optimal immunosuppressive therapy.
32315614,Novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is highly infectious and requires early detection, isolation, and treatment.
32315614,We tried to find some useful information by analyzing the covid-19 screening data, so as to provide help for clinical practice.
32315614,We collected nucleic acid and hematology data from 2510 patients for COVID-19 infection for retrospective analysis.
32315614,COVID-19 and influenza A and B infection rates were 1.3%, 3%, and 3%, respectively.
32315614,COVID-19 nucleic acid was detected in stool but not in tear samples from 8 positive patients.
32315614,Among the 32 patients with COVID-19, 15 (47%) and 16 (50%) patients showed decreased lymphocyte count and lymphocyte ratio, 21(66%) and 24(75%) patients showed decreased eosinophil count and eosinophil ratio, and 18 (56%) patients showed increased C-reactive protein.
32315614,Ten hematological indicators significantly differed in the blood of patients with COVID-19 and those with influenza A and B (P &lt; 0.05).
32315614,Eighteen hematological indicators significantly differed between patients with COVID-19 and negative patients (P &lt; 0.05).
32315614,The positive rate of influenza A and B infection was higher than that of COVID-19.
32315614,When pharyngeal swab collection may cause infection, fecal samples can be examined.
32315614,Evaluation of pharyngeal swab and fecal samples can improve the positive rate of nucleic acid detection.
32315614,The COVID-19 can cause some hematological indices changes.
32315723,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and represents a potentially fatal disease of great global public health importance.
32315723,As of March 26, 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 has resulted in 462,801 confirmed cases and 20,839 deaths globally, which is more than those caused by SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2003 and 2013, respectively.
32315723,The epidemic has posed considerable challenges worldwide.
32315723,Under a strict mechanism of massive prevention and control, China has seen a rapid decrease in new cases of coronavirus; however, the global situation remains serious.
32315723,Additionally, the origin of COVID-19 has not been determined and no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine is currently available.
32315723,Based on the published data, this review systematically discusses the etiology, epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and current intervention measures related to COVID-19 in the hope that it may provide a reference for future studies and aid in the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic.
32315725,An ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 has exhibited significant threats around the world.
32315725,We found a significant decrease of T lymphocyte subsets and an increase of inflammatory cytokines of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in clinical practice.
32315725,We conducted a retrospective, single-center observational study of in-hospital adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Hubei Provincial Hospital of traditional Chinese and Western medicine (Wuhan, China) by Mar 1, 2020.
32315725,Demographic, clinical, laboratory information, especially T lymphocyte subsets and inflammatory cytokines were reported.
32315725,For patients who died or discharge from hospital, the associations of T lymphocyte subsets on admission were evaluated by univariate logistic regression with odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), warning values to predict in-hospital death were assessed by Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curves.
32315725,A total of 187 patients were enrolled in our study from Dec 26, 2019 to Mar 1, 2020, of whom 145 were survivors (discharge = 117) or non-survivors (in-hospital death ==28).
32315725,All patients exhibited a significant drop of T lymphocyte subsets counts with remarkably increasing concentrations of SAA, CRP, IL-6, and IL-10 compared to normal values.
32315725,The median concentrations of SAA and CRP in critically-ill patients were nearly 4- and 10-fold than those of mild-ill patients, respectively.
32315725,As the severity of COVID-19 getting worse, the counts of T lymphocyte drop lower.28 patients died in hospital, the median lymphocyte, CD3+ T-cell, CD4+ T-cell, CD8+ T-cell and B-cell were significantly lower than other patients.
32315725,Lower counts (/uL) of T lymphocyte subsets lymphocyte (&lt;500), CD3+T-cell (&lt;200), CD4+ T-cell (&lt;100), CD8+ T-cell (&lt;100) and B-cell (&lt;50) were associated with higher risks of in-hospital death of CIVID-19.
32315725,The warning values to predict in-hospital death of lymphocyte, CD3+ T-cell, CD4+ T-cell, CD8+ T-cell, and B-cell were 559, 235, 104, 85 and 82, respectively.
32315725,We find a significant decrease of T lymphocyte subset is positively correlated with in-hospital death and severity of illness.
32315725,The decreased levels of T lymphocyte subsets reported in our study were similar with SARS but not common among other virus infection, which may be possible biomarkers for early diagnosis of COVID-19.
32315725,Our findings may shed light on early warning of high risks of mortality and help early intervention and treatment of COVID-19.
32315817,Since being first reported in Wuhan, China, in December 8, 2019, the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, now known as COVID-19, has spread globally.
32315817,Some case studies regarding the characteristics and outcome of patients with COVID-19 have been published recently.
32315817,We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the risk factors of COVID-19.
32315817,Medline, SinoMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library were searched for clinical and epidemiological studies on confirmed cases of COVID-19.
32315817,The incidence of fever, cough, fatigue, and dyspnea symptoms were 85.6 % (95CI 81.3-89.9 %), 65.7 % (95CI 60.1-71.4 %), 42.4 % (95CI 32.2-52.6 %) and 21.4 % (95CI 15.3-27.5 %).
32315817,The prevalence of diabetes was 7.7 % (95CI 6.1-9.3 %), hypertension was 15.6 % (95CI 12.6-18.6 %), cardiovascular disease was 4.7 % (95CI 3.1-6.2 %), and malignancy was 1.2 % (95CI 0.5-1.8 %).
32315817,The complications, including ARDS risk, ranged from 5.6-13.2 %, with the pooled estimate of ARDS risk at 9.4 %, ACI at 5.8 % (95CI 0.7-10.8 %), AKI at 2.1 % (95CI 0.6-3.7 %), and shock at 4.7 % (95CI 0.9-8.6 %).
32315817,The risks of severity and mortality ranged from 12.6 to 23.5% and from 2.0 to 4.4 %, with pooled estimates at 18.0 and 3.2 %, respectively.
32315817,The percentage of critical cases in diabetes and hypertension was 44.5 % (95CI 27.0-61.9 %) and 41.7 % (95CI 26.4-56.9 %), respectively.
32315817,Fever is the most common symptom in patients with COVID-19.
32315817,The most prevalent comorbidities are hypertension and diabetes which are associated with the severity of COVID-19.
32315817,ARDS and ACI may be the main obstacles for patients to treatment recovery.
32315817,The case severe rate and mortality is lower than that of SARS and MERS.
32315874,The COVID-19 pandemic will likely lead to high rates of PTSD, depression, and substance misuse among survivors, victims' families, medical workers, and other essential personnel.
32315874,The mental health response to the 9/11/01 terrorist attacks, culminating in a federally-funded health program, provides a template for how providers may serve affected individuals.
32315874,Drawing on the 9/11 experience, we highlight effective prevention measures, likely short and long-term treatment needs, vulnerable subgroups, and important points of divergence between 9/11 and the COVID-19 pandemic.
32315874,Mental health monitoring, early identification of at-risk individuals, and treatment irrespective of financial barriers are essential for minimizing chronic distress.
32315907,In view of the current situation regarding the Covid-19 disease, a discussion is proposed on the need for research focusing on the presence and evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in water, soils and other environmental compartments, reached through wastewater and sewage sludge spreading.
32315907,Also, the evaluation of current treatments for wastewater and sewage sludge, as well as the eventual development of new specific techniques, based on sorption, nanotechnology, etc., would be of great interest for controlling the environmental dissemination of these viruses in the current and eventual future outbreaks.
32315948,A type 1 diabetes patient experienced remission associated with chloroquine therapy while travelling to a malaria-endemic area.
32315948,Chloroquine has immunomodulatory and hypoglycaemic effects and may become more frequently used due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
32315948,Patients with type 1 diabetes treated with chloroquine should be monitored for hypoglycaemia, even after recovery.
32315963,The world is experiencing pandemic of the COVID-19 now, a RNA virus that spread out from Wuhan, China.
32315963,Two countries, China first and later Italy, have gone to full lock down due to rapid spread of this virus.
32315963,Till to date, no epidemiological data on mental health problems due to outbreak of the COVID-19 and mass isolation were not available.
32315963,To meet this need, the present study was undertaken to assess the mental health status of Chinese people.
32315963,An online survey was conducted on a sample of 1074 Chinese people, majority of whom from Hubei province.
32315963,Lack of adequate opportunities to conduct face to face interview, anxiety, depression, mental well-being and alcohol consumption behavior were assessed via self-reported measures.
32315963,Results showed higher rate of anxiety, depression, hazardous and harmful alcohol use, and lower mental wellbeing than usual ratio.
32315963,Results also revealed that young people aged 21-40 years are in more vulnerable position in terms of their mental health conditions and alcohol use.
32315963,To address mental health crisis during this epidemic, it is high time to implement multi-faceted approach (i.e. forming multidisciplinary mental health team, providing psychiatric treatments and other mental health services, utilizing online counseling platforms, rehabilitation program, ensuring certain care for vulnerable groups, etc.).
32315980,Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is a novel disease entity that is spreading throughout the world.
32315980,It has been speculated that patients with comorbidities and elderly patients could be at high risk for respiratory insufficiency and death.
32315980,Immunosuppression could expose infected patients to even higher risks of disease complications due to dampened immune response.
32315980,However, it has been speculated that overactive immune response could drive clinical deterioration and, based on this hypothesis, several immunosuppressants are currently being tested as potential treatment for COVID-19.
32315980,In this paper we report on a patient that has been treated with ocrelizumab (a B-cell depleting monoclonal antibody) for primary progressive multiple sclerosis who developed COVID-19.
32315980,Despite complete B cell depletion, patient symptoms abated few days after hospitalization, and he was discharged to home-quarantine.
32315980,Phone interview follow-up confirmed that, after 14 days, no new symptoms occurred.
32315980,This report supports the putative role of immunosuppressive therapy in COVID-19 affected patients.
32316065,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a global pandemic in just a few months, causing millions infected.
32316065,Nearly 20% of COVID-19 patients present severe coagulation abnormalities, which may occur in almost all of the severe and critical ill COVID-19 cases.
32316065,Concomitant venous thromboembolism (VTE), a potential cause of unexplained deaths, has been frequently reported in COVID-19 cases, but its management is still challenging due to the complexity between antithrombotic therapy and coagulation disorders.
32316065,Based on frontline practical experience and comprehensive literature review, here a panel of experts and physicians from China and Europe developed an evidence and opinion-based consensus on the prophylaxis and management of VTE associated with COVID-19.
32316065,This statement aims for clinicians treating COVID-19 and provides practical recommendations in detailed situations, for example, how to choose thromboprophylactic measures for patients with diverse severity of disease and bleeding risk, or which kind of anticoagulant should be prescribed.
32316065,With limited experience on COVID19-associated VTE, this expert consensus statement should be helpful for clinicians worldwide with specific suggestions.
32316118,In the current work, we discovered and analyzed the epidemiological paradox between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and malaria in the initial phase of the ongoing pandemic.
32316118,From the analysis of distribution data, the endemic presence of malaria seems to protect some populations from COVID-19 outbreak, particularly in the least developed countries.
32316118,In this sense, molecular and genetic variations associated with malaria (e.g., in ACE2) might play a protective role against coronavirus infection.
32316118,Moreover, the mechanism of action of some antimalarial drugs, e.g., the antiviral function, suggests their potential role in the chemoprophylaxis of coronavirus epidemics, despite possible adverse effects (e.g., retinal toxicity).
32316118,All these data provide important insights to understand the spreading mechanisms of COVID-19, and to direct scientific research toward the study of some currently available medications.
32316233,Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency screening test is essential for malaria treatment, control, and elimination programs.
32316233,G6PD deficient individuals are at high risk of severe hemolysis when given anti-malarial drugs such as primaquine, quinine, other sulphonamide-containing medicines, and chloroquine, which has recently been shown to be potent for the treatment of coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
32316233,We evaluated the geographical accessibility to POC testing for G6PD deficiency in Ghana, a malaria-endemic country.
32316233,We obtained the geographic information of 100 randomly sampled clinics previously included in a cross-sectional survey.
32316233,We also obtained the geolocated data of all public hospitals providing G6PD deficiency testing services in the region.
32316233,Using ArcGIS 10.5, we quantified geographical access to G6PD deficiency screening test and identified clinics as well as visualize locations with poor access for targeted improvement.
32316233,The travel time was estimated using an assumed speed of 20 km per hour.
32316233,Of the 100 clinics, 58% were Community-based Health Planning and Services facilities, and 42% were sub-district health centers.
32316233,The majority (92%) were Ghana Health Service facilities, and the remaining 8% were Christian Health Association of Ghana facilities.
32316233,Access to G6PD deficiency screening test was varied across the districts, and G6PD deficiency screening test was available in all eight public hospitals.
32316233,This implies that the health facility-to-population ratio for G6PD deficiency testing service was approximately 1:159,210 (8/1,273,677) population.
32316233,The spatial analysis quantified the current mean distance to a G6PD deficiency testing service from all locations in the region to be 34 ± 14 km, and travel time (68 ± 27 min).
32316233,The estimated mean distance from a clinic to a district hospital for G6PD deficiency testing services was 15 ± 11 km, and travel time (46 ± 33 min).
32316233,Access to POC testing for G6PD deficiency in Ghana was poor.
32316233,Given the challenges associated with G6PD deficiency, it would be essential to improve access to G6PD deficiency POC testing to facilitate administration of sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine to pregnant women, full implementation of the malaria control program in Ghana, and treatment of COVID-19 patients with chloroquine in malaria-endemic countries.
32316233,To enable the World Health Organization include appropriate G6PD POC diagnostic tests in its list of essential in-vitro diagnostics for use in resource-limited settings, we recommend a wider evaluation of available POC diagnostic tests for G6PD deficiency, particularly in malaria-endemic countries.
32316618,Since December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in devastating consequences worldwide and infected more than 350,000 individuals and killed more than 16,000 people.
32316618,SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh member of the coronavirus family to affect humans.
32316618,Symptoms of COVID-19 include fever (88%), cough (68%), vomiting (5%) and diarrhoea (3.7%), and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is thought to occur from human to human via respiratory secretions released by the infected individuals when coughing and sneezing.
32316618,COVID-19 can be detected through computed tomography scans and confirmed through molecular diagnostics tools such as polymerase chain reaction.
32316618,Currently, there are no effective treatments against SARS-CoV-2, hence antiviral drugs have been used to reduce the development of respiratory complications by reducing viral load.
32316618,The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive update on the pathogenesis, clinical aspects, diagnosis, challenges and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections.
32316712,With the rapid spread of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) worldwide and the escalation of prevention and control efforts, the routine medical needs of patients have been restricted.
32316712,The aims were to investigate medical needs of lung cancer patients and their mental health status during the epidemic periods, so as to provide rational recommendations for subsequent diagnosis and treatment.
32316712,The questionnaire was sent in the form of an electronic questionnaire at 7am on 4th, March, 2020, until 7am 6th, March, 2020, 368 questionnaires were recollected from 25 provinces (autonomous regions/municipalities) in 48 h.
32316712,Of the 368 patients, 18 patients were excluded as they didn't receive anti-tumor treatment, and 350 patients were included in the final analysis. 229 cases were treated with oral targeted drugs, and 121 cases were treated with chemotherapy or immunotherapy.
32316712,41.3% of patients treated with intravenous chemotherapy or immunotherapy experienced treatment discontinuation, and the proportion of treatment discontinuation in chemotherapy or immunotherapy was higher than those treated with oral targeted drugs (21.0%).
32316712,Whether oral targeted drugs or intravenous chemotherapy or immunotherapy, more than 60% of patients experienced delays in imaging examinations.
32316712,Nearly one third of patients developed new symptoms or exacerbation of existing symptoms.
32316712,26.6%-28.9% of patients have changed their treatment plans through online consultation.
32316712,During novel coronavirus pneumonia, 40%-75% of lung cancer patients have mental health problems, and more than 95% of patients support government's prevention and control measures.
32316712,During the emergence of NCP, the medical needs of patients with lung cancer have not been enough, especially those who discontinued chemotherapy or immunotherapy.
32316712,When medical institution resumes work, priority should be given to them.
32316712,At the same time, mental health problems of patients should be valued and resolved timely.
32316712,【中文题目：优化解决肺癌患者在新型冠状病毒肺炎疫情期间诊疗问题及心理问题的探索】 【中文摘要：背景与目的 随着新冠肺炎（novel coronavirus pneumonia, NCP）在全世界范围内的迅速蔓延及防控工作的升级，肺癌患者常规诊疗需求因疫情原因受到不同程度的限制，有必要了解肺癌患者在疫情期间诊疗需求及心理健康情况，为后续的诊疗提供合理化建议。

32316718,The outbreak of Covid-19 epidemics has challenged the provision of health care worldwide, highlighting the main flaws of some national health systems with respect to their capacity to cope with the needs of frail subjects.
32316718,People experiencing disability due to Covid-19 express specific rehabilitation needs that deserve a systematic evidence-based approach.
32316718,To provide the rehabilitation community with updates on the latest scientific literature on rehabilitation needs due to Covid-19.
32316718,The first rapid &quot;living&quot; review will present the results of a systematic search performed up to March 31st, 2020.
32316718,A systematic search on PubMed, Pedro and Google Scholar was performed using the search terms: &quot;Covid-19&quot;, &quot;Coronavirus&quot;, &quot;severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2&quot;, &quot;rehabilitation&quot;, &quot;physical therapy modalities&quot;, &quot;exercise&quot;, &quot;occupational therapy&quot;, and &quot;late complications&quot;.
32316718,Papers published up to March 31st, 2020, in English, were included.
32316718,Out of the 2758 articles retrieved, 9 were included in the present review.
32316718,Four of them are &quot;calls for action&quot;, 3 provide recommendations about rehabilitation interventions in the acute phase, 2 address the needs of people quarantined at home or with restricted mobility due to the lockdown, and 1 provides a Core Outcome Set to be used in clinical trials to test the efficacy of health strategies in managing Covid-19 patients.
32316718,All selected papers were based on previous literature and not on the current Covid-19 pandemic.
32316718,Main messages included: 1) early rehabilitation should be granted to inpatients with Covid-19; 2) people with restricted mobility due to quarantine or lockdown should receive exercise programs to reduce the risk of frailty, sarcopenia, cognitive decline and depression; 3) telerehabilitation may represent the first option for people at home.
32316718,Further updates are warranted in order to characterize the emerging disability in Covid-19 survivors and the adverse effects on the health of chronically disabled people.
32316751,There have been three major global outbreaks of acute respiratory disease caused by coronavirus in the last two decades.
32316751,The ongoing Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) first emerged in Wuhan, China, is the most dangerous, which spread to 163 countries and 6 continents and caused a major public health emergency worldwide.
32316751,The outbreak is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) originated from bats, which spreads rapidly from human to human.
32316751,As of 17 March 2020, there have been 179,112 confirmed cases and 7426 deaths worldwide, with a mortality rate of 4.1%.
32316751,There is currently no effective treatment or approved vaccine, so isolating the source of infection and blocking the routes of transmission is important.
32316751,In this article, we summarized the worldwide epidemic trend of COVID-19 and discussed its epidemiological characteristics, prevention and control measures.
32316751,We hope this article could provide experience and help for global epidemic prevention and control.
32316872,Data on COVID-19 supports targeted social distancing could be an effective way to reduce morbidity and mortality, but could inadvertently increase stigma for affected populations.
32316872,As health care providers we must be aware of the facts of COVID-19, cultural implications, and potential for stigmatization of populations affected by COVID-2019.
32316872,It is important to consider the real economic impact related to lost workdays due to quarantine and social isolation efforts as well as travel restrictions that may negatively impact access to care and ability to pay for care.
32316872,Efforts geared towards general education about the disease and the rationale for quarantine and public health information provided to the general public can reduce stigmatization.
32316872,Countries who are successful at aggressive screening, early identification, patient isolation, contact tracing, quarantine, and infection control methods should also address the risk of stigmatization among populations and the negative effects which could occur.
32316872,The cases of COVID-19 will continue to rise and the virus will be sustainable for future infections.
32316872,Timely and appropriate public health interventions addressing cultural impact and risk for stigmatization along with proper screening, treatment, and follow up for affected individuals and close contacts can reduce the number of infections, serious illness, and deaths.
32317153,The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus that was first detected at the end of December 2019.
32317153,The epidemic has affected various regions of China in different degrees.
32317153,As the situations evolve, the COVID-19 had been confirmed in many countries, and made a assessment that it can be characterized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020.
32317153,Drugs are the main treatment of COVID-19 patients.
32317153,Pharmaceutical service offers drug safety ensurance for COVID-19 patients.
32317153,According to COVID-19 prevention and control policy and requirements, combined with series of diagnosis and treatment plans, pharmacists in the first provincial-level COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment unit in Jilin Province in Northeast China have established the management practices of drug supply and pharmaceutical care from four aspects: personnel, drugs supply management, off-label drug use management and pharmaceutical care.
32317153,During the outbreak, the pharmaceutical department of THJU completed its assigned workload to ensure drug supply.
32317153,So far, no nosocomial infections and medication errors have occurred, which has stabilized the mood of the staff and boosted the pharmacists' confidence in fighting the epidemic.
32317153,For the treatment of COVID-19, pharmacists conducted adverse reaction monitoring and participated in the multidisciplinary consultation of COVID-19.
32317153,Up to now, the COVID-19 patients admitted to THJU have not shown any new serious adverse reactions and been cured finally.
32317153,The hospital pharmacy department timely adjusted the work mode, and the formed management practices is a powerful guarantee for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic.
32317153,This paper summarized the details and practices of drug supply and pharmaceutical services management to provide experience for the people who involving in COVID-19 prevention and contain in other abroad epidemic areas.
32317180,Previous studies on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have focused on populations with normal immunity, but lack data on immunocompromised populations.
32317180,To evaluate the clinical features and outcomes of COVID-19 pneumonia in kidney transplant recipients.
32317180,A total of 10 renal transplant recipients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia were enrolled in this retrospective study.
32317180,In addition, 10 of their family members diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia were included in the control group.
32317180,Immunosuppressant reduction and low-dose methylprednisolone therapy.
32317180,The clinical outcomes (the severity of pneumonia, recovery rate, time of virus shedding, and length of illness) were compared with the control group by statistical analysis.
32317180,The clinical symptomatic, laboratory, and radiological characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia in the renal transplant recipients were similar to those of severe COVID-19 pneumonia in the general population.
32317180,The severity of COVID-19 pneumonia was greater in the transplant recipients than in the control group (five severe/three critical cases vs one severe case).
32317180,Five patients developed transient renal allograft damage.
32317180,After a longer time of virus shedding (28.4 ± 9.3 vs 12.2 ± 4.6 d in the control group) and a longer course of illness (35.3 ± 8.3 vs 18.8 ± 10.5 d in the control group), nine of the 10 transplant patients recovered successfully after treatment.
32317180,One patient developed acute renal graft failure and died of progressive respiratory failure.
32317180,Kidney transplant recipients had more severe COVID-19 pneumonia than the general population, but most of them recovered after a prolonged clinical course and virus shedding.
32317180,Findings from this small group of cases may have important implications for the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia in immunosuppressed populations.
32317180,Immunosuppressed transplant recipients with coronavirus disease 2019 infection had more severe pneumonia, but most of them still achieved a good prognosis after appropriate treatment.
32317202,Coronavirus (COVID-19) endemic is growing exponentially in the whole world.
32317202,Researchers, technologists, doctors and other healthcare workers are working day and night on the development of vaccine and medicinesto control and treat this virus.
32317202,SARS-CoV-2 is the name of the virus responsible for causing COVID-19 disease, which is highly infectious and lethal.With exponentially increasing infections, proportionate fatalities are being reported both from developed and under developed countries.
32317202,As of today, more than one million people across the world have been reported infected with this virus, and more than 65,000 people have died of this disease.
32317202,Hence, there is an urgent requirement for conducting academic research on several aspects of this highly contagious disease, to find effective means of containment and treatment of the disease, for now, and in future.
32317202,We have identified some opportunities for academic research related to COVID-19 and have also provided suggestions to contain, prevent and treat this viral infection.
32317203,The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32317203,While systemic inflammation and pulmonary complications can result in significant morbidity and mortality, cardiovascular complications may also occur.
32317203,This brief report evaluates cardiovascular complications in the setting of COVID-19 infection.
32317203,The current COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in over one million infected worldwide and thousands of death.
32317203,The virus binds and enters through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
32317203,COVID-19 can result in systemic inflammation, multiorgan dysfunction, and critical illness.
32317203,The cardiovascular system is also affected, with complications including myocardial injury, myocarditis, acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, dysrhythmias, and venous thromboembolic events.
32317203,Current therapies for COVID-19 may interact with cardiovascular medications.
32317203,Emergency clinicians should be aware of these cardiovascular complications when evaluating and managing the patient with COVID-19.
32317205,The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a pandemic threatening global public health.
32317205,In the current paper, we describe our successful treatment of three COVID-19 pneumonia patients cases including severe cases and cases with mortality risk factors.
32317205,One 32-year-old male COVID-19 patient was diagnosed with severe COVID-19 pneumonia and moderate ARDS.
32317205,The second COVID-19 pneumonia patient had a history of diabetes and chronic bronchitis.
32317205,The third case of COVID-19 pneumonia was an 82-year old female patient.
32317205,All three cases had severe COVID pneumonia and therefore were aggressively managed with a multidisciplinary and personalized therapeutic approach that included nutritional support, antiviral pharmacotherapy, active control of comorbidities, prevention of complication development and psychological intervention.
32317205,Our experience highlights the importance of the use of a multidisciplinary therapeutic approach that tailors to the specific condition of the patient in achieving a favorable clinical outcome.
32317220,The outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has posed the world at a pandemic risk.
32317220,Coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, which causes pneumonia, requires intensive care unit hospitalization in about 10% of cases and can lead to a fatal outcome.
32317220,Several efforts are currently made to find a treatment for COVID-19 patients.
32317220,So far, several anti-viral and immunosuppressive or immunomodulating drugs have demonstrated some efficacy on COVID-19 both in vitro and in animal models as well as in cases series.
32317220,In COVID-19 patients a pro-inflammatory status with high levels of interleukin (IL)-1B, IL-1 receptor (R)A and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α has been demonstrated.
32317220,Moreover, high levels of IL-6 and TNF-α have been observed in patients requiring intensive-care-unit hospitalization.
32317220,This provided rationale for the use of anti-rheumatic drugs as potential treatments for this severe viral infection.
32317220,Other agents, such as hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine might have a direct anti-viral effect.
32317220,The anti-viral aspect of immunosuppressants towards a variety of viruses has been known since long time and it is herein discussed in the view of searching for a potential treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32317225,An ongoing outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease (coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19) has become a global threat.
32317225,While clinical reports from China to date demonstrate that the majority of cases remain relatively mild and recover with supportive care, it is also crucial to be well prepared for severe cases warranting intensive care.
32317225,Initiating appropriate infection control measures may not always be achievable in primary care or in acute-care settings.
32317225,A 45-year-old man was admitted to the intensive care unit due to severe pneumonia, later confirmed as COVID-19.
32317225,His initial evaluation in the resuscitation room and treatments in the intensive care unit was performed under droplet and contact precaution with additional airborne protection using the N95 respirator mask.
32317225,He was successfully treated in the intensive care unit with mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for respiratory support; and antiretroviral treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir.
32317225,His total intensive care unit stay was 15 days and was discharged on hospital day 24.
32317225,Strict infection control precautions are not always an easy task, especially under urgent care in an intensive care unit.
32317225,However, severe cases of COVID-19 pneumonia, or another novel infectious disease, could present at any moment and would be a continuing challenge to pursue appropriate measures.
32317225,We need to be well prepared to secure healthcare workers from exposure to infectious diseases and nosocomial spread, as well as to provide necessary intensive care.
32317267,To evaluate viral loads at different stages of disease progression in patients infected with the 2019 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) during the first four months of the epidemic in Zhejiang province, China.
32317267,Retrospective cohort study.
32317267,A designated hospital for patients with covid-19 in Zhejiang province, China. 96 consecutively admitted patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection: 22 with mild disease and 74 with severe disease.
32317267,Data were collected from 19 January 2020 to 20 March 2020.
32317267,Ribonucleic acid (RNA) viral load measured in respiratory, stool, serum, and urine samples.
32317267,Cycle threshold values, a measure of nucleic acid concentration, were plotted onto the standard curve constructed on the basis of the standard product.
32317267,Epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory characteristics and treatment and outcomes data were obtained through data collection forms from electronic medical records, and the relation between clinical data and disease severity was analysed. 3497 respiratory, stool, serum, and urine samples were collected from patients after admission and evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 RNA viral load.
32317267,Infection was confirmed in all patients by testing sputum and saliva samples.
32317267,RNA was detected in the stool of 55 (59%) patients and in the serum of 39 (41%) patients.
32317267,The urine sample from one patient was positive for SARS-CoV-2.
32317267,The median duration of virus in stool (22 days, interquartile range 17-31 days) was significantly longer than in respiratory (18 days, 13-29 days; P=0.02) and serum samples (16 days, 11-21 days; P&lt;0.001).
32317267,The median duration of virus in the respiratory samples of patients with severe disease (21 days, 14-30 days) was significantly longer than in patients with mild disease (14 days, 10-21 days; P=0.04).
32317267,In the mild group, the viral loads peaked in respiratory samples in the second week from disease onset, whereas viral load continued to be high during the third week in the severe group.
32317267,Virus duration was longer in patients older than 60 years and in male patients.
32317267,The duration of SARS-CoV-2 is significantly longer in stool samples than in respiratory and serum samples, highlighting the need to strengthen the management of stool samples in the prevention and control of the epidemic, and the virus persists longer with higher load and peaks later in the respiratory tissue of patients with severe disease.
32317402,The novel SARS-CoV-2 virus has caused a global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32317402,Although immunosuppressed individuals are thought to be at an increased risk of severe disease, little is known about their clinical presentation, disease course, or outcomes.
32317402,We report 15 kidney transplant recipients from the Columbia University kidney transplant program who required hospitalization for confirmed COVID-19, and describe their management, clinical course, and outcomes.
32317402,Patients presented most often with a fever (87%) and/or cough (67%).
32317402,Initial chest x-ray most commonly showed bilateral infiltrates, but 33% had no acute radiographic findings.
32317402,Patients were managed with immunosuppression reduction and the addition of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin.
32317402,Although 27% of our patients needed mechanical ventilation, over half were discharged home by the end of follow-up.
32317402,Kidney transplant recipients with COVID-19 have presentations that are similar to that of the general population.
32317402,Our current treatment protocol appears to be associated with favorable outcomes, but longer follow-up of a larger cohort of patients is needed.
32317408,The newly emerged 2019 novel coronavirus (CoV), named as severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2), like SARS-CoV (now, SARS-CoV-1) and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), has been associated with high infection rates with over 36,405 deaths.
32317408,In the absence of approved marketed drugs against coronaviruses, the treatment and management of this novel CoV disease (COVID-19) worldwide is a challenge.
32317408,Drug repurposing that has emerged as an effective drug discovery approach from earlier approved drugs could reduce the time and cost compared to de novo drug discovery.
32317408,Direct virus-targeted antiviral agents target specific nucleic acid or proteins of the virus while host-based antivirals target either the host innate immune responses or the cellular machineries that are crucial for viral infection.
32317408,Both the approaches necessarily interfere with viral pathogenesis.
32317408,Here we summarize the present status of both virus-based and host-based drug repurposing perspectives for coronaviruses in general and the SARS-CoV-2 in particular.
32317557,As COVID-19 cases surge worldwide, an urgent need exists to enhance our understanding of the role of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in the management of severely ill patients with COVID-19 who develop acute respiratory and cardiac compromise refractory to conventional therapy.
32317557,The purpose of this manuscript is to review our initial clinical experience in 32 patients with confirmed COVID-19 treated with ECMO.A multi-institutional registry and database was created and utilized to assess all patients who were supported with ECMO provided by SpecialtyCare.
32317557,Data captured included patient characteristics, pre-COVID-19 risk factors and comorbidities, confirmation of COVID-19 diagnosis, features of ECMO support, specific medications utilized to treat COVID-19, and short-term outcomes through hospital discharge.
32317557,This analysis includes all of our patients with COVID-19 supported with ECMO, with an analytic window starting March 17, 2020 when our first COVID-19 patient was placed on ECMO, and ending April 9, 2020.
32317557,During the 24 days of this study, 32 consecutive patients with COVID-19 were placed on ECMO at 9 different hospitals.
32317557,As of the time of analysis, 17 remain on ECMO, 10 died prior to or shortly after decannulation, and 5 are alive and extubated after removal from ECMO, with one of these 5 discharged from the hospital.
32317557,Adjunctive medication in the surviving patients while on ECMO was as follows: 4 of 5 survivors received intravenous steroids, 3 of 5 survivors received antiviral medications (Remdesivir), 2 of 5 survivors were treated with anti-interleukin-6-receptor monoclonal antibodies (Tocilizumab or Sarilumab), and 1 of 5 survivors received hydroxychloroquine.An analysis of 32 COVID-19 patients with severe pulmonary compromise supported with ECMO suggests that ECMO may play a useful role in salvaging select critically ill patients with COVID-19.
32317557,Additional patient experience and associated clinical and laboratory data must be obtained to further define the optimal role of ECMO in patients with COVID-19 and ARDS.
32317557,These initial data may provide useful information to help define the best strategies to care for these challenging patients, and may also provide a framework for much-needed future research about the use of ECMO to treat patients with COVID-19.
32317558,We report, to the best of our knowledge, the first case of a probable COVID-19 infection in a 28-year-old man with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.
32317558,The diagnosis was established through a remote interaction with the patient after early discharge from outpatient therapy due to upcoming traveling restrictions.
32317558,The COVID-19 disease appeared mild, without major respiratory problems, and no obvious neuromuscular deterioration was reported or observed.
32317558,Telerehabilitation provided an opportunity to continue with hand rehabilitation after tendon transfer surgery, perform an ad-hoc online evaluation, and advise the patient how to prevent the spread of infection and cope with restrictions limiting outpatient visits.
32317558,This experience seems valuable for further development of telerehabilitation in anticipation of future pandemics or adversarial events since it allows reaching out to patients unable to travel and overcomes the need for regular outpatient visits.
32317808,The clinical knowledge about the course, complications and treatment of COVID-19 in children and adolescents is so far limited.
32317808,This systematic review summarizes the current scientific evidence regarding the clinical presentation of COVID-19 in hospitalized children based on available case series from China.
32317808,In addition, first data from a nationwide pediatric hospital survey conducted by the German Society for Pediatric Infectious Diseases (DGPI) are presented.
32317808,This study evaluated 12 case series from China with 6-2143 children infected with SARS-CoV‑2, which were identified by a literature search in PubMed up to 31 March 2020.
32317808,The database of the German nationwide DGPI COVID-19 survey was accessed on 6 April 2020.
32317808,The median patient age in the case series was between 2 and 7 years and 18-45% were infants &lt;1 year of age.
32317808,The duration of hospital stay was 5-20 days.
32317808,Most commonly reported symptoms were fever and cough; in 40-100% of cases involvement of the lower respiratory tract was reported, usually confirmed by computed tomography (CT).
32317808,Severe and critical courses of disease were reported in up to 8% of the children including 2 fatalities.
32317808,So far the German DGPI COVID-19 survey reported 33 hospitalized children up to 6 April 2020, mostly with upper airway infections.
32317808,Of these children, 45% were infants and 32% had an underlying medical condition.
32317808,So far 3 children (9%) needed admission to an intensive care unit.
32317808,COVID-19 in hospitalized children usually presented as an uncomplicated febrile upper airway infection or mild pneumonia.
32317808,Severe cases or fatalities rarely occurred in children.
32317808,Information on neonates and children with underlying chronic conditions as well as on therapeutic and preventive measures are urgently needed.
32317810,As the SARS-CoV-2 virus race around the world across the different population, there needs to be a consolidated effort to understand the divergence of demographically distributed strains.
32317810,The emerging trends in SARS-CoV-2 genome data show specific mutation and genetic diversity, which could provide the basis to develop a cocktail of vaccine and may also be used to develop the region-specific diagnostic tool, thus decreasing the chances of testing failures in fields.
32317810,Since the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is subject to the extent of human interaction, the insights from the correlation of genetic diversity with epidemiological parameter would give paramount information to tackle this transmission.
32317810,Previously, studies have also correlated the epidemiological data with gut microbiome and its role in immunomodulation for maintaining health status, and such information could be generated from recovered individuals from different demographic regions.
32317810,It will help in designing a probiotic-based diet for modulation of the gut microbiome, and that could be another plausible prophylactic treatment option.
32317810,The genomics data suggest that a specific variant of SARS-CoV-2 gets enriched with the specific demographic region.
32317810,Overall, demographic data suggests that host influences mutation and expression of the virus.
32317810,Hence, the experiences from the clinical intervention for that region should be considered in control and treatment strategies.
32318324,The ongoing outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in China is lifting widespread concerns.
32318324,Thus, therapeutic options are urgently needed, and will be discussed in this review.
32318324,Iron-containing enzymes are required for viruses most likely including coronaviruses (CoVs) to complete their replication process.
32318324,Moreover, poor prognosis occurred in the conditions of iron overload for patients upon infections of viruses.
32318324,Thus, limiting iron represents a promising adjuvant strategy in treating viral infection through oral uptake or venous injection of iron chelators, or through the manipulation of the key iron regulators.
32318324,For example, treatment with iron chelator deferiprone has been shown to prolong the survival of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients.
32318324,Increasing intracellular iron efflux via increasing iron exporter ferroportin expression also exhibits antiviral effect on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
32318324,The implications of other metals besides iron are also briefly discussed.
32318324,For even though we know little about iron regulation in COVID-19 patients thus far, it could be deduced from other viral infections that iron chelation might be an alternative beneficial adjuvant in treating COVID-19.
32318325,The objectives of this study were to analyze the clinical features of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and evaluate the diagnosis and treatment.
32318325,A retrospective analysis of the clinical manifestation and auxiliary examination of 19 patients with COVID-19 from the Liyuan Hospital intensive care unit (ICU) between January 16, 2020 and February 20, 2020 was undertaken.
32318325,There were 11 male and 8 female cases among the patients.
32318325,The median (range) age was 73 (38-91) years.
32318325,Of these patients, 8 (42.1%) had died and the median duration from ICU admission to death was 2 (interquartile range (IQR): 1-10.75) days.
32318325,Seven of these 8 patients had underlying diseases.
32318325,The auxiliary examination showed fever (68.4%), dry cough (15.8%), dyspnea (10.5%), and diarrhea (5.3%).
32318325,All 19 cases showed ground-glass changes on chest computed tomography.
32318325,Serum hypersensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and serum amylase A (SAA) were clearly increased in all of the cases.
32318325,Among the 19 cases, there were 16 (84.2%) cases in which the total number of lymphocytes decreased, 12 cases (63%) had reduced liver function, and 11 cases (58%) had deviant results for fibrinogen (FIB) and D-dimer, in particular, the D-dimer level was significantly higher in the non-survivors compared with the survivors.
32318325,There were more men than women among critically ill patients.
32318325,All of the cases showed ground-glass changes on chest computed tomography and the vast majority of patients displayed fever and dry cough.
32318325,The clinical laboratory indices change significantly, especially the D-dimer level among non-survivors.
32318330,The care of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has been radically altered by COVID-19, especially in New York City, the epicenter of the pandemic.
32318330,Here we summarize how telemedicine, virtual visits, delayed transfusions, and chemotherapy, preferably selecting self-administered medications and visits by home healthcare workers, are employed to minimize exposure of our high-risk population of patients to the virus.
32318330,The unique challenges of transplants during the pandemic and the consequences of an abrupt halt in all non-essential research activities are described.
32318330,Not all the changes forced by COVID-19 are detrimental.
32318665,Since December 2019, an outbreak of the Corona Virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China, has become a public health emergency of international concern.
32318665,The high fatality of aged cases caused by SARS-CoV-2 was a need to explore the possible age-related phenomena with non-human primate models.
32318665,Three 3-5 years old and two 15 years old rhesus macaques were intratracheally infected with SARS-CoV-2, and then analyzed by clinical signs, viral replication, chest X-ray, histopathological changes and immune response.
32318665,Viral replication of nasopharyngeal swabs, anal swabs and lung in old monkeys was more active than that in young monkeys for 14 days after SARS-CoV-2 challenge.
32318665,Monkeys developed typical interstitial pneumonia characterized by thickened alveolar septum accompanied with inflammation and edema, notably, old monkeys exhibited diffuse severe interstitial pneumonia.
32318665,Viral antigens were detected mainly in alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages.
32318665,SARS-CoV-2 caused more severe interstitial pneumonia in old monkeys than that in young monkeys.
32318665,Rhesus macaque models infected with SARS-CoV-2 provided insight into the pathogenic mechanism and facilitated the development of vaccines and therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32318706,Although Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is mild in nearly all children, a small proportion of pediatric patients develops severe or critical illness.
32318706,Guidance is therefore needed regarding use of agents with potential activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in pediatrics.
32318706,A panel of pediatric infectious diseases physicians and pharmacists from 18 geographically diverse North American institutions was convened.
32318706,Through a series of teleconferences and web-based surveys, a set of guidance statements was developed and refined based on review of best available evidence and expert opinion.
32318706,Given the typically mild course of pediatric COVID-19, supportive care alone is suggested for the overwhelming majority of cases.
32318706,The panel suggests a decision-making framework for antiviral therapy that weighs risks and benefits based on disease severity as indicated by respiratory support needs, with consideration on a case-by-case basis of potential pediatric risk factors for disease progression.
32318706,If an antiviral is used, the panel suggests remdesivir as the preferred agent.
32318706,Hydroxychloroquine could be considered for patients who are not candidates for remdesivir or when remdesivir is not available.
32318706,Antivirals should preferably be used as part of a clinical trial if available.
32318706,Antiviral therapy for COVID-19 is not necessary for the great majority of pediatric patients.
32318706,For those rare children who develop severe or critical disease, this guidance offer an approach for decision-making regarding antivirals, informed by available data.
32318706,As evidence continues to evolve rapidly, the need for updates to the guidance is anticipated.
32318865,Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is a cause of significant morbidity and mortality worldwide.
32318865,While cardiac injury has been demonstrated in critically ill COVID-19 patients, the mechanism of injury remains unclear.
32318865,Here, we review our current knowledge of the biology of SARS-CoV-2 and the potential mechanisms of myocardial injury due to viral toxicities and host immune responses.
32318865,A number of studies have reported an epidemiological association between history of cardiac disease and worsened outcome during COVID infection.
32318865,Development of new onset myocardial injury during COVID-19 also increases mortality.
32318865,While limited data exist, potential mechanisms of cardiac injury include direct viral entry through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and toxicity in host cells, hypoxia-related myocyte injury, and immune-mediated cytokine release syndrome.
32318865,Potential treatments for reducing viral infection and excessive immune responses are also discussed.
32318865,COVID patients with cardiac disease history or acquire new cardiac injury are at an increased risk for in-hospital morbidity and mortality.
32318865,More studies are needed to address the mechanism of cardiotoxicity and the treatments that can minimize permanent damage to the cardiovascular system.
32318986,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been recognized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization.
32318986,Global efforts have been exerted to prevent the spreading of the disease through political decisions together with personal behaviors, which depend on awareness of the public.
32318986,The goal of this study is to assess the knowledge, perceptions and attitude of the Egyptian public towards the COVID-19 disease.
32318986,We conducted a cross-sectional survey about these points, which was distributed among adult Egyptians.
32318986,Five hundred and fifty nine persons completed the survey.
32318986,The mean knowledge score was 16.39 out of 23, gained mainly though social media (66.9%), and the internet (58.3%).
32318986,Knowledge was significantly lower among older, less educated, lower income participants, and rural residents.
32318986,Most participants (86.9%) were concerned about the risk of infection.
32318986,While 37.6% thought that their salary will be continued if they become isolated, 68.5% believed that it should be continued during this period.
32318986,About 73.0% were looking forward to get the vaccine when available.
32318986,In general, participants had a good knowledge about the disease and a positive attitude towards protective measures.
32318986,This knowledge is gained mainly through novel media channels, which have pros and cons.
32318986,Although the government has taken major steps to educate the public and limit the spread of the disease, more effort is needed to educate and support the lower economic strata.
32318986,If a vaccine or a treatment is approved, we recommend a government control over its use to preserve the rights of the vulnerable and needy groups.
32319129,While the world is facing an unprecedented pandemic with COVID-19, patients with chronic diseases need special attention and if warranted adaptation of their regular treatment plan.
32319129,In children, allergy and asthma are among the most prevalent non-communicable chronic diseases, and health care providers taking care of these patients need guidance.
32319129,At the current stage of knowledge, children have less severe symptoms of COVID-19, and severe asthma and immunodeficiency are classified as risk factors.
32319129,In addition, there is no evidence that currently available asthma and allergy treatments, including antihistamines, corticosteroids, bronchodilators increase the risk of severe disease from COVID-19.
32319129,Most countries affected by COVID-19 have opted for nationwide confinement, which means that communication with the primary clinician is often performed by telemedicine.
32319129,Optimal disease control of allergic, asthmatic and immunodeficient children should be sought according to usual treatment guidelines.
32319129,This statement of the EAACI Section on Pediatrics puts forward six recommendations for the management of childhood allergies and immunodeficiencies based on six underlying facts and existing evidence.
32319218,The SARS-CoV-2-infection can be seen as a single disease but also affects patients with relevant comorbidities who may have an increased risk of a severe course of infection.
32319218,In this report, we present a 77-year old patient with a heart transplant under relevant immunosuppressive therapy who was tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 after several days of dyspnoea, dry cough and light general symptoms.
32319218,The CT-scan confirmed an interstitial pneumonia.
32319218,The patient received an antiviral therapy with hydroxychloroquine showing no further deterioration of the clinical state.
32319218,After 12 days of hospitalisation the patient was released SARS-CoV-2 negative and completely asymptomatic.
32319424,The ongoing novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is threatening the global human population, including in countries with resource-limited health facilities.
32319424,Severe bilateral pneumonia is the main feature of severe COVID-19, and adequate ventilatory support is crucial for patient survival.
32319424,Although our knowledge of the disease is still rapidly increasing, this review summarizes current guidance on the best provision of ventilatory support, with a focus on resource-limited settings.
32319424,Key messages include that supplemental oxygen is a first essential step for the treatment of severe COVID-19 patients with hypoxemia and should be a primary focus in resource-limited settings where capacity for invasive ventilation is limited.
32319424,Oxygen delivery can be increased by using a non-rebreathing mask and prone positioning.
32319424,The presence of only hypoxemia should in general not trigger intubation because hypoxemia is often remarkably well tolerated.
32319424,Patients with fatigue and at risk for exhaustion, because of respiratory distress, will require invasive ventilation.
32319424,In these patients, lung protective ventilation is essential.
32319424,Severe pneumonia in COVID-19 differs in some important aspects from other causes of severe pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome, and limiting the positive end-expiratory pressure level on the ventilator may be important.
32319424,This ventilation strategy might reduce the currently very high case fatality rate of more than 50% in invasively ventilated COVID-19 patients.
32319435,A position statement published by the Italian Society of Anesthesia Analgesia Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) is fostering a vibrant debate, crossed by deep fears.
32319435,These are recommendations addressed to ICU doctors who must decide whether to implement intensive treatments for patients who need them to survive.
32319435,Specifically, the reference is to the patients to whom the CoViD-19 epidemic has compromised respiratory capacity.
32319435,We still do not have clear what positive criteria can help make clinical decisions in contexts of insufficient resources that force us to make choices.
32319436,In these times of insufficient resources for all there can be no shared decision-making, that is, a shared plan of care.
32319436,Without attempting to subtly induce the patient to believe that it is the best decision for him.
32319436,In the case of CoViD-19, we must rely on professionals: it is not the time for the anticipated treatment plan, for self-determination.
32319436,Of course, we can always say &quot;no&quot;; but we hope that as soon as possible we will be able to take back all the freedoms that has just been conquered: that of end-of-life choices, after a process of sharing with the carers.
32319436,But in this difficult moment someone can also feel a relief - that of the old paternalistic choices - that someone else decides for us.
32319443,On 6 March 2020, the Italian Society of Anaesthesia Analgesia Resuscitation and Intensive care (SIAARTI) published the document &quot;Clinical Ethics Recommendations for Admission to and Suspension of Intensive Care in Exceptional Conditions of Imbalance between Needs and Available Resources&quot;.
32319443,The document, which aims to propose treatment decision-making criteria in the face of exceptional imbalances between health needs and available resources, has produced strong reactions, within the medical-scientific community, in the academic world, and in the media.
32319443,In the current context of international public health emergency caused by the CoViD-19 epidemic, this work aims to explain the ethical, deontological and legal bases of the SIAARTI Document and to propose methodologic and argumentative integrations that are useful for understanding and placing in context the decision-making criteria proposed.
32319443,The working group that contributed to the drafting of this paper agrees that it is appropriate that healthcare personnel, who is particularly committed to taking care of those who are currently in need of intensive or sub-intensive care, should benefit from clear operational indications that are useful to orient care and, at the same time, that the population should know in advance which criteria will guide the tragic choices that may fall on each one of us.
32319443,This contribution therefore firstly reflects on the appropriateness of the SIAARTI standpoint and the objectives of the SIAARTI Document.
32319443,It then turns to demonstrate how the recommendations it proposes can be framed within a shared interdisciplinary, ethical, deontological and legal perspective.
32319444,The pandemic infection caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2 has determined a severe imbalance between demand and actual supply of intensive care.
32319444,The shortage of intensive care units (ICU) beds and ventilators for the treatment of patients with severe respiratory failure produced angst in the clinicians/intensivists who have to decide which patients admit to ICU and in which patients to implement palliative care.
32319444,They have to apply specific clinical and ethical criteria, in emergency conditions.
32319444,Proportionality and appropriateness criteria should be integrated with equity, equality, utility criteria, widening the distributive justice concept from the right of the patient to receive all available therapies to a right resources allocation during shortage, guided by public health ethic.
32319444,The clinical criteria should include the disease severity, the number and severity of comorbidities, frailty, the organ failures and their stage, the patient's age, the functional autonomy and cognitive status.
32319444,Consequently the first come-first served rule to ICU admission should not be applied.
32319444,The patients not admitted to ICU due to clinical reasons and advanced stage diseases should receive a high quality palliative care, to obtain a good symptoms control (mainly dyspnea, anxiety and delirium) and to implement palliative sedation at the end of life.
32319444,Finally particular attention should be paid to the bereavement management of the family/caregivers and in the right approach of psychological problems and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder of health workers involved in the pandemia.
32319447,Given the succession of communications in scientific and popular circuits, tending to take for granted a role for vitamin D in the control of the coronavirus pandemic, the authors conducted an analysis of the literature currently available in order to recognize what is supported by opinions personal and what evidence of effectiveness.
32319447,At the end of the bibliographic survey there is the current absence of evidence of efficacy in favor of vitamin D in the treatment of coronavirus infection in its various expressions.
32319447,The diffusion of personal opinions as if they were evidence can be a disturbing factor for adequate assistance and for correct research.
32319971,According to WHO recommendations, everyone must protect themselves against Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which will also protect others.
32319971,Due to the lack of current effective treatment and vaccine for COVID-19, screening, rapid diagnosis and isolation of the patients are essential (1, 2).
32319971,Therefore, identifying the early symptoms of COVID-19 is of particular importance and is a health system priority.
32319971,Early studies from COVID-19 outbreak in China have illustrated several non-specific signs and symptoms in infected patients, including fever, dry cough, dyspnea, myalgia, fatigue, lymphopenia, and radiographic evidence of pneumonia (3, 4).
32319971,Recently, a probability of association between COVID-19 and altered olfactory function has been reported in South Korea, Iran, Italy, France, UK and the United States (5-8).
32319971,However, to our knowledge, the definite association between COVID-19 and anosmia has not been published.
32320003,There is limited information describing the presenting characteristics and outcomes of US patients requiring hospitalization for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32320003,To describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in a US health care system.
32320003,Case series of patients with COVID-19 admitted to 12 hospitals in New York City, Long Island, and Westchester County, New York, within the Northwell Health system.
32320003,The study included all sequentially hospitalized patients between March 1, 2020, and April 4, 2020, inclusive of these dates.
32320003,Confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection by positive result on polymerase chain reaction testing of a nasopharyngeal sample among patients requiring admission.
32320003,Clinical outcomes during hospitalization, such as invasive mechanical ventilation, kidney replacement therapy, and death.
32320003,Demographics, baseline comorbidities, presenting vital signs, and test results were also collected.
32320003,A total of 5700 patients were included (median age, 63 years [interquartile range {IQR}, 52-75; range, 0-107 years]; 39.7% female).
32320003,The most common comorbidities were hypertension (3026; 56.6%), obesity (1737; 41.7%), and diabetes (1808; 33.8%).
32320003,At triage, 30.7% of patients were febrile, 17.3% had a respiratory rate greater than 24 breaths/minute, and 27.8% received supplemental oxygen.
32320003,The rate of respiratory virus co-infection was 2.1%.
32320003,Outcomes were assessed for 2634 patients who were discharged or had died at the study end point.
32320003,During hospitalization, 373 patients (14.2%) (median age, 68 years [IQR, 56-78]; 33.5% female) were treated in the intensive care unit care, 320 (12.2%) received invasive mechanical ventilation, 81 (3.2%) were treated with kidney replacement therapy, and 553 (21%) died.
32320003,Mortality for those requiring mechanical ventilation was 88.1%.
32320003,The median postdischarge follow-up time was 4.4 days (IQR, 2.2-9.3).
32320003,A total of 45 patients (2.2%) were readmitted during the study period.
32320003,The median time to readmission was 3 days (IQR, 1.0-4.5) for readmitted patients.
32320003,Among the 3066 patients who remained hospitalized at the final study follow-up date (median age, 65 years [IQR, 54-75]), the median follow-up at time of censoring was 4.5 days (IQR, 2.4-8.1).
32320003,This case series provides characteristics and early outcomes of sequentially hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 in the New York City area.
32320066,An outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection has recently emerged and rapidly spreading in humans causing a significant threat to international health and the economy.
32320066,Rapid assessment and warning are crucial for an outbreak analysis in response to serious public health.
32320066,SARS-CoV-2 shares highly homological sequences with SARS-CoVs causing highly lethal pneumonia with respiratory distress and clinical symptoms similar to those reported for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections.
32320066,Notably, some COVID-19 patients also expressed neurologic signs like nausea, headache, and vomiting.
32320066,Several studies have reported that coronaviruses are not only causing respiratory illness but also invade the central nervous system through a synapse-connected route.
32320066,SARS-CoV infections are reported in both patients and experimental animals' brains.
32320066,Interestingly, some COVID-19 patients have shown the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in their cerebrospinal fluid.
32320066,Considering the similarities between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in various aspects, it remains to clarify whether the potent invasion of SARS-CoV-2 may affect in COVID-19 patients.
32320066,All these indicate that more detailed criteria are needed for the treatment and the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.
32320066,In the absence of potential interventions for COVID-19, there is an urgent need for an alternative strategy to control the spread of this disease.
32320359,<b>Objective:</b> To investigate the prevalence, characteristics, and preventive status of skin injuries caused by personal protective equipment (PPE) in medical staff. <b>Approach:</b> A cross-sectional survey was conducted online for understanding skin injuries among medical staff fighting COVID-19 in February 8-22, 2020.
32320359,Participants voluntarily answered and submitted the questionnaire with cell phone.
32320359,The questionnaire items included demographic data, grade of PPE and daily wearing time, skin injury types, anatomical sites, and preventive measures.
32320359,Univariable analyses and logistic regression analyses were used to explore the risk factors associated with skin injuries. <b>Results:</b> A total of 4,308 respondents were collected from 161 hospitals and 4,306 respondents were valid.
32320359,The overall prevalence of skin injuries was 42.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 41.30-44.30) with three types of device-related pressure injuries, moist-associated skin damage, and skin tear.
32320359,Co-skin injuries and multiple location injuries were 27.4% and 76.8%, respectively.
32320359,The logistic regression analysis indicated that sweating (95% CI for odds ratio [OR] 87.52-163.11), daily wearing time (95% CI for OR 1.61-3.21), male (95% CI for OR 1.11-2.13), and grade 3 PPE (95% CI for OR 1.08-2.01) were associated with skin injuries.
32320359,Only 17.7% of respondents took prevention and 45.0% of skin injuries were treated. <b>Innovation:</b> This is the first cross-sectional survey to understand skin injuries in medical staff caused by PPE, which is expected to be a benchmark. <b>Conclusion:</b> The skin injuries among medical staff are serious, with insufficient prevention and treatment.
32320359,A comprehensive program should be taken in the future.
32320375,Much has happened here since the local news media trumpeted the first Australian COVID-19 fatality, and stirred up a medieval fear of contagion.
32320375,We now need to take a step back to examine the logic underlying the use of our limited COVID-19 countermeasures.
32320375,Emerging infectious diseases by their nature, pose new challenges to the diagnostic-treatment-control nexus, and push our concepts of causality beyond the limits of the conventional Koch-Henle approach to aetiology.
32320375,We need to use contemporary methods of assessing causality to ensure that clinical, laboratory and public health measures draw on a rational, evidence-based approach to argumentation.
32320375,The purpose of any aetiological hypothesis is to derive actionable insights into this latest emerging infectious disease.
32320375,This review is an introduction to a conversation with medical microbiologists, which will be supported by a moderated blog.
32320381,During the first week of March, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak reached more than 100 countries with over 100,000 cases.
32320381,Health care authorities have already initiated awareness and preparedness activities worldwide.
32320381,A poor understanding of the disease among health care workers (HCWs) may result in delayed treatment and result in the rapid spread of the infection.
32320381,This study aimed to investigate the knowledge and perceptions of HCWs about COVID-19.
32320381,A cross-sectional, web-based study was conducted among HCWs about COVID-19 during the first week of March 2020.
32320381,A 23-item survey instrument was developed and distributed randomly to HCWs using social media; it required 5 minutes to complete.
32320381,A chi-square test was used to investigate the level of association among variables, with significance set to P&lt;.05.
32320381,Of 529 participants, a total of 453 HCWs completed the survey (response rate: 85.6%); 51.6% (n=234) were male, 32.1% (n=147) were aged 25-34 years, and most were doctors (n=137, 30.2%) and medical students (n=134, 29.6%).
32320381,Most participants (n=276, 61.0%) used social media to obtain information on COVID-19.
32320381,A significant proportion of HCWs had poor knowledge of its transmission (n=276, 61.0%) and symptom onset (n=288, 63.6%) and showed positive perceptions of COVID-19.
32320381,Factors such as age and profession were associated with inadequate knowledge and a poor perception of COVID-19.
32320381,As the global threat of COVID-19 continues to emerge, it is critical to improve the knowledge and perceptions of HCWs.
32320381,Educational interventions are urgently needed to reach HCWs worldwide, and further studies are warranted.
32320384,Anti-SARS-CoV-2 virus antibody levels in convalescent plasma (CP), which may be useful in severe Anti-SARS-CoV-2 virus infections, have been rarely reported.
32320384,A total of eight donors were considered for enrollment; two of them were excluded because of ineligible routine check.
32320384,Of the six remaining participants, five samples were tested weakly positive by the IgM ELISA.
32320384,Meanwhile, high titers of IgG were observed in five samples.
32320384,The patient treated with CP did not require mechanical ventilation 11 days after plasma transfusion, and was then transferred to a general ward.
32320384,Our serological findings in convalescent plasma from recovered patients may help facilitate understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 infection and establish CP donor screening protocol in COVID-19 outbreak.
32320384,Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies including IgM and IgG were measured by two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) in convalescent plasma from six donors who have recovered from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Nanjing, China.
32320384,CP was also utilized for the treatment of one severe COVID-19 patient.
32320477,As chloroquine (CHQ) is part of the Dutch Centre for Infectious Disease Control coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) experimental treatment guideline, pediatric dosing guidelines are needed.
32320477,Recent pediatric data suggest that existing World Health Organization (WHO) dosing guidelines for children with malaria are suboptimal.
32320477,The aim of our study was to establish best-evidence to inform pediatric CHQ doses for children infected with COVID-19.
32320477,A previously developed physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model for CHQ was used to simulate exposure in adults and children and verified against published pharmacokinetic data.
32320477,The COVID-19 recommended adult dosage regimen of 44 mg/kg total was tested in adults and children to evaluate the extent of variation in exposure.
32320477,Based on differences in area under the concentration-time curve from zero to 70 hours (AUC<sub>0-70h</sub> ) the optimal CHQ dose was determined in children of different ages compared with adults.
32320477,Revised doses were re-introduced into the model to verify that overall CHQ exposure in each age band was within 5% of the predicted adult value.
32320477,Simulations showed differences in drug exposure in children of different ages and adults when the same body-weight based dose is given.
32320477,As such, we propose the following total cumulative doses: 35 mg/kg (CHQ base) for children 0-1 month, 47 mg/kg for 1-6 months, 55 mg/kg for 6 months-12 years, and 44 mg/kg for adolescents and adults, not to exceed 3,300 mg in any patient.
32320477,Our study supports age-adjusted CHQ dosing in children with COVID-19 in order to avoid suboptimal or toxic doses.
32320477,The knowledge-driven, model-informed dose selection paradigm can serve as a science-based alternative to recommend pediatric dosing when pediatric clinical trial data is absent.
32320478,Concerns have been raised regarding the safety of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in patients with coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), based on the hypothesis that such medications may raise expression of ACE2, the receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32320478,We conducted a literature review of studies (n = 12) in experimental animals and human subjects (n = 12) and evaluated the evidence regarding the impact of administration of ACEIs and ARBs on ACE2 expression.
32320478,We prioritized studies that assessed ACE2 protein expression data, measured directly or inferred from ACE2 activity assays.
32320478,The findings in animals are inconsistent with respect to an increase in ACE2 expression in response to treatment with ACEIs or ARBs.
32320478,Control/sham animals show little to no effect in the plurality of studies.
32320478,Those studies that report increases in ACE2 expression tend to involve acute injury models and/or higher doses of ACEIs or ARBs than are typically administered to patients.
32320478,Data from human studies overwhelmingly imply that administration of ACEIs/ARBs does not increase ACE2 expression.
32320478,Available evidence, in particular, data from human studies, does not support the hypothesis that ACEI/ARB use increases ACE2 expression and the risk of complications from COVID-19.
32320478,We conclude that patients being treated with ACEIs and ARBs should continue their use for approved indications.
32320494,The COVID-19 pandemic has raised questions about the approach to management of systemic immunosuppressive therapies for dermatologic indications in children.
32320494,Change to: Given the absence of data to address concerns related to SARS-CoV-2 infection and systemic immunosuppressive therapies in an evidence-based manner, a Pediatric Dermatology COVID-19 Response Task Force (PDCRTF) was assembled to offer time-sensitive guidance for clinicians.
32320494,A survey was distributed to an expert panel of 37 pediatric dermatologists on the PDCRTF to assess expert opinion and current practice related to three primary domains of systemic therapy: initiation, continuation, and laboratory monitoring.
32320494,Nearly all respondents (97%) reported that the COVID-19 pandemic had impacted their decision to initiate immunosuppressive medications.
32320494,The majority of pediatric dermatologists (87%) reported that they were pausing or reducing the frequency of laboratory monitoring for certain immunosuppressive medications.
32320494,In asymptomatic patients, continuing therapy was the most popular choice across all medications queried.
32320494,The majority agreed that patients on immunosuppressive medications who have a household exposure to COVID-19 or test positive for new infection should temporarily discontinue systemic and biologic medications, with the exception of systemic steroids, which may require tapering.
32320494,The ultimate decision regarding initiation, continuation, and laboratory monitoring of immunosuppressive therapy during the pandemic requires careful deliberation, consideration of the little evidence available, and discussion with families.
32320494,Consideration of an individual's adherence to COVID-19 preventive measures, risk of exposure, and the potential severity if infected must be weighed against the dermatological disease, medication, and risks to the patient of tapering or discontinuing therapies.
32320506,Prolonged and unaddressed hypoxia can lead to poor patient outcomes.
32320506,Proning has become a standard treatment in the management of patients with ARDS who have difficulty achieving adequate oxygen saturation.
32320506,The purpose of this study was to describe the use of early proning of awake, non-intubated patients in the emergency department (ED) during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32320506,This pilot study was carried out in a single urban ED in New York City.
32320506,We included patients suspected of having COVID-19 with hypoxia on arrival.
32320506,A standard pulse oximeter was used to measure SpO<sub>2</sub> .
32320506,SpO<sub>2</sub> measurements were recorded at triage and after 5 minutes of proning.
32320506,Supplemental oxygenation methods included non-rebreather mask (NRB) and nasal cannula.
32320506,We also characterized post-proning failure rates of intubation within the first 24 hours of arrival to the ED.
32320506,Fifty patients were included.
32320506,Overall, the median SpO<sub>2</sub> at triage was 80% (IQR 69 to 85).
32320506,After application of supplemental oxygen was given to patients on room air it was 84% (IQR 75 to 90).
32320506,After 5 minutes of proning was added SpO<sub>2</sub> improved to 94% (IQR 90 to 95).
32320506,Comparison of the pre- to post-median by the Wilcoxon Rank-sum test yielded P = 0.001.
32320506,Thirteen patients (24%) failed to improve or maintain their oxygen saturations and required endotracheal intubation within 24 hours of arrival to the ED.
32320506,Awake early self-proning in the emergency department demonstrated improved oxygen saturation in our COVID-19 positive patients.
32320506,Further studies are needed to support causality and determine the effect of proning on disease severity and mortality.
32320516,A cluster of pneumonia (COVID-19) cases have been found in Wuhan China in late December, 2019, and subsequently, a novel coronavirus with a positive stranded RNA was identified to be the aetiological virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2), which has a phylogenetic similarity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV).
32320516,SARS-CoV-2 transmits mainly through droplets and close contact and the elder or people with chronic diseases are high-risk population.
32320516,People affected by SARS-CoV-2 can be asymptomatic, which brings about more difficulties to control the transmission.
32320516,COVID-19 has become pandemic rapidly after onset, and so far the infected people have been above 2 000 000 and more than 130 000 died worldwide according to COVID-19 situation dashboard of World Health Organization (https://covid19.who.int).
32320516,Here, we summarized the current known knowledge regarding epidemiological, pathogenesis, pathology, clinical features, comorbidities and treatment of COVID-19/ SARS-CoV-2 as reference for the prevention and control COVID-19.
32320517,Coagulopathy is a common abnormality in patients with COVID-19.
32320517,However, the exact incidence of venous thromboembolic event is unknown in anticoagulated, severe COVID-19 patients.
32320517,Systematic assessment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) using complete duplex ultrasound (CDU) in anticoagulated COVID-19 patients.
32320517,We performed a retrospective study in 2 French intensive care units (ICU) where CDU is performed as a standard of care.
32320517,A CDU from thigh to ankle at selected sites with Doppler waveforms and images was performed early during ICU stay in patients admitted with COVID-19.
32320517,Anticoagulation dose was left to the discretion of the treating physician based on the individual risk of thrombosis.
32320517,Patients were classified as treated with prophylactic anticoagulation or therapeutic anticoagulation.
32320517,Pulmonary embolism was systematically searched in patients with persistent hypoxemia or secondary deterioration.
32320517,From March 19 to April 11, 2020, 26 consecutive patients with severe COVID-19 were screened for VTE.
32320517,Eight patients (31%) were treated with prophylactic anticoagulation, whereas 18 patients (69%) were treated with therapeutic anticoagulation.
32320517,The overall rate of VTE in patients was 69%.
32320517,The proportion of VTE was significantly higher in patients treated with prophylactic anticoagulation when compared with the other group (100% vs 56%, respectively, P = .03).
32320517,Surprisingly, we found a high rate of thromboembolic events in COVID-19 patients treated with therapeutic anticoagulation, with 56% of VTE and 6 pulmonary embolisms.
32320517,Our results suggest considering both systematic screening of VTE and early therapeutic anticoagulation in severe ICU COVID-19 patients.
32320677,Proper management of COVID-19 mandates better understanding of disease pathogenesis.
32320677,The sudden clinical deterioration 7-8 days after initial symptom onset suggests that severe respiratory failure (SRF) in COVID-19 is driven by a unique pattern of immune dysfunction.
32320677,We studied immune responses of 54 COVID-19 patients, 28 of whom had SRF.
32320677,All patients with SRF displayed either macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) or very low human leukocyte antigen D related (HLA-DR) expression accompanied by profound depletion of CD4 lymphocytes, CD19 lymphocytes, and natural killer (NK) cells.
32320677,Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) production by circulating monocytes was sustained, a pattern distinct from bacterial sepsis or influenza.
32320677,SARS-CoV-2 patient plasma inhibited HLA-DR expression, and this was partially restored by the IL-6 blocker Tocilizumab; off-label Tocilizumab treatment of patients was accompanied by increase in circulating lymphocytes.
32320677,Thus, the unique pattern of immune dysregulation in severe COVID-19 is characterized by IL-6-mediated low HLA-DR expression and lymphopenia, associated with sustained cytokine production and hyper-inflammation.
32320825,Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses known to cause illnesses that vary between the common cold and more severe diseases to include severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).
32320825,A novel coronavirus was identified in December 2019 in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.
32320825,This virus represents a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans.
32320825,The virus is now known as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the resulting disease is called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32320825,The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a global pandemic in March 2020.
32320825,Despite rigorous global containment and quarantine efforts, the incidence of COVID-19 continues to rise, with more than 1,948,617 laboratory-confirmed cases and over 121,846 deaths worldwide.
32320825,Currently, no specific medication is recommended to treat COVID-19 patients.
32320825,However, governments and pharmaceutical companies are struggling to quickly find an effective drug to defeat the coronavirus.
32320825,In the current review, we summarize the existing state of knowledge about COVID-19, available medications, and treatment options.
32320825,Favilavir is an antiviral drug that is approved in Japan for common influenza treatment and is now approved to treat symptoms of COVID-19 in China.
32320825,Moreover, Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, drugs used to treat malaria and arthritis, respectively, were recommended by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China for treatment of COVID-19.
32320825,Presently, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are under investigation by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a treatment for COVID-19.
32320825,The first COVID-19 vaccine is not expected to be ready for clinical trials before the end of the year.
32320852,In the past decade we have seen two major Ebola virus outbreaks in Africa, the Zika virus in Brazil and the Americas and the current pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32320852,There is a strong sense of déjà vu because there are still no effective treatments.
32320852,In the COVID-19 pandemic, despite being a new virus, there are already drugs suggested as active in in vitro assays that are being repurposed in clinical trials.
32320852,Promising SARS-CoV-2 viral targets and computational approaches are described and discussed.
32320852,Here, we propose, based on open antiviral drug discovery approaches for previous outbreaks, that there could still be gaps in our approach to drug discovery.
32321116,This review aims to verify the main epidemiologic, clinical, laboratory-related, and therapeutic aspects of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in critically ill pediatric patients.
32321116,An extensive review of the medical literature on COVID-19 was performed, mainly focusing on the critical care of pediatric patients, considering expert opinions and recent reports related to this new disease.
32321116,Experts from a large Brazilian public university analyzed all recently published material to produce a report aiming to standardize the care of critically ill children and adolescents.
32321116,The report emphasizes on the clinical presentations of the disease and ventilatory support in pediatric patients with COVID-19.
32321116,It establishes a flowchart to guide health practitioners on triaging critical cases.
32321116,COVID-19 is essentially an unknown clinical condition for the majority of pediatric intensive care professionals.
32321116,Guidelines developed by experts can help all practitioners standardize their attitudes and improve the treatment of COVID-19.
32321388,This Open Forum focuses on specific challenges, contingency planning considerations, and downstream impacts of COVID-19 on inpatient psychiatric care.
32321388,COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus that has been declared a pandemic.
32321388,Challenges for inpatient psychiatry include risky close contact among staff and patients, space constraints, and structural barriers in care delivery.
32321388,Nuanced considerations of five contingency planning strategies in response to COVID-19 are described, including COVID-19-specific precautions, visitor restrictions, physician workforce considerations, operational adjustments, and group therapy changes.
32321388,Organized leadership and clear communication are identified as early priorities in pandemic response to minimize misinformation and address immediate challenges.
32321407,2019-nCoVis a novel coronavirus was isolated and identified in 2019 in Wuhan, China.
32321407,On 17 February and according to the world health organization, a number of 71 429 confirmed cases worldwide, among them 2162 new cases recorded in the last 24 hours.
32321407,One month later the confirmed cases jumped to 179111, with 11525new cases in the last 24 hours, with 7426total deaths.
32321407,There is no drug or vaccine for humanand animal coronavirus.The inhibition of 3CL hydrolase enzyme provides a promising therapeutic principle for developing treatments against CoViD-19.
32321407,The 3CLpro (Mpro) known for involving in counteracting the host innate immune response.Thiswork presents the inhibitory effect of some natural compounds against 3CL hydrolase enzyme, and explain the main interactions in inhibitor-enzyme complex.
32321407,Molecular docking study carried out using Autodock Vina.
32321407,By screening several molecules, we identified three candidate agents that inhibit the main protease of coronavirus.
32321407,Hispidin, lepidine E,and folic acid bound tightly in the enzyme, strong hydrogen bonds have been formed (1.69-1.80Å) with the active site residues.This study provides a possible therapeutic strategy for CoViD-19.
32321524,SARS-CoV-2 is a RNA coronavirus responsible for the pandemic of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (COVID-19).
32321524,RNA viruses are characterized by a high mutation rate, up to a million times higher than that of their hosts.
32321524,Virus mutagenic capability depends upon several factors, including the fidelity of viral enzymes that replicate nucleic acids, as SARS-CoV-2 RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp).
32321524,Mutation rate drives viral evolution and genome variability, thereby enabling viruses to escape host immunity and to develop drug resistance.
32321524,We analyzed 220 genomic sequences from the GISAID database derived from patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 worldwide from December 2019 to mid-March 2020.
32321524,SARS-CoV-2 reference genome was obtained from the GenBank database.
32321524,Genomes alignment was performed using Clustal Omega.
32321524,Mann-Whitney and Fisher-Exact tests were used to assess statistical significance.
32321524,We characterized 8 novel recurrent mutations of SARS-CoV-2, located at positions 1397, 2891, 14408, 17746, 17857, 18060, 23403 and 28881.
32321524,Mutations in 2891, 3036, 14408, 23403 and 28881 positions are predominantly observed in Europe, whereas those located at positions 17746, 17857 and 18060 are exclusively present in North America.
32321524,We noticed for the first time a silent mutation in RdRp gene in England (UK) on February 9th, 2020 while a different mutation in RdRp changing its amino acid composition emerged on February 20th, 2020 in Italy (Lombardy).
32321524,Viruses with RdRp mutation have a median of 3 point mutations [range: 2-5], otherwise they have a median of 1 mutation [range: 0-3] (p value &lt; 0.001).
32321524,These findings suggest that the virus is evolving and European, North American and Asian strains might coexist, each of them characterized by a different mutation pattern.
32321524,The contribution of the mutated RdRp to this phenomenon needs to be investigated.
32321524,To date, several drugs targeting RdRp enzymes are being employed for SARS-CoV-2 infection treatment.
32321524,Some of them have a predicted binding moiety in a SARS-CoV-2 RdRp hydrophobic cleft, which is adjacent to the 14408 mutation we identified.
32321524,Consequently, it is important to study and characterize SARS-CoV-2 RdRp mutation in order to assess possible drug-resistance viral phenotypes.
32321524,It is also important to recognize whether the presence of some mutations might correlate with different SARS-CoV-2 mortality rates.
32321530,The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak started in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32321530,The CT image is used to assess the disease progress, whereas the continued two times of negative results from SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection had been considered as a criterion for ending antiviral treatment.
32321530,We compared the two COVID-19 cases with similar backgrounds and CT image repeated intervals under treatment.
32321530,Our report highlighted the unsynchronized expression in the changes of CT image and nucleic acid detection in COVID-19, and lasting positive nucleic acid test result in patients recovered from pneumonia.
32321530,It may be contributed to recognize the disease and improve prevention.
32321540,On March 11th, 2020 the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic.
32321540,The infection, transmitted by 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCov), was first discovered in December 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei Province, and then rapidly spread worldwide.
32321540,Italy was early and severely involved, with a critical spread of the infection and a very high number of victims.
32321540,Person-to-person spread mainly occurs via respiratory droplets and contact.
32321540,The median incubation period is 5 days.
32321540,The spectrum of respiratory symptoms may range from mild to severe, strictly depending on the age of the patient and the underlying comorbidities.In children COVID-19 related disease is less frequent and less aggressive.
32321540,In Italy 1% of positive cases are under 18 years of age, and no deaths have been recorded before 29 years of age.
32321540,For patients affected by rheumatic disease, despite the concerns related to the imbalance of their immune response and the effect of immunosuppressive treatments, there are still few data to understand the real consequences of this infection.
32321540,Major scientific societies have issued recommendations to help rheumatologists in caring their patients.
32321540,Interestingly, some of the drugs mostly used by rheumatologists appear to be promising in critical COVID-19 infected patients, where the hyperinflammation and cytokine storm seem to drive to the multiorgan failure.Pediatric rheumatologists are expected to play a supporting role in this new front of COVID-19 pandemic, both as general pediatricians treating infected children, and as rheumatologists taking care of their rheumatic patients, as well as offering their experience in the possible alternative use of immunomodulatory drugs.
32321878,The recent clinical trial reports pertaining to the efficacy of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine against COVID-19 albeit yet to be validated with larger clinical trials, have sparked much interest globally to evaluate whether this anti-malarial drug can be repurposed for the treatment of COVID-19.
32321878,In addition to its anti-viral activity, the anti-inflammatory activity of chloroquine may also contribute to its efficacy.
32321878,Based on our data obtained from an animal infection model of melioidosis (a disease caused by the bacteria Burkholderia pseudomallei), treatment with chloroquine can result in the phosphorylation and consequent inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β).
32321878,This serine/threonine protein kinase is now recognised as a point of convergence for host inflammatory response.
32321878,In view of this, it is plausible that the mechanism for the anti-inflammatory effect of chloroquine against COVID-19 involves inhibition of host GSK3β.
32321905,In late March and early April 2020, the antimalarial drug, chloroquine, has been approved as an emergency treatment for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the United States and in Europe.
32321905,Although infrequent, neuropsychiatric symptoms have been reported in patients who received chloroquine for the treatment of malaria or autoimmune diseases.
32321905,In this study, aiming to investigate these adverse events (AEs) using a large self-reporting database, we conducted a disproportionality analysis for the detection of neuropsychiatric AE signals associated with the use of chloroquine (or hydroxychloroquine), reported to FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database between the fourth quarter of 2012 and the fourth quarter of 2019.
32321905,We included 2,389,474 AE cases, among which 520 cases developed neuropsychiatric AE following the use of chloroquine.
32321905,Adjusted reporting odds ratio (ROR) for the development of each of the neuropsychiatric AEs following the use of chloroquine was calculated using a multilevel model: exposure to chloroquine was associated with a statistically significant high reporting of amnesia, delirium, hallucinations, depression, and loss of consciousness, (lower 95% confidence interval of the adjusted ROR &gt; 1), although the degree of increase in their ROR was limited.
32321905,There was no statistically significant high reporting of any other neuropsychiatric AE, including suicide, psychosis, confusion, and agitation.
32321905,Current pharmacovigilance study results did not suggest any potential link between the use of chloroquine and an increased risk of suicide, psychosis, confusion, and agitation, which would be informative during the emergency use of chloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19.
32322046,To evaluate the prevalence of malnutrition and its related factors in elderly patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China.
32322046,In a cross-sectional study, we evaluated the nutritional status of elderly inpatients with COVID-19 using the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA).
32322046,Based on MNA scores, patients were divided into non-malnutrition group (MNA ≥ 24), the group with risk of malnutrition (MNA 17-23.5) and malnutrition group (MNA score &lt; 17).
32322046,Regression analysis was conducted to screen for risk factors for malnutrition.
32322046,A total of 182 patients were included in the study, of which 27.5% were in the group with malnutrition risk and 52.7% were in the malnutrition group.
32322046,There were statistical differences in the incidence of comorbid diabetes mellitus, body mass index (BMI), calf circumference,albumin, hemoglobin, and lymphocyte counts among the three groups.
32322046,Further regression analysis suggested that combined diabetes, low calf circumference, and low albumin were independent risk factors for malnutrition.
32322046,The prevalence of malnutrition in elderly patients with COVID-19 was high, and nutritional support should be strengthened during treatment, especially for those with diabetes mellitus, low calf circumference, or low albumin.
32322146,Aerosolized medications are frequently administered across the health care continuum to acutely ill patients.
32322146,During viral pandemics, the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advise the application of airborne precautions when performing aerosol-generating medical procedures, such as aerosolized medications.
32322146,Appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), including fit-tested particulate respirators should be worn when administering nebulized medications to patients.
32322146,These PPEs have been in short supply in the US during early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, which is increasing the risk faced by health care workers (HCWs) who are treating patients using aerosolized medications.
32322146,Despite taking appropriate precautions, HCWs are becoming infected with COVID-19.
32322146,This may be related to secondary exposure related to viral longevity in fugitive emissions and viability on fomites.
32322146,We have expanded on non-US public health recommendations to provide guidance to frontline HCWs to enhance collaboration between clinicians, who are often siloed in their clinical practices, and ultimately to protect the federal workforce, which cannot sustain a significant loss of frontline HCWs.
32322400,Since the emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China, the number of globally confirmed cases according to World Health Organization statistics reached 292 124 in 189 countries by 22 March 2020.
32322400,The number of deaths reached 12 784, with estimated case-fatality rates ranging from 0.5% to 5.7%.
32322400,Children population seems to be the least affected by the disease, while the highest rate of death is among the elderly and people with comorbidities.
32322400,Most infected individuals are asymptomatic or only exhibit mild symptoms.
32322400,After the incubation period, the most common symptoms are fever, cough and fatigue.
32322400,Asymptomatic carrier state is of paramount importance because of carriers' ability to spread the infection and to shed the virus into the air and surroundings.
32322400,Although much is still unknown about SARS-CoV-2, the scientific research is moving at an unprecedented pace towards understanding the nature, effective control, prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
32322400,Various reports have suggested an <i>in vivo</i> evolution of the virus, which may explain the rapid spread and changing epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2, but further evidence is needed.
32322400,Unfortunately, no effective treatment or therapeutic drug is available for the disease; only supportive treatment and classical intervention measures are available for confronting the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
32322401,The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is highly pathogenic viral infection caused by SARS-CoV-2.
32322401,Currently, COVID-19 has caused global health concern.
32322401,It is assumed that COVID-19 has zoonotic origin based on the large number of infected people who were exposed to the wet market in Wuhan City, China.
32322401,The phylogenetic analysis has revealed that SARS-CoV-2 has significant sequence similarity with severe acute respiratory syndrome-like (SARS-like) bat viruses, thus bats could be primary possible reservoir.
32322401,The intermediate host and there subsequent transfer is not known yet, although human to human transfer is widely confirmed.
32322401,The transmission of COVID-19 infection from one person to another resulted in the isolation of patients who were subsequently given a variety of treatments.
32322401,To monitor the current outbreak, robust steps have been taken around the globe to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 infection particularly banning international and domestic flights, inducting lockdowns in vulnerable areas, social distancing etc.
32322401,No clinically approved antiviral drug or vaccine against COVID-19 is reported yet.
32322401,However, in clinical trials, few broad-spectrum antiviral drugs were evaluated against COVID-19 infection which resulted in clinical recovery.
32322401,In this article emergence and pathogenicity of COVID-19 infection along with potential therapeutic strategies are analyzed to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.
32322402,Covid-19 disease is caused by SARS-CoV-2, a virus belonging to the coronavirus family.
32322402,Covid-19 is so new that there is currently no specific vaccine or treatment.
32322402,Clinical trials are currently underway.
32322402,In vitro tests are also being conducted to assess the efficacy of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of this epidemic, which is considered a pandemic by the WHO.
32322402,We note that the content of this review is dated.
32322402,The information it contains is subject to change and modification as the epidemic progresses.
32322478,Infection with COVID-19 potentially can result in severe outcomes and death from &quot;cytokine storm syndrome&quot;, resulting in novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) with severe dyspnea, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), fulminant myocarditis and multiorgan dysfunction with or without disseminated intravascular coagulation.
32322478,No published treatment to date has been shown to adequately control the inflammation and respiratory symptoms associated with COVID-19, apart from oxygen therapy and assisted ventilation.
32322478,We evaluated the effects of using high dose oral and/or IV glutathione in the treatment of 2 patients with dyspnea secondary to COVID-19 pneumonia.
32322478,Two patients living in New York City (NYC) with a history of Lyme and tick-borne co-infections experienced a cough and dyspnea and demonstrated radiological findings consistent with novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP).
32322478,A trial of 2 g of PO or IV glutathione was used in both patients and improved their dyspnea within 1 h of use.
32322478,Repeated use of both 2000 mg of PO and IV glutathione was effective in further relieving respiratory symptoms.
32322478,Oral and IV glutathione, glutathione precursors (N-acetyl-cysteine) and alpha lipoic acid may represent a novel treatment approach for blocking NFKappaB and addressing &quot;cytokine storm syndrome&quot; and respiratory distress in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.
32322486,The recent outbreak of Covid19 has required urgent treatments for numerous patients.
32322486,No suitable vaccines or antivirals are available for Covid19.
32322486,The efficiency against Covid19 of WHO therapies of choice, that are two antivirals developed for other pathologies, is controversial.
32322486,Therefore, alternative approaches are required.
32322486,Intravenous (IV) Vitamin C (Vit-C) has emerged as one of the other alternatives for this purpose.
32322486,Here we review the effects of IV Vit-C on the immune system response, the antiviral properties of IV Vit-C, and finally the antioxidant properties of IV Vit-C to specifically address the cytokines' storm characteristic of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) that occur in the later cycle of the Covid19 infectious disease.
32322758,The COVID-19 pandemic will consume significant health care resources.
32322758,Given concerns for rapidly rising infection rates in the US, impending staffing shortages, and potential for resource re-allocation, we rapidly re-evaluated our rectal cancer practice polices during this public health emergency.
32322758,Previous to the pandemic we commonly utilized total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) with a strong preference for long course chemoradiation (LCCRT).
32322758,In the setting of the ongoing pandemic we now mandate short course radiation therapy (SCRT).
32322758,Despite multiple randomized trials demonstrating no difference in locoregional recurrence, distant recurrence, or overall survival between SCRT and LRCCT, adaptation of SCRT in the United States has been low given concerns for less tumor downstaging and increased toxicity.
32322758,In the setting of the ongoing and likely prolonged COVID-19 pandemic, we feel that these concerns must be re-evaluated, as SCRT presents a well-validated alternative that will allow us to meet the needs of a greater number of potentially curable patients, at a time when our resources are severely and acutely constrained.
32322988,With the COVID-19 pandemic, emergency rooms are faced with major challenges because they act as the interface between outpatient and inpatient care.
32322988,The dynamics of the pandemic forced emergency care at the University Hospital Münster to extensively adjust their processes, which had to be carried out in the shortest time possible.
32322988,This included the establishment of an outpatient coronavirus test center and a medical student-operated telephone hotline.
32322988,Inside the hospital, new isolation capacities in the emergency room and a dedicated COVID-19 ward were set up.
32322988,The patient flow was reorganized using flow diagrams for both the outpatient and inpatient areas.
32322988,The general and special emergency management was optimized for the efficient treatment of COVID-19-positive patients and the staff were trained in the use of protective equipment.
32322988,This report of our experience is intended to support other emergency departments in their preparation for the COVID-19 pandemic.
32323279,Twenty years ago, an enzyme homologous to the previously known angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) was identified, and subsequently named ACE2.
32323279,In the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), ACE2 has counter-regulatory functions against the classical effector peptide angiotensin II, for example in blood pressure regulation and cardiovascular remodeling.
32323279,However, ACE2 provides an initially unexpected interesting link between virology and cardiovascular medicine.
32323279,That is, ACE2 represents the binding receptor for the cellular uptake of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 viruses.
32323279,Thus, ACE2 is relevant for COVID-19.
32323279,In this context, it was suspected that therapy with RAS blockers might promote transmission and complications of COVID-19 by upregulation of ACE2 expression.
32323279,The aim of this short review is, to describe the link between the RAS, particularly ACE2, and COVID-19.
32323279,Based on our analysis and evaluation of the available findings, we justify our conclusion: important drugs such as ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers should continue to be prescribed according to guidelines to stable patients in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.
32323287,Against the background of the pandemic caused by infection with the SARS-CoV-2, the German Society for Pneumology and Respiratory Medicine (DGP e.V.), in cooperation with other associations, has designated a team of experts in order to answer the currently pressing questions about therapy strategies in dealing with COVID-19 patients suffering from acute respiratory insufficiency (ARI).
32323287,The position paper is based on the current knowledge that is evolving daily.
32323287,Many of the published and cited studies require further review, also because many of them did not undergo standard review processes.Therefore, this position paper is also subject to a continuous review process and will be further developed in cooperation with the other professional societies.This position paper is structured into the following five topics:1.
32323287,Pathophysiology of acute respiratory insufficiency in patients without immunity infected with SARS-CoV-22.
32323287,Temporal course and prognosis of acute respiratory insufficiency during the course of the disease3.
32323287,Oxygen insufflation, high-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation and invasive ventilation with special consideration of infectious aerosol formation4.
32323287,Non-invasive ventilation in ARI5.
32323287,Supply continuum for the treatment of ARIKey points have been highlighted as core statements and significant observations.
32323287,Regarding the pathophysiological aspects of acute respiratory insufficiency (ARI), the pulmonary infection with SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19 runs through three phases: early infection, pulmonary manifestation and severe hyperinflammatory phase.There are differences between advanced COVID-19-induced lung damage and those changes seen in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndromes (ARDS) as defined by the Berlin criteria.
32323287,In a pathophysiologically plausible - but currently not yet histopathologically substantiated - model, two types (L-type and H-type) are distinguished, which correspond to an early and late phase.
32323287,This distinction can be taken into consideration in the differential instrumentation in the therapy of ARI.The assessment of the extent of ARI should be carried out by an arterial or capillary blood gas analysis under room air conditions and must include the calculation of the oxygen supply (measured from the variables of oxygen saturation, the Hb value, the corrected values of the Hüfner number and the cardiac output).
32323287,In principle, aerosols can cause transmission of infectious viral particles.
32323287,Open systems or leakage systems (so-called vented masks) can prevent the release of respirable particles.
32323287,Procedures in which the invasive ventilation system must be opened, and endotracheal intubation must be carried out are associated with an increased risk of infection.The protection of personnel with personal protective equipment should have very high priority because fear of contagion must not be a primary reason for intubation.
32323287,If the specifications for protective equipment (eye protection, FFP2 or FFP-3 mask, gown) are adhered to, inhalation therapy, nasal high-flow (NHF) therapy, CPAP therapy or NIV can be carried out according to the current state of knowledge without increased risk of infection to the staff.
32323287,A significant proportion of patients with respiratory failure presents with relevant hypoxemia, often also caused by a high inspiratory oxygen fraction (FiO2) including NHF, and this hypoxemia cannot be not completely corrected.
32323287,In this situation, CPAP/NIV therapy can be administered under use of a mouth and nose mask or a respiratory helmet as therapy escalation, as long as the criteria for endotracheal intubation are not fulfilled.In acute hypoxemic respiratory insufficiency, NIV should be performed in an intensive care unit or in a comparable unit by personnel with appropriate expertise.
32323287,Under CPAP/NIV, a patient can deteriorate rapidly.
32323287,For this reason, continuous monitoring with readiness to carry out intubation must be ensured at all times.
32323287,If CPAP/NIV leads to further progression of ARI, intubation and subsequent invasive ventilation should be carried out without delay if no DNI order is in place.In the case of patients in whom invasive ventilation, after exhausting all guideline-based measures, is not sufficient, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation procedure (ECMO) should be considered to ensure sufficient oxygen supply and to remove CO<sub>2</sub>.
32323287,Vor dem Hintergrund der Pandemie durch Infektionen mit dem SARS-CoV-2 hat die Deutsche Gesellschaft für Pneumologie und Beatmungsmedizin (DGP e.V.) federführend in Kooperation mit weiteren Verbänden ein Expertenteam benannt, um die zur Zeit drängenden Fragen zu Therapiestrategien im Umgang mit COVID-19-Patienten, die an akut respiratorischer Insuffizienz (ARI) leiden, zu beantworten.
32323287,Das Positionspapier basiert auf dem momentanen aktuellen Wissen, das sich täglich weiterentwickelt.
32323287,Viele der publizierten und zitierten Studien bedürfen weiterer Überprüfungen, auch weil viele kein übliches Review-Verfahren durchlaufen haben Daher unterliegt auch dieses Positionspapier einer ständigen Überprüfung und wird in Zusammenarbeit in der Zusammenarbeit mit den anderen Fachgesellschaften weiterentwickelt.Dieses Positionspapier wurde in die folgenden fünf Themenfelder gegliedert:1.
32323287,Pathophysiologie der akuten respiratorischen Insuffizienz bei Infektionen mit SARS-CoV-2 bei Patienten ohne Immunität2.
32323287,Zeitlicher Verlauf und Prognose der akuten respiratorischen Insuffizienz im Laufe der Erkrankung3.
32323287,Sauerstoff-Insufflation, High-Flow Sauerstoff, nicht-invasive Beatmung und invasive Beatmung unter besonderer Berücksichtigung der infektiösen Aerosolbildung4.
32323287,Nicht-Invasive Beatmung bei der ARI5.
32323287,Versorgungskontinuum zur Behandlung der ARIZentrale Punkte wurden hierbei als Kernaussagen und Feststellungen herausgehoben.
32323287,Bezüglich pathophysiologischer Aspekte der akuten respiratorischen Insuffizienz (ARI) verläuft die pulmonale Infektion mit SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19 in drei Phasen: Frühe Infektion, pulmonale Manifestation und schwere hyperinflammatorische Phase.Der fortgeschrittene COVID-19-induzierte Lungenschaden weist häufig Unterschiede zu den bekannten Veränderungen entsprechend der Definition des Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) nach den Berlin-Kriterien auf.In einem pathophysiologisch plausiblen – zur Zeit aber noch nicht histopathologisch untermauerten – Modell wird in zwei Typen (L-Typ und H-Typ) unterschieden, die einer frühen und späten Phase entsprechen.
32323287,Diese Unterscheidung kann für die apparative Differenzialtherapie der ARI erwogen werden.Die Einschätzung des Ausmaßes der ARI soll durch eine arterielle oder kapilläre Blutgasanalyse bei Raumluft erfolgen und die Errechnung des Sauerstoffangebotes (bemisst sich aus den Variablen der Sauerstoffsättigung, des Hb-Wertes, der Hüfnerʼschen Korrekturzahl sowie des Herzminutenvolumens) beinhalten.Durch Aerosole ist eine Übertragung von infektiösen, Viren-haltigen Partikeln prinzipiell möglich.
32323287,Offene Systeme bzw.
32323287,Leckage-Systeme (sog. vented Masken) können die Abgabe von respirablen Partikeln erhöhen.
32323287,Prozeduren, bei denen das invasive Beatmungssystem geöffnet werden muss, sowie die endotracheale Intubation sind mit einem erhöhten Infektionsrisiko verbunden.Der Schutz des Personals durch persönliche Schutzausrüstung soll sehr hohe Priorität haben, weil die Angst vor Ansteckung kein primärer Intubationsgrund sein darf.
32323287,Bei Einhaltung der Vorgaben zu Schutzausrüstung (Augenschutz, FFP2- bzw.
32323287,FFP-3 Maske, Kittel) kann eine Inhalationstherapie, nasale High Flow (NHF) -Therapie, eine CPAP-Therapie oder eine NIV nach jetzigem Kenntnisstand vom Personal ohne erhöhtes Infektionsrisiko durchgeführt werden.Ein signifikanter Anteil der respiratorisch insuffizienten Patienten präsentiert sich mit einer relevanten Hypoxämie, die häufig auch durch eine hohe inspiratorische Sauerstofffraktion (FiO2) inklusive NHF nicht vollständig korrigiert werden kann.In dieser Situation können die CPAP/NIV-Therapie unter Verwendung einer Mund-Nasen-Maske oder eines Beatmungshelms als Therapieeskalation durchgeführt werden, solange die Kriterien für eine endotracheale Intubation nicht erfüllt sind.Die NIV bei akuter hypoxämischer Insuffizienz sollte auf der Intensivstation oder in einer vergleichbaren Struktur mit entsprechender personeller Expertise erfolgen.
32323287,Unter CPAP/NIV kann es zu einer raschen Verschlechterung kommen.
32323287,Aus diesem Grund soll ein ständiges Monitoring unter ständiger Intubationsbereitschaft gewährleistet sein.
32323287,Kommt es unter CPAP/NIV zur weiteren Progression des ARI, sollte ohne zeitliche Verzögerung die Intubation und nachfolgende invasive Beatmung erfolgen, wenn keine DNI-Order vorliegt.Bei Patienten, bei denen eine invasive Beatmung unter Ausschöpfung aller leitliniengerechter Maßnahmen nicht ausreicht, um eine ausreichende Sauerstoffaufnahme und CO<sub>2</sub>-Abgabe zu gewährleisten, soll ein extrakorporales Lungenersatzverfahren erwogen werden (ECMO).
32323460,The ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has a drastic impact on national health care systems.
32323460,Given the overwhelming demand on facility capacity, the impact on all health care sectors has to be addressed.
32323460,Solid organ transplantation represents a field with a high demand on staff, intensive care units, and follow-up facilities.
32323460,The great therapeutic value of organ transplantation has to be weighed against mandatory constraints of health care capacities.
32323460,In addition, the management of immunosuppressed recipients has to be reassessed during the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
32323460,In addressing these crucial questions, transplant physicians are facing a total lack of scientific evidence.
32323460,Therefore, the aim of this study was to offer an approach of consensus-based guidance, derived from individual information of 22 transplant societies.
32323460,Key recommendations were extracted and the degree of consensus among different organizations was calculated.
32323460,A high degree of consensus was found for temporarily suspending nonurgent transplant procedures and living donation programs.
32323460,Systematic polymerase chain reaction-based testing of donors and recipients was broadly recommended.
32323460,Additionally, more specific aspects (eg, screening of surgical explant teams and restricted use of marginal donor organs) were included in our analysis.
32323460,This study offers a novel approach to informed guidance for health care management when a priori no scientific evidence is available.
32323646,The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 pandemic has spread to Africa, where nearly all countries have reported laboratory-confirmed cases of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
32323646,Although there are ongoing clinical trials of repurposed and investigational antiviral and immune-based therapies, there are as yet no scientifically proven, clinically effective pharmacological treatments for COVID-19.
32323646,Among the repurposed drugs, the commonly used antimalarials chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have become the focus of global scientific, media, and political attention despite a lack of randomized clinical trials supporting their efficacy.
32323646,Chloroquine has been used worldwide for about 75 years and is listed by the WHO as an essential medicine to treat malaria.
32323646,Hydroxychloroquine is mainly used as a therapy for autoimmune diseases.
32323646,However, the efficacy and safety of CQ/HCQ for the treatment of COVID-19 remains to be defined.
32323646,Indiscriminate promotion and widespread use of CQ/HCQ have led to extensive shortages, self-treatment, and fatal overdoses.
32323646,Shortages and increased market prices leave all countries vulnerable to substandard and falsified medical products, and safety issues are especially concerning for Africa because of its healthcare system limitations.
32323646,Much needed in Africa is a cross-continental collaborative network for coordinated production, distribution, and post-marketing surveillance aligned to low-cost distribution of any approved COVID-19 drug; this would ideally be piggybacked on existing global aid efforts.
32323646,Meanwhile, African countries should strongly consider implementing prescription monitoring schemes to ensure that any off-label CQ/HCQ use is appropriate and beneficial during this pandemic.
32323974,The outbreak of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been a challenge for hospital laboratories because of the huge number of samples that must be tested for the presence of the causative pathogen, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32323974,Simple and rapid immunodiagnostic methods are urgently needed to identify positive cases.
32323974,Here we report the development of a rapid and sensitive lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) that uses lanthanide-doped polysterene nanoparticles (LNPs) to detect anti-SARV-CoV-2 IgG in human serum.
32323974,A recombinant nucleocapsid phosphoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 was dispensed onto a nitrocellulose membrane to capture specific IgG.
32323974,Mouse anti-human IgG antibody was labeled with self-assembled LNPs that served as a fluorescent reporter.
32323974,A 100-μL aliquot of serum samples (1:1000 dilution) was used for this assay and the whole detection process took 10 min.
32323974,The results of the validation experiment met the requirements for clinical diagnostic reagents.
32323974,A value of 0.0666 was defined as the cutoff value by assaying 51 normal samples.
32323974,We tested 7 samples that were positive by reverse-transcription (RT-)PCR and 12 that were negative but clinically suspicious for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG.
32323974,One of the negative samples was determined to be SARS-CoV-2 IgG positive, while the results for the other samples were consistent with those obtained by RT-PCR.
32323974,Thus, this assay can achieve rapid and sensitive detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in human serum and allow positive identification in suspicious cases; it can also be useful for monitoring the progression COVID-19 and evaluating patients' response to treatment.
32324101,A potential link between mortality, D-dimer values and a prothrombotic syndrome has been reported in patients with COVID-19 infection.
32324101,The National Institute for Public Health of the Netherlands asked a group of Radiology and Vascular Medicine experts to provide guidance for the imaging workup and treatment of these important complications.
32324101,This report summarizes evidence for thromboembolic disease, potential diagnostic and preventive actions as well as recommendations for patients with COVID-19 infection.
32324209,Data are lacking whether patients with hypertension who are taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have increased severity or risk of mortality during hospitalization for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32324209,To investigate the association between ACEIs/ARBs and severity of illness and mortality in patients with hypertension hospitalized for COVID-19 infection.
32324209,Retrospective, single-center case series of the 1178 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infections at the Central Hospital of Wuhan, China, from January 15 to March 15, 2020.
32324209,COVID-19 was confirmed by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and epidemiologic, clinical, radiologic, laboratory, and drug therapy data were analyzed in all patients.
32324209,The percentage of patients with hypertension taking ACEIs/ARBs was compared between those with severe vs nonsevere illness and between survivors vs nonsurvivors.
32324209,Of the 1178 patients with COVID-19, the median age was 55.5 years (interquartile range, 38-67 years) and 545 (46.3%) were men.
32324209,The overall in-hospital mortality was 11.0%.
32324209,There were 362 patients with hypertension (30.7% of the total group; median age, 66.0 years [interquartile range, 59-73 years]; 189 [52.2%] were men), of whom 115 (31.8%) were taking ACEI/ARBs.
32324209,The in-hospital mortality in the patients with hypertension was 21.3%.
32324209,The percentage of patients with hypertension taking ACEIs/ARBs did not differ between those with severe and nonsevere infections (32.9% vs 30.7%; P = .65) nor did it differ between nonsurvivors and survivors (27.3% vs 33.0%; P = .34).
32324209,Similar findings were observed when data were analyzed for patients taking ACEIs and those taking ARBs.
32324209,This study provides clinical data on the association between ACEIs/ARBs and outcomes in patients with hypertension hospitalized with COVID-19 infections, suggesting that ACEIs/ARBs are not associated with the severity or mortality of COVID-19 in such patients.
32324209,These data support current guidelines and societal recommendations for treating hypertension during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32324352,This paper discusses the possible effects of comedication on COVID-19 and the current treatment options for this infection.
32324352,It is very doubtful that comedication has a disadvantageous effect on the course of the disease.
32324352,NSAIDs should be avoided in any patient with a possible severe disease, because of potential side effects.
32324352,Inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system should be continued when there is a solid indication, and stopped in case of hemodynamic problems.
32324352,There is no preference for either ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor inhibitors.
32324352,Currently, chloroquine and remdesivir are possible treatment options.
32324352,There is no sound evidence for either treatment.
32324352,Chloroquine has side effects (nausea, QT prolongation) and there are several drug interactions.
32324352,The treatment should be reconsidered in the event of side effects and when inferior medication for comorbidity must be prescribed because of possible interactions.
32324352,Lopinavir/ritonavir is not effective.
32324352,Supportive care is at present the mainstay of the treatment.
32324357,Due to the coronavirus epidemic, healthcare systems face growing challenges all around the world nowadays.
32324357,These challenges are the most critical in the field of intensive treatment and anesthesiology.
32324357,One of the most important prerequisites of effective critical care treatment is preserving the involved healthcare workers from the infection, by providing them with detailed practical advices on the preventive measures and treatment strategies.
32324357,The aim of the present review is to summarize the most important related knowledge available from previous experiences.

32324357,A COVID–19 vírussal kapcsolatos fertőzés ellátása egyre nagyobb kihívás elé állítja a hazai egészségügyi ellátórendszert és különösen a kritikus állapotú betegek ellátásáért felelős aneszteziológiai és intenzív terápiás szakmát.
32324357,A hatékony ellátás elengedhetetlen feltétele az intenzív osztályos egészségügyi személyzet megóvása a fertőzés terjedésétől a mindennapi betegellátás során és az ezekkel kapcsolatos ismeretek széles körben való ismertté tétele.
32324357,A szerzők gyakorlati szempontok alapján összefoglalják a COVID–19-betegek intenzív ellátásával kapcsolatos legfontosabb szervezési, kezelési és megelőzési teendőket.

32324359,In December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown origin occured in Wuhan, China.
32324359,The identified infective agent is a novel corona virus called “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2” (SARS-CoV-2) and the respiratory disease caused by this agent aquired the name “coronavirus disease 2019” (COVID-19).
32324359,In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.
32324359,We reviewed the international literature regarding the novel coronavirus outbreak.
32324359,Here below, we focus mainly on the diagnostic issues of COVID-19 and on the estimation of the prognosis.
32324359,We detail the relevant anamnestic factors and initial examination results which serve as basics for the clinical suspicion of COVID-19.
32324359,We also focus on the proper method of microbiological sampling and the relevant informations regarding diagnostic tests like the gold standard real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2.
32324359,We also cite the current national epidemiologic regulations of testing for novel coronavirus.
32324359,In the last section, we emphasize the importance and the potential way of early identification of high-risk patients.
32324359,The COVID-19 pandemic may cause substantial epidemiological and healthcare burden even in Hungary.
32324359,In addition to the epidemiologic interventions aiming the deceleration of the outbreak, the early identification and the correct hospital treatment remain key issues since these may influence mortality.
32324359,The chances of the critically ill patients could be improved solely by a high-quality and careful critical care.
32324359,It is prudent to meet the experiences of colleagues working hard with these patients in the already heavily infected countries.
32324359,Orv Hetil.
32324359,2020; 161(17): 667–671. 2019 decemberében új koronavírus okozta járvány ütötte fel a fejét a kínai Wuhanban.
32324359,Az azonosított kórokozó egy új koronavírus, melyet „severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2”-nek, azaz SARS-CoV-2-nek neveztek el, az általa kiváltott légzési tünetegyüttes pedig a „coronavirus disease 2019”, azaz COVID–19 nevet kapta.
32324359,Az Egészségügyi Világszervezet (WHO) a járványt 2020 márciusában pandémiává minősítette.
32324359,Áttekintettük a jelenleg elérhető nemzetközi irodalmat a COVID–19-járvány vonatkozásában.
32324359,Írásunkban az új koronavírus diagnosztikájára és prognosztikájára vonatkozó releváns információkat összegezzük.
32324359,Részletezzük a klinikai gyanú felvetéséhez szükséges anamnesztikus tényezőket és kezdeti vizsgálati eredményeket, a mikrobiológiai mintavétel módját, a molekuláris diagnosztikai tesztre – az arany standardnak minősülő ’real-time’ reverztranszkriptáz polimeráz-láncreakcióra (RT-PCR) – vonatkozó alapvető információkat, különös tekintettel a diagnosztikus tesztelést érintő, jelenleg érvényben lévő népegészségügyi szabályozásra.
32324359,Hangsúlyt fektetünk továbbá a nagy rizikójú betegek paramétereire és felismerésük módjára.
32324359,A COVID–19-pandémia Magyarországon is jelentős járványügyi és egészségügyi következményekkel járhat.
32324359,A járvány lassítására irányuló epidemiológiai intézkedéseken túl a már fertőzött személyek időbeli felismerése és megfelelő kórházi ellátása mortalitási szempontból is kulcskérdés.
32324359,A kritikus állapotú betegek esélyeit csak magas minőségű, körültekintő intenzív terápiás ellátással lehet javítani, s hogy a legjobbat tudjuk nyújtani, hasznos, ha felhasználjuk a már endémiás országokban dolgozó orvoskollégák tapasztalatait.

32324359,2020; 160(17): 667–671.
32324361,There is currently no proven effective therapy for COVID-19.
32324361,Here we discuss the drugs most investigated for the treatment of the disease.
32324361,All the listed therapies are experimental at this stage.
32324361,However, due to the severe healthcare effects of the pandemic and the potentially fatal outcome of COVID-19 patients treated in the intensive care units, their off-label use should none-the-less be considered.
32324361,Orv Hetil.
32324361,2020; 161(17): 685–688.
32324361,Jelenleg a COVID–19 kezelésére bizonyítottan hatékony terápia nem áll rendelkezésre.
32324361,Az alábbiakban a teljesség igénye nélkül az ilyen vonatkozásban leginkább vizsgált gyógyszerek kerülnek bemutatásra.
32324361,A felsorolt terápiás lehetőségek mindegyike kísérletinek tekintendő ebben a fázisban.
32324361,Tekintettel a járvány súlyos népegészségügyi hatásaira, illetve az intenzív osztályon kezelt COVID–19-betegek potenciálisan fatális kimenetelére, ’off-label’ alkalmazásuk mégis megfontolandó.
32324361,Orv Hetil.
32324361,2020; 161(17): 685–688.
32324364,Caring for those affected by the coronavirus outbreak of December 2019 imposed a heavy burden on healthcare systems.
32324364,Not only because some patients require intensive care, but because patients with any form of the disease may need surgical intervention.
32324364,Managing these cases is a major challenge for anesthesiologists.
32324364,The purpose of this summary is to present the practical aspects of anesthetic and perioperative care for patients requiring surgical treatment.

32324364,2020; 161(17): 692–695.
32324364,A 2019 decemberében kitört koronavírus-fertőzéses világjárványban megbetegedettek ellátása jelentős terhet ró az egészségügyre.
32324364,Nemcsak azért, mert a betegek egy része intenzív terápiás ellátást igényel, hanem mert a betegség bármely súlyossági formájában szenvedő betegeknek sebészi kezelésre is szükségük lehet.
32324364,Ennek megoldása pedig jelentős kihívás elé állítja az aneszteziológusokat.
32324364,Ezen összefoglaló a sebészi kezelést igénylő betegek aneszteziológiai és perioperatív ellátásának gyakorlati aspektusait hivatott bemutatni.
32324364,Orv Hetil.
32324364,2020; 161(17): 692–695.
32324365,The coronavirus pandemic is a serious challenge for healthcare workers worldwide.
32324365,The virus is spread through the air by droplets of moisture when people cough or sneeze and it has a very high virulence.
32324365,Procedures generating airway aerosols are dangerous for every participant of patient care.
32324365,The serious form of coronavirus infection can cause progressive respiratory failure.
32324365,The best treatment is early endotracheal intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation.
32324365,Intubation is an aerosol-generating process and thus carries the risk of contamination.
32324365,Additionally the airway management of this patient population is usually difficult.
32324365,The goal of this article is to give a practice-based overview of the peculiarities of airway management in coronavirus-infected patients with special regard to infection control and patient safety considerations.
32324365,Orv Hetil.
32324365,2020; 161(17): 696–703.
32324365,A világunkon végigvonuló koronavírus-járvány számos kihívással szembesíti az egészségügyben dolgozókat.
32324365,A vírus cseppfertőzéssel terjed, és magas a virulenciája, ezért minden olyan beavatkozás, mely légúti aeroszolképződést generál, potenciálisan veszélyezteti az ellátásban részt vevők egészségét.
32324365,A koronavírus-fertőzés súlyos formája progresszív légzési elégtelenséggel jár, melynek ellátásában a korai endotrachealis intubáció és invazív gépi lélegeztetés elengedhetetlen.
32324365,Az intubáció során fokozott a légúti aeroszolképződés veszélye, így magas az ellátó személyzet fertőződésének veszélye.
32324365,Az előzőeken túl ezen betegeknél relatíve gyakori a nehéz légútbiztosítás is.
32324365,Cikkünk célja, hogy gyakorlatorientált áttekintést adjon a koronavírussal fertőzött betegek légútbiztosításának specialitásairól, különös tekintettel az infekciókontroll és a betegbiztonság szempontjaira.

32324365,2020; 161(17): 696–703.
32324366,In critically ill COVID-19 patients, the failure of the cardiorespiratory system can be due to one of the following: (1) cytokine storm, haemophagocytosis – septic shock, (2) unmanageable hypoxemia, (3) isolated organ failure or as part of multi-organ failure.
32324366,Herein we give an overview of the therapeutic options for treating or preventing these disease states.
32324366,In recent years, CytoSorb-haemoperfusion to remove cytokines has shown promising results in the treatment of septic shock.
32324366,Inhalational nitric oxide (iNO), inhalational epoprostenol and veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) are options in severe hypoxemia that is unresponsive to conventional mechanical ventilation.
32324366,Renal failure is a frequent component of the multi-organ failure usually seen with disease progression and necessitates starting one of the available continuous renal replacement modalities.
32324366,Orv Hetil.
32324366,2020; 161(17): 704–709.
32324366,A COVID–19-fertőzéses, kritikus állapotba került betegek körében a cardiorespiratoricus rendszer összeomlása a következő mechanizmusok útján történhet: (1) citokinvihar, haemophagocytosis – szeptikus sokk, (2) uralhatatlan hypoxaemia, (3) specifikus szervelégtelenségek, illetve többszervi elégtelenség részjelenségeként.
32324366,Ebben az összefoglalóban a fenti állapotok ellátásának és megelőzésének jelenleg rendelkezésre álló terápiás opcióit tekintjük át.
32324366,A szeptikus sokk kezelésére az utóbbi években egyre gyakrabban és biztató sikerességgel kerül alkalmazásra a citokinek eltávolítása CytoSorb-haemoperfusióval.
32324366,A konvencionális, mechanikus lélegeztetéssel már nem kezelhető hypoxaemia esetén szóba jön az inhalált nitrogén-oxid (iNO), az inhalációs formában bejuttatott epoprosztenol és a venovenosus extracorporalis membránoxigenizáció (VV-ECMO).
32324366,A többnyire késői fázisban fellépő szervelégtelenségek gyakori komponense az akut veseelégtelenség, amely a rendelkezésre álló folyamatos vesepótló kezelések valamelyikének indítását igényli.

32324366,2020; 161(17): 704–709.
32324533,The presented work summarizes the results of studies underlining the crucial role of estrogen receptor (ER) signaling in both innate and adaptive immune responses as well as in tissue repairing processes during respiratory virus infection.
32324533,Experimental studies justify that among respiratory virus infected mice, a weaker ER signaling leads to increased morbidity and mortality in both males and females.
32324533,In animal experiments, estrogen treatment silences the inflammatory reactions and decreases virus titers leading to improved survival rate; it seems to be an ideal prevention and therapy against COVID-19.
32324533,We should overcome the widespread reluctance to estrogen therapy as we have a unique estrogen formula; conjugated estrogens, or conjugated equine estrogens available under the brand name of Premarin deriving from natural sources.
32324533,Premarin can exert similar ER upregulative and gene repairing power like endogenous estrogen without any risk for adverse reactions.
32324533,Premarin is capable of stopping the COVID-19 pandemic.
32324720,On January 19, 2020, the state of Washington reported the first U.S. laboratory-confirmed case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2 (1).
32324720,As of April 19, a total of 720,630 COVID-19 cases and 37,202 associated deaths* had been reported to CDC from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and four U.S. territories (2).
32324720,CDC recommends, with precautions, the proper cleaning and disinfection of high-touch surfaces to help mitigate the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (3).
32324720,To assess whether there might be a possible association between COVID-19 cleaning recommendations from public health agencies and the media and the number of chemical exposures reported to the National Poison Data System (NPDS), CDC and the American Association of Poison Control Centers surveillance team compared the number of exposures reported for the period January-March 2020 with the number of reports during the same 3-month period in 2018 and 2019.
32324720,Fifty-five poison centers in the United States provide free, 24-hour professional advice and medical management information regarding exposures to poisons, chemicals, drugs, and medications.
32324720,Call data from poison centers are uploaded in near real-time to NPDS.
32324720,During January-March 2020, poison centers received 45,550 exposure calls related to cleaners (28,158) and disinfectants (17,392), representing overall increases of 20.4% and 16.4% from January-March 2019 (37,822) and January-March 2018 (39,122), respectively.
32324720,Although NPDS data do not provide information showing a definite link between exposures and COVID-19 cleaning efforts, there appears to be a clear temporal association with increased use of these products.
32324898,To evaluate the incidence, type, and risk factors associated with adverse drug reactions (ADRs) among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by Hospital Pharmacovigilance System (CHPS).
32324898,A retrospective analysis was performed on 217 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the First Hospital of Changsha in China, from January 17, 2020, to February 29, 2020.
32324898,The active monitoring model in CHPS was used to detect ADR signals of the hospital information system.
32324898,The risk factors for the ADRs were classified using the World Health Organization-Uppsala Monitoring Centre (WHO-UMC) system.
32324898,Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were carried out to analyze the risk factors of ADRs.
32324898,Our results showed that the prevalence of ADRs was 37.8% in the patients, which was predominated by drug-induced gastrointestinal disorders and liver system disorders (23.0% vs.
32324898,13.8%).
32324898,The ADR could be explained by the use of lopinavir/ ritonavir and umifenovir by 63.8% and 18.1%, respectively.
32324898,There were 96.8% of ADRs that occurred within 14 days of hospitalization.
32324898,Multivariable analysis showed that length of stay (odds ratio (OR): 2.02; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03-3.96; P = 0.04), number of drugs used in the hospital (OR: 3.17; 95% CI 1.60-6.27; P = 0.001) and underlying basic diseases (OR: 2.07; 95% CI 1.02-4.23; P = 0.04) were independent risk factor for ADRs in the patients.
32324898,Together, the incidence of ADRs was significantly high during the treatment period.
32324898,Moreover, the active monitoring of the CHPS system reflected ADRs during COVID-19 treatment in the real world, which provided reference for safe medication in the clinic.
32324951,The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection is spreading at an alarming rate and has created an unprecedented health emergency around the globe.
32324951,There is no effective vaccine or approved drug treatment against COVID-19 and other pathogenic coronaviruses.
32324951,The development of antiviral agents is an urgent priority.
32324951,Biochemical events critical to the coronavirus replication cycle provided a number of attractive targets for drug development.
32324951,These include, spike protein for binding to host cell-surface receptors, proteolytic enzymes that are essential for processing polyproteins into mature viruses, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase for RNA replication.
32324951,There has been a lot of ground work for drug discovery and development against these targets.
32324951,Also, high-throughput screening efforts have led to the identification of diverse lead structures, including natural product-derived molecules.
32324951,This review highlights past and present drug discovery and medicinal-chemistry approaches against SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and COVID-19 targets.
32324951,The review hopes to stimulate further research and will be a useful guide to the development of effective therapies against COVID-19 and other pathogenic coronaviruses.
32324985,The outbreak caused by SARS-CoV-2 beta-coronavirus, first identified in Wuhan, China, was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on 11th March, 2020.
32324985,In Hungary, the first confirmed COVID-19 case was reported on 4th March, 2020, and on 15th March, the first fatality related to the infection was announced.
32324985,At the moment of the latter event, there was no central, standardized guideline, which could explain the necessary precautions, and provide an unequivocal description on how to handle the dead body.
32324985,The procedure of transportation, storage, occurent autopsy or final disposition of the deceased raise a lot of questions, especially on how to carry out these tasks.
32324985,Legislation related to infectious diseases and decedent management in general do not provide enough information on how to perform duties in a COVID-19 fatality case.
32324985,The chief medical officer suspended the execution of autopsies, except in cases of unnatural death, since 19th March, however, the transportation and storage of fatalities can still be a problem.
32324985,The Department of Pathology of the Healthcare Professional College of the Ministry of Human capacities published a procedure on recommended post-mortem duties on 21st March, but the suggested protocols only represent a narrow spectrum of international recommendations.
32324985,Therefore supplementation may be necessary.
32324985,Sadly, post-mortem protocols, in spite of their importance, are also underrepresented in the international literature.
32324985,A further problem, wich makes adoptability difficult, is that available foreign guidelines and algorithms are optimized for different legislation, and organisations, resources not available in our country.
32324985,In this article, besides providing a summary of literature, we would also like to make practical recommendations which may increase the safety of healthcare providers participating in the treatment or pathological duties with COVID-19 suspected, probable and confirmed cases.

32324985,A 2019. év végén, elsőként a kínai Vuhan városában megjelenő, SARS-CoV-2 béta-koronavírus okozta járványt 2020. március 11-én világjárvánnyá minősítette az Egészségügyi Világszervezet.
32324985,Magyarországon 2020. március 4-én jelentették az első megerősített COVID–19-esetet, s március 15-én vesztette életét az első, új típusú koronavírussal fertőzött beteg.
32324985,Az elhunyt halálának pillanatában nem állt rendelkezésre központi, egységes irányelv, mely tisztázta volna a szükséges óvintézkedések körét, illetve egyértelmű leírást nyújtott volna a tetem biztonságos kezeléséhez.
32324985,A halottak patológiai osztályra való szállítása, tárolása, esetleges boncolása, majd végső nyughelyre helyezése, ezek mikéntje számtalan kérdést vet fel.
32324985,A fertőző betegségekre, illetve a halottakkal kapcsolatos teendőkre vonatkozó hatályos jogszabályok nem tartalmaznak elégséges információt egy COVID–19-fertőzött beteg halála utáni feladatok végrehajtását illetően.
32324985,Az országos tisztifőorvos március 19-én felfüggesztette a boncolások elvégzését, a törvényszéki boncolások kivételével, azonban a szállítás, tárolás továbbra is problémát jelent.
32324985,Bár 2020. március 21-én az Emberi Erőforrások Minisztériuma Egészségügyi Szakmai Kollégiumának Patológia Tagozata kiadott egy hivatalos eljárásrendet, az ebben foglalt ajánlások a szakirodalom szűkebb spektrumát reprezentálják, több helyütt kiegészítésre szorulnak.
32324985,Sajnálatosan a nemzetközi szakirodalomban szintén – a fontosságához mérten – alulreprezentált a post mortem eljárásokra vonatkozó adat.
32324985,További problémát jelent, hogy a járványok okozta krízishelyzetek áldozatainak kezelésére írt cikkekben a fellelhető algoritmusok a magyarországitól eltérő jogi környezet mellett eltérő szervezeti és erőforrásbeli lehetőségekkel számolnak, mely körülmények a hazai adaptálást jelentősen nehezítik.
32324985,Cikkünkben a szakirodalmi összefoglaláson túl a COVID–19-gyanús, valószínűsített és megerősített páciensek kezelésében részt vevő egészségügyi dolgozók, valamint a potenciálisan érintett patológiai osztályok számára kivitelezhető, az ellátók biztonságát növelő javaslatokat, ajánlásokat fogalmazunk meg.

32325096,There may be a risk of COVID-19 transmission to rescuers delivering treatment for cardiac arrest.
32325096,The aim of this review was to identify the potential risk of transmission associated with key interventions (chest compressions, defibrillation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation) to inform international treatment recommendations.
32325096,We undertook a systematic review comprising three questions: (1) aerosol generation associated with key interventions; (2) risk of airborne infection transmission associated with key interventions; and (3) the effect of different personal protective equipment strategies.
32325096,We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the World Health Organization COVID-19 database on 24th March 2020.
32325096,Eligibility criteria were developed individually for each question.
32325096,We assessed risk of bias for individual studies, and used the GRADE process to assess evidence certainty by outcome.
32325096,We included eleven studies: two cohort studies, one case control study, five case reports, and three manikin randomised controlled trials.
32325096,We did not find any direct evidence that chest compressions or defibrillation either are or are not associated with aerosol generation or transmission of infection.
32325096,Data from manikin studies indicates that donning of personal protective equipment delays treatment delivery.
32325096,Studies provided only indirect evidence, with no study describing patients with COVID-19.
32325096,Evidence certainty was low or very low for all outcomes.
32325096,It is uncertain whether chest compressions or defibrillation cause aerosol generation or transmission of COVID-19 to rescuers.
32325096,There is very limited evidence and a rapid need for further studies.
32325096,Review registration: PROSPERO CRD42020175594.
32325124,This article examines three aspects of antivirals, such as hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, and remdesvir, as they might relate to the treatment of a viral infection such as COVID-19: (i) the use of vaporization for the delivery of antivirals, with the bulk constituents having mild antiviral efficacy; (ii) the application of a marine natural product extract as opposed to a single molecule as an antiviral agent; and (iii) a counter intuitive approach to formulation that is, in part, based on delivering multiple species that fall into three categories: building blocks for the virus to accelerate replication; an energy source for the infected cell to boost its immune response; and the species that antagonize or provide toxicity to the virus.
32325167,Hospital palliative care is an essential part of the COVID-19 response but data are lacking.
32325167,We identified symptom burden, management, response to treatment, and outcomes for a case series of 101 inpatients with confirmed COVID-19 referred to hospital palliative care.
32325167,Patients (64 men, median [interquartile range {IQR}] age 82 [72-89] years, Elixhauser Comorbidity Index 6 [2-10], Australian-modified Karnofsky Performance Status 20 [10-20]) were most frequently referred for end-of-life care or symptom control.
32325167,Median [IQR] days from hospital admission to referral was 4 [1-12] days.
32325167,Most prevalent symptoms (n) were breathlessness (67), agitation (43), drowsiness (36), pain (23), and delirium (24).
32325167,Fifty-eight patients were prescribed a subcutaneous infusion.
32325167,Frequently used medicines (median [range] dose/24 hours) were opioids (morphine, 10 [5-30] mg; fentanyl, 100 [100-200] mcg; alfentanil, 500 [150-1000] mcg) and midazolam (10 [5-20] mg).
32325167,Infusions were assessed as at least partially effective for 40/58 patients, while 13 patients died before review.
32325167,Patients spent a median [IQR] of 2 [1-4] days under the palliative care team, who made 3 [2-5] contacts across patient, family, and clinicians.
32325167,At March 30, 2020, 75 patients had died; 13 been discharged back to team, home, or hospice; and 13 continued to receive inpatient palliative care.
32325167,Palliative care is an essential component to the COVID-19 response, and teams must rapidly adapt with new ways of working.
32325167,Breathlessness and agitation are common but respond well to opioids and benzodiazepines.
32325167,Availability of subcutaneous infusion pumps is essential.
32325167,An international minimum data set for palliative care would accelerate finding answers to new questions as the COVID-19 pandemic develops.
32325252,In December 2019, a novel coronavirus, now named as SARS-CoV-2, caused a series of acute atypical respiratory diseases in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
32325252,The disease caused by this virus was termed COVID-19.
32325252,The virus is transmittable between humans and has caused pandemic worldwide.
32325252,The number of death tolls continues to rise and a large number of countries have been forced to do social distancing and lockdown.
32325252,Lack of targeted therapy continues to be a problem.
32325252,Epidemiological studies showed that elder patients were more susceptible to severe diseases, while children tend to have milder symptoms.
32325252,Here we reviewed the current knowledge about this disease and considered the potential explanation of the different symptomatology between children and adults.
32325474,The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic requires significant changes to standard operating procedures for non-COVID-19 related illnesses.
32325474,Balancing the benefit from standard evidence-based treatments with the risks posed by COVID-19 to patients, healthcare workers and to the population at large is difficult due to incomplete and rapidly changing information.
32325474,In this article, we use management of acute coronary syndromes as a case study to show how these competing risks and benefits can be resolved, albeit incompletely.
32325474,While the risks due to COVID-19 in patients with acute coronary syndromes is unclear, the benefits of standard management are well established in this condition.
32325474,As an aid to decision making, we recommend systematic estimation of the risks and benefits for management of any condition where there is likely to be an increase in non-COVID-19 related mortality and morbidity due to changes in routine care.
32325475,COVID-19 will be with us through the remainder of 2020 and almost certainly beyond.
32325475,New Zealand needs a viable strategy to protect its populace until a vaccine is developed and in wide use.
32325475,Until that time, it makes sense to protect the population by putting in place treatments that will be safe and effective, such as the use of convalescent sera and the use of direct-acting anti-virals.
32325475,These treatments should be sourced externally or made locally, but steps in this direction must now begin as the lockdown ends.
32325475,New Zealand has the scientists, the facilities and the will to make this happen, but the support of the government and the population will be needed if this plan is to succeed.
32325742,(1) Background: Viral respiratory infections cause life-threatening diseases in millions of people worldwide every year.
32325742,Human coronavirus and several picornaviruses are responsible for worldwide epidemic outbreaks, thus representing a heavy burden to their hosts.
32325742,In the absence of specific treatments for human viral infections, natural products offer an alternative in terms of innovative drug therapies.
32325742,(2) Methods: We analyzed the antiviral properties of the leaves and stem bark of the mulberry tree (<i>Morus</i> spp.).
32325742,We compared the antiviral activity of <i>Morus</i> spp. on enveloped and nonenveloped viral pathogens, such as human coronavirus (HCoV 229E) and different members of the <i>Picornaviridae</i> family-human poliovirus 1, human parechovirus 1 and 3, and human echovirus 11.
32325742,The antiviral activity of 12 water and water-alcohol plant extracts of the leaves and stem bark of three different species of mulberry-<i>Morus alba</i> var. <i>alba</i>, <i>Morus alba</i> var. <i>rosa</i>, and <i>Morus rubra</i>-were evaluated.
32325742,We also evaluated the antiviral activities of kuwanon G against HCoV-229E.
32325742,(3) Results: Our results showed that several extracts reduced the viral titer and cytopathogenic effects (CPE).
32325742,Leaves' water-alcohol extracts exhibited maximum antiviral activity on human coronavirus, while stem bark and leaves' water and water-alcohol extracts were the most effective on picornaviruses.
32325742,(4) Conclusions: The analysis of the antiviral activities of <i>Morus</i> spp. offer promising applications in antiviral strategies.
32325767,Since the infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was reported in China during December 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread on a global scale, causing the World Health Organization (WHO) to issue a warning.
32325767,While novel vaccines and drugs that target SARS-CoV-2 are under development, this review provides information on therapeutics which are under clinical trials or are proposed to antagonize SARS-CoV-2.
32325767,Based on the information gained from the responses to other RNA coronaviruses, including the strains that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronaviruses and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), drug repurposing might be a viable strategy.
32325767,Since several antiviral therapies can inhibit viral replication cycles or relieve symptoms, mechanisms unique to RNA viruses will be important for the clinical development of antivirals against SARS-CoV-2.
32325767,Given that several currently marketed drugs may be efficient therapeutic agents for severe COVID-19 cases, they may be beneficial for future viral pandemics and other infections caused by RNA viruses when standard treatments are unavailable.
32325888,An outbreak of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China has influenced every aspect of life.
32325888,Healthcare professionals, especially dentists, are exposed to a higher risk of getting infected due to close contact with infected patients.
32325888,The current study was conducted to assess anxiety and fear of getting infected among dentists while working during the current novel coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) outbreak.
32325888,In addition, dentists' knowledge about various practice modifications to combat COVID-19 has been evaluated.
32325888,A cross-sectional study was conducted using an online survey from 10th to 17th March 2020.
32325888,The well-constructed questionnaire was designed and registered at online website (Kwiksurveys) and validated.
32325888,A total of 669 participants from 30 different countries across the world responded.
32325888,After scrutiny, completed questionnaires (n = 650) were included in the study.
32325888,Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 25.
32325888,Chi-Square and Spearman correlation tests were applied to control confounders and assess the relation of dentists' response with respect to gender and educational level.
32325888,More than two-thirds of the general dental practitioners (78%) from 30 countries questioned were anxious and scared by the devastating effects of COVID-19.
32325888,A large number of dentists (90%) were aware of recent changes in the treatment protocols.
32325888,However, execution of amended treatment protocol was recorded as 61%.
32325888,The majority of the dentists (76%) were working in the hospital setting out of which 74% were from private, and 20% were from government setups.
32325888,Individually we received a large number of responses from Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, but collectively more than 50% of the responses were from other parts of the world.
32325888,Despite having a high standard of knowledge and practice, dental practitioners around the globe are in a state of anxiety and fear while working in their respective fields due to the COVID-19 pandemic impact on humanity.
32325888,A number of dental practices have either modified their services according to the recommended guidelines to emergency treatment only or closed down practices for an uncertain period.
32326343,Since 2004, we have been developing nanomaterials with antimicrobial properties, the so-called nanoantimicrobials.
32326343,When the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged, we started investigating new and challenging routes to nanoantivirals.
32326343,The two fields have some important points of contact.
32326343,We would like to share with the readership our vision of the role a (nano)materials scientist can play in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.
32326343,As researchers specifically working on surfaces and nanomaterials, in this letter we underline the importance of nanomaterial-based technological solutions in several aspects of the fight against the virus.
32326343,While great resources are understandably being dedicated to treatment and diagnosis, more efforts could be dedicated to limit the virus spread.
32326343,Increasing the efficacy of personal protection equipment, developing synergistic antiviral coatings, are only two of the cases discussed.
32326343,This is not the first nor the last pandemic: our nanomaterials community may offer several technological solutions to challenge the ongoing and future global health emergencies.
32326343,Readers' feedback and suggestions are warmly encouraged.
32326426,Considered to be a major portal of entry for infectious agents, the oral cavity is directly associated with the evolutionary process of SARS-CoV-2 in its inhalation of ambient particles in the air and in expectorations.
32326426,Some new generations of mouth rinses currently on the market have ingredients that could contribute to lower the SARS-CoV-2 viral load, and thus facilitate the fight against oral transmission.
32326426,If chlorhexidine, a usual component of mouth rinse, is not efficient to kill SARS-CoV-2, the use of a mouth rinses and/or with local nasal applications that contain β-cyclodextrins combined with flavonoids agents, such as Citrox, could provide valuable adjunctive treatment to reduce the viral load of saliva and nasopharyngeal microbiota, including potential SARS-CoV-2 carriage.
32326426,We urge national agencies and authorities to start clinical trials to evaluate the preventive effects of βCD-Citrox therapeutic oral biofilm rinses in reducing the viral load of the infection and possibly disease progression.
32326509,Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT) is suggested as an efficacious therapeutic strategy for restoring intestinal microbial balance, and thus for treating disease associated with alteration of gut microbiota.
32326509,FMT consists of the administration of fresh or frozen fecal microorganisms from a healthy donor into the intestinal tract of diseased patients.
32326509,At this time, in according to healthcare authorities, FMT is mainly used to treat recurrent <i>Clostridium difficile</i>.
32326509,Despite the existence of a few existing stool banks worldwide and many studies of the FMT, there is no standard method for producing material for FMT, and there are a multitude of factors that can vary between the institutions.
32326509,The main constraints for the therapeutic uses of FMT are safety concerns and acceptability.
32326509,Technical and logistical issues arise when establishing such a non-standardized treatment into clinical practice with safety and proper governance.
32326509,In this context, our manuscript describes a process of donor safety screening for FMT compiling clinical and biological examinations, questionnaires and interviews of donors.
32326509,The potential risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus by the use of fecal microbiota for transplantation must be taken urgently into consideration.
32326509,We discuss a standardized procedure of collection, preparation and cryopreservation of fecal samples through to the administration of material to patients, and explore the risks and limits of this method of FMT.
32326509,The future success of medicine employing microbiota transplantation will be tightly related to its modulation and manipulation to combat dysbiosis.
32326509,To achieve this goal, standard and strict methods need to be established before performing any type of FMT.
32326602,An outbreak of novel coronavirus-related pneumonia COVID-19, that was identified in December 2019, has expanded rapidly, with cases now confirmed in more than 211 countries or areas.
32326602,This constant transmission of a novel coronavirus and its ability to spread from human to human have prompted scientists to develop new approaches for treatment of COVID-19.
32326602,A recent study has shown that remdesivir and chloroquine effectively inhibit the replication and infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2, 2019-nCov) in vitro.
32326602,In the United States, one case of COVID-19 was successfully treated with compassionate use of remdesivir in January of 2020.
32326602,In addition, a clinically proven protease inhibitor, camostat mesylate, has been demonstrated to inhibit Calu-3 infection with SARS-CoV-2 and prevent SARS-2-spike protein (S protein)-mediated entry into primary human lung cells.
32326602,Here, we systemically discuss the pharmacological therapeutics targeting RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), proteinase and S protein for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32326602,This review should shed light on the fundamental rationale behind inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 enzymes RdRp as new therapeutic approaches for management of patients with COVID-19.
32326602,In addition, we will discuss the viability and challenges in targeting RdRp and proteinase, and application of natural product quinoline and its analog chloroquine for treatment of coronavirus infection.
32326602,Finally, determining the structural-functional relationships of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 will provide new insights into inhibition of interactions between S protein and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and enable us to develop novel therapeutic approaches for novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
32326671,The coronavirus outbreak was labeled a pandemic by the World Health Organization in 2020.
32326671,Patients who require spine surgery should receive coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) screening to prevent nosocomial cross-infection before surgery.
32326671,However, spine fracture and spinal injury are critical and serious, and there are no standard protocols for management.
32326671,This article aims to propose a treatment algorithm for the management of traumatic spine fracture during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32327245,The purpose of this study was to distinguish the imaging features of COVID-19 from those of other infectious pulmonary diseases and evaluate the diagnostic value of chest CT for suspected COVID-19 patients.
32327245,Adult patients suspected of COVID-19 aged &gt;18 years who underwent chest CT scans and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests within 14 days of symptom onset were enrolled.
32327245,The enrolled patients were confirmed and grouped according to the results of the RT-PCR tests.
32327245,The basic demographics, single chest CT features, and combined chest CT features were analyzed for the confirmed and nonconfirmed groups.
32327245,A total of 130 patients were enrolled, with 54 testing positive and 76 testing negative.
32327245,The typical CT imaging features of the positive group were ground glass opacities (GGOs), the crazy-paving pattern and air bronchogram.
32327245,The lesions were mostly distributed bilaterally and close to the lower lungs or the pleura.
32327245,When features were combined, GGOs with bilateral pulmonary distribution and GGOs with pleural distribution were more common among the positive patients, found in 31 (57.4%) and 30 patients (55.6%), respectively.
32327245,The combinations were almost all statistically significant (P &lt; .05), except for the combination of GGOs with consolidation.
32327245,Most combinations presented relatively low sensitivity but extremely high specificity.
32327245,The average specificity of these combinations was approximately 90%.
32327245,The combinations with GGOs could be useful in the identification and differential diagnosis of COVID-19, alerting clinicians to isolate patients for prompt treatment and repeat RT-PCR tests until the end of incubation.
32327293,The current outbreak of COVID-19 (coronavirus) has been identified by World Health Organization (WHO) as a global pandemic.
32327293,With the emergence of the COVID-19 virus and considering the lack of effective pharmaceutical treatment for it, there is an urgent need to identify safe and effective drugs or potential adjuvant therapy in this regard.
32327293,Bioactive lipids with an array of known health-promoting properties can be suggested as effective agents in alleviating acute respiratory stress induced by virus.
32327293,The bioactive lipid amide, oleoylethanolamide (OEA), due to several distinctive homeostatic properties, including anti-inflammatory activities, modulation of immune response, and anti-oxidant effects can be considered as a novel potential pharmacological alternative for the management of COVID-19.
32327383,Current events with the recent COVID-19 outbreak are necessitating steep learning curves for the NHS workforce.
32327383,Ultrasound, although not used in the diagnosis of COVID-19 may be utilised by practitioners at the point of care (POC) or on the intensive care units (ITUs) where rapid assessment of the lung condition may be required.
32327383,The aim of this article was to review current literature surrounding the use of lung ultrasound in relation to COVID-19 and provide Sonographers with a quick and digestible reference guide for lung pathologies.
32327383,Ultrasound is being used in Italy and China to help review lung condition during the COVID-19 outbreak however not strictly as a diagnostic tool as Computed Tomography (CT) of the chest and chest radiographs are currently gold standard.
32327383,Ultrasound is highly sensitive in the detection of multiple lung pathologies which can be demonstrated in conjunction with COVID-19 however to date there are no specific, nor pathognomonic findings which relate to COVID-19 on ultrasound.
32327383,Lung ultrasound is highly sensitive and can quickly and accurately review lung condition creating potential to assess for changes or resolution over time, especially in the ITU and POC setting.
32327383,However it should not be used as a diagnostic tool for COVID-19 due to low specificity in relation to the virus.
32327383,The adoption of lung ultrasound to monitor lung condition during the COVID-19 outbreak may reduce the need for serial exposure to ionising radiation on the wards and in turn reduce the number of radiographers required to attend infected wards and bays, protecting both patients and the workforce.
32327397,Combinations of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin have been promoted as treatments for COVID-19 based on small, uncontrolled clinical trials that have not assessed potential risks.
32327397,Risks of treatment include QT segment prolongation, Torsades de Pointes (TdP), and death.
32327397,This comparative pharmacovigilance analysis evaluated the risk of these events.
32327397,Data from the U.S.
32327397,Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) (&gt;13 million total reports) were used.
32327397,Queries extracted reports based on exposures of HCQ/chloroquine (CQ) alone, azithromycin alone, HCQ/CQ + azithromycin, amoxicillin alone, HCQ/CQ + amoxicillin alone.
32327397,Amoxicillin served as a control.
32327397,Events of interest included death and TdP/QT prolongation as well as accidents/injuries and depression as control events.
32327397,Proportional Reporting Ratios (PRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated where a lower limit of the of 95% CI (Lower95CI) value of ≥2.0 is interpreted as a potential safety signal.
32327397,Lower95CIs for HCQ/CQ alone showed no potential safety signals for TdP/QT prolongation, death, or any of the control events included.
32327397,The PRRs and 95% CIs for TdP/QT prolongation was 1.43 (1.29-2.59) with HCQ/CQ use alone and 4.10 (3.80-4.42) for azithromycin alone.
32327397,For the combined HCQ/CQ + azithromycin group, the PRR and 95% CI was 3.77 (1.80-7.87).
32327397,For the control of amoxicillin, there were no safety signals when used alone or in combination with HCQ/CQ.
32327397,HCQ/CQ use was not associated with a safety signal in this analysis of FAERS data.
32327397,However, azithromycin used alone was associated with TdP/QT prolongation events and should be used with caution.
32327490,To provide information on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people with epilepsy and provide consensus recommendations on how to provide the best possible care for people with epilepsy while avoiding visits to urgent care facilities and hospitalizations during the Novel Coronavirus pandemic.
32327490,The authors developed consensus statements in 2 sections.
32327490,The first was &quot;<i>How should we/clinicians modify our clinical care pathway for people with epilepsy during the COVID-19 pandemic?
32327490,&quot; The second was &quot;What general advice should we give to people with epilepsy during this crisis?
32327490,</i> Authors individually scored statements on a scale of -10 (strongly disagree) to +10 (strongly agree). 5/11 recommendations for physicians and 3/5 recommendations for individuals/families were rated by all authors as 7 or above (strongly agree) on the first round of rating.
32327490,Subsequently, a tele-conference was held where statements for which there was a lack of strong consensus were revised.
32327490,After revision, all consensus recommendations received a score of 7 or above.
32327490,The recommendations focus on administration of as much care as possible at home to keep people with epilepsy out of health care facilities, where they are likely to encounter COVID-19 (including strategies for rescue therapy), as well as minimization of risk of seizure exacerbation through adherence, and through ensuring a regular supply of medication.
32327490,We also provide helpful links to additional helpful information for people with epilepsy and health providers.
32327490,These recommendation may help healthcare professionals provide optimal care to people with epilepsy during the coronavirus pandemic.
32327746,In 1973, IL-6 was identified as a soluble factor that is secreted by T cells and is important for antibody production by B cells.
32327746,Since its discovery more than 40 years ago, the IL-6 pathway has emerged as a pivotal pathway involved in immune regulation in health and dysregulation in many diseases.
32327746,Targeting of the IL-6 pathway has led to innovative therapeutic approaches for various rheumatic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, adult-onset Still's disease, giant cell arteritis and Takayasu arteritis, as well as other conditions such as Castleman disease and cytokine release syndrome.
32327746,Targeting this pathway has also identified avenues for potential expansion into several other indications, such as uveitis, neuromyelitis optica and, most recently, COVID-19 pneumonia.
32327746,To mark the tenth anniversary of anti-IL-6 receptor therapy worldwide, we discuss the history of research into IL-6 biology and the development of therapies that target IL-6 signalling, including the successes and challenges and with an emphasis on rheumatic diseases.
32327870,The new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which gives rise to the highly contagious COVID-19 disease, has caused a pandemic that is overwhelming health care systems worldwide.
32327870,Affected patients have been reported to have a heightened inflammatory state that increases their thrombotic risk.
32327870,However, there is very scarce information on the management of thrombotic risk, coagulation disorders, and anticoagulant therapy.
32327870,In addition, the situation has also greatly influenced usual care in patients not infected with COVID-19.
32327870,This article by the Working Group on Cardiovascular Thrombosis of the Spanish Society of Cardiology aims to summarize the available information and to provide a practical approach to the management of antithrombotic therapy.
32327904,The current pandemic due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has caused an extreme burden for health care systems globally, and the number of cases is expected to continue to increase, at least in the immediate future.
32327904,The virus is estimated to have infected more than 1.5 million individuals.
32327904,The available reports suggest that gastrointestinal (GI) involvement in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is common and in some cases the GI symptoms may precede the respiratory symptoms.
32327904,In addition to direct effects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the infected patients remain at risk for the complications commonly managed by gastroenterology and hepatology consultants.
32327904,The most commonly reported GI manifestation of COVID-19 is diarrhea, which is reported in a third to up to more than half of the patients.
32327904,Mild to moderate elevation of the liver enzymes are also common, although no case of acute liver failure has been reported so far.
32327904,Many of the medications used for treatment of COVID-19 can also be associated with GI symptoms or liver injury and can be included in the differential diagnosis in these patients.
32327904,Although the diagnosis of the infection is currently based on RNA analysis in respiratory samples, the available literature on fecal shedding of this virus suggests that fecal RNA testing might prove to be a useful diagnostic test.
32327904,It is reasonable to delay all non-urgent endoscopic procedures during the peak of the pandemic and use additional protective equipment such as N95 respirators during endoscopy while most patients can be considered high risk for having been exposed to the virus.
32328206,The Covid-19 pandemic is profoundly changing the organization of healthcare access.
32328206,This is particularly so for peritoneal neoplastic diseases, for which curative treatment mobilizes substantial personnel, operating room and intensive care resources.
32328206,The BIG-RENAPE and RENAPE groups have made tentative proposals for prioritizing care provision.A tightening of the usual selection criteria is needed for curative care: young patients with few or no comorbidities and limited peritoneal extension.
32328206,It is desirable to prioritize disease conditions for which cytoreduction surgery with or without associated hyperthermic intraoperative peritoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) is the gold-standard treatment, and for which systemic chemotherapy cannot be a temporary or long-term alternative: pseudomyxoma peritonei, resectable malignant peritoneal mesotheliomas, peritoneal metastases of colorectal origin if they are resectable and unresponsive to systemic chemotherapy after up to 12 courses, first-line ovarian carcinomatosis if resectable or in interval surgery after at most six courses of systemic chemotherapy.
32328206,Addition of HIPEC must be discussed case by case in an expert center.
32328206,The prioritization of indications must consider local conditions and the phase of the epidemic to allow optimal peri-operative care.
32328367,Coronavirus (COVID-19) is an enveloped RNA virus that is diversely found in humans and wildlife.
32328367,A total of six species have been identified to cause disease in humans.
32328367,They are known to infect the neurological, respiratory, enteric, and hepatic systems.
32328367,The past few decades have seen endemic outbreaks in the form of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome related coronavirus (SARS-CoV).
32328367,Yet again, we see the emergence of another outbreak due to a new strain called the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
32328367,The most recent outbreak initially presented as pneumonia of unknown etiology in a cluster of patients in Wuhan, China.
32328367,The epicenter of infection was linked to seafood and exotic animal wholesale markets in the city.
32328367,SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and has resulted in a rapid pandemic of COVID-19.
32328367,As the number of cases continues to rise, it is clear that these viruses pose a threat to public health.
32328367,This review will introduce a general overview of coronavirus and describe the clinical features, evaluation, and treatment of COVID-19 patients.
32328367,It will also provide a means to raise awareness among primary and secondary healthcare providers during the current pandemic.
32328367,Furthermore, our review focuses on the most up-to-date clinical information for the effective management, prevention, and counseling of patients worldwide.
32328369,The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has impacted many countries across all inhabited continents, and is now considered a global pandemic, due to its high rate of infectivity.
32328369,Research related to this disease is pivotal for assessing pathogenic characteristics and formulating therapeutic strategies.
32328369,The aim of this paper is to explore the activity and trends of COVID-19 research since its outbreak in December 2019.
32328369,We explored the PubMed database and the World Health Organization (WHO) database for publications pertaining to COVID-19 since December 2019 up until March 18, 2020.
32328369,Only relevant observational and interventional studies were included in our study.
32328369,Data on COVID-19 incidence were extracted from the WHO situation reports.
32328369,Research output was assessed with respect to gross domestic product (GDP) and population of each country.
32328369,Only 564 publications met our inclusion criteria.
32328369,These articles came from 39 different countries, constituting 24% of all affected countries.
32328369,China produced the greatest number of publications with 377 publications (67%).
32328369,With respect to continental research activity, Asian countries had the highest research activity with 434 original publications (77%).
32328369,In terms of publications per million persons (PPMPs), Singapore had the highest number of publications with 1.069 PPMPs.
32328369,In terms of publications per billion-dollar GDP, Mauritius ranked first with 0.075.
32328369,COVID-19 is a major disease that has impacted international public health on a global level.
32328369,Observational studies and therapeutic trials pertaining to COVID-19 are essential for assessing pathogenic characteristics and developing novel treatment options.
32328595,This paper is aimed at addressing the urgent need to develop a protocol that will address the operatory and clinical aspects of dental care during the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak.
32328595,The epidemiology, clinical signs and symptoms, and modes of transmission of COVID-19 are presented.
32328595,This protocol was established as an international collaboration of three dental universities: Hadassah School of Dental Medicine, Israel; University of Rochester Medical Center, USA; and the University of Pennsylvania, USA.
32328595,This protocol is based on a detailed review of the existing English language literature as well on the logistic and clinical experience of each facility and the opinion of the authors.
32328595,The protocol is designed for a hospital setting and includes considerations related to dental treatment in both healthy subjects and those suspected or diagnosed with COVID-19.
32328595,The first part of this review discusses operatory considerations; the second part discusses general dental clinical aspects; the third part discusses endodontic considerations; and the fourth part discusses surgical aspects.
32328595,This protocol may be applicable to other future similar pandemics.
32328595,Logistic and clinical steps are required to provide dental care during the COVID-19 outbreak while preventing cross-contamination and protecting the dental team during the provision of care.
32328757,There is an urgent need to address how to best provide ophthalmic care for patients with retinal disease receiving intravitreal injections with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents during the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic.
32328757,This article provides guidance for ophthalmologists on how to deliver the best possible care for patients while minimizing the risk of infection.
32328757,The Vision Academy's Steering Committee of international retinal disease experts convened to discuss key considerations for managing patients with retinal disease during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32328757,After reviewing the existing literature on the issue, members put forward recommendations that were systematically refined and voted on to develop this guidance.
32328757,The considerations focus on the implementation of steps to minimize the exposure of patients and healthcare staff to COVID-19.
32328757,These include the use of personal protective equipment, adherence to scrupulous hygiene and disinfection protocols, pre-screening to identify symptomatic patients, and reducing the number of people in waiting rooms.
32328757,Other important measures include triaging of patients to identify those at the greatest risk of irreversible vision loss and prioritization of treatment visits over monitoring visits where possible.
32328757,In order to limit patient exposure, ophthalmologists should refrain from using treatment regimens that require frequent monitoring.
32328757,Management of patients with retinal disease receiving intravitreal injections during the COVID-19 pandemic will require adjustment to regular clinical practice to minimize the risk of exposure of patients and healthcare staff, and to prioritize those with the greatest medical need.
32328757,The safety of patients and healthcare staff should be of paramount importance in all decision-making.
32328850,To analyze the susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy and the drugs that can be used to treat pregnancy with COVID-19, so as to provide evidence for drug selection in clinic.
32328850,By reviewing the existing literature, this paper analyzes the susceptibility of pregnant women to virus, especially to SARS-CoV-2, from the aspects of anatomical, reproductive endocrine and immune changes during pregnancy and screens effective and fetal-safe treatments from the existing drugs.
32328850,The anatomical structure of the respiratory system is changed during pregnancy, and the virus transmitted by droplets and aerosols is more easily inhaled by pregnant women and is difficult to remove.
32328850,Furthermore, the prognosis is worse after infection when compared with non-pregnancy women.
32328850,And changes in reproductive hormones and immune systems during pregnancy collectively make them more susceptible to certain infections.
32328850,More importantly, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-2, the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, has been proven highly increased during pregnancy, which may contribute to the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2.
32328850,When it comes to treatment, specific drugs for COVID-19 have not been found at present, and taking old drugs for new use in treating COVID-19 has become an emergency method for the pandemic.
32328850,Particularly, drugs that show superior maternal and fetal safety are worthy of consideration for pregnant women with COVID-19, such as chloroquine, metformin, statins, lobinavir/ritonavir, glycyrrhizic acid, and nanoparticle-mediated drug delivery (NMDD), etc.
32328850,Pregnant women are susceptible to COVID-19, and special attention should be paid to the selection of drugs that are both effective for maternal diseases and friendly to the fetus.
32328850,However, there are still many deficiencies in the study of drug safety during pregnancy, and broad-spectrum, effective and fetal-safe drugs for pregnant women need to be developed so as to cope with more infectious diseases in the future.
32329046,The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is forcing neurologists to carry out a series of adaptations in the management of multiple sclerosis.
32329046,Neurologists must weigh up the need to start or continue disease-modifying treatments against the risk of infection, the risk of complications from the infection, and the risk of multiple sclerosis activity.
32329046,Since this is an unprecedented situation, most decisions are being made on the basis of a theoretical approach and the criteria of each neurologist.
32329046,The aim of this study is conduct a literature search to collect available evidence on the relationship between disease-modifying therapies in multiple sclerosis and SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32329046,This evidence, together with the experience of the authors in the management of patients with multiple sclerosis during the pandemic, will make it possible to offer some proposals for the treatment and follow-up of patients in this epidemiological context.
32329046,After the literature search and our experience in the management of patients, a number of proposals for treatment are established for each drug, which must necessarily be individualised for each patient, since, in these exceptional circumstances, their peculiarities can affect the prognosis.
32329046,The neurologist should be aware of current evidence to assess the risk-benefit of starting, maintaining and stopping disease-modifying therapies in multiple sclerosis during the pandemic.
32329046,Documento EMCAM (Esclerosis Múltiple Comunidad Autónoma de Madrid) para el manejo de pacientes con esclerosis múltiple durante la pandemia de SARS-CoV-2.
32329046,Introducción.
32329046,La pandemia actual por el SARS-CoV-2 está obligando a los neurólogos a una serie de adaptaciones en el manejo de la esclerosis múltiple.
32329046,Los neurólogos deben sopesar la necesidad de iniciar o continuar los tratamientos modificadores de la enfermedad en función del riesgo de infección, del riesgo de complicaciones de la infección y del riesgo de actividad de la esclerosis múltiple.
32329046,Dado que ésta es una situación sin precedentes, la mayoría de las decisiones se están tomando sobre la base de un abordaje teórico y del criterio de cada neurólogo.
32329046,Objetivos.
32329046,Se pretende, a través de una búsqueda bibliográfica, recopilar la evidencia disponible sobre la relación entre tratamientos modificadores de la enfermedad en la esclerosis múltiple y la infección por el SARS-CoV-2.
32329046,Esta evidencia, junto con la experiencia de los autores en el manejo de pacientes con esclerosis múltiple durante la pandemia, permitirá brindar algunas propuestas de tratamiento y seguimiento de los pacientes en este contexto epidemiológico.
32329046,Desarrollo.
32329046,Después de la búsqueda bibliográfica y de nuestra experiencia en el manejo de pacientes, se establecen unas propuestas de tratamiento sobre cada fármaco que necesariamente han de individualizarse para cada paciente, ya que, en esta circunstancia excepcional, sus peculiaridades pueden marcar el pronóstico.
32329046,Conclusiones.
32329046,El neurólogo debe tener conocimiento de la evidencia actual para valorar el riesgo-beneficio de iniciar, mantener y suspender los tratamientos modificadores de la enfermedad en la esclerosis múltiple durante la pandemia.
32329231,Antiviral drugs are administered in patients with severe COVID-19 respiratory syndrome, including those treated with direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs).
32329231,Concomitant administration of antiviral agents has the potential to increase their plasma concentration.
32329231,A series of patients managed in the Cremona Thrombosis Center were admitted at Cremona Hospital for SARS-CoV-2 and started antiviral drugs without stopping DOAC therapy.
32329231,DOAC plasma levels were measured in hospital and results compared with those recorded before hospitalization.
32329231,All consecutive patients on DOACs were candidates for administration of antiviral agents (lopinavir, ritonavir, or darunavir).
32329231,Plasma samples for DOAC measurement were collected 2to 4 days after starting antiviral treatment, at 12 hours from the last dose intake in patients on dabigatran and apixaban, and at 24 hours in those on rivaroxaban and edoxaban.
32329231,For each patient, C-trough DOAC level, expressed as ng/mL, was compared with the one measured before hospitalization.
32329231,Of the 1039 patients hospitalized between February 22 and March 15, 2020 with COVID-19 pneumonia and candidates for antiviral therapy, 32 were on treatment with a DOAC.
32329231,DOAC was stopped in 20 and continued in the remaining 12.
32329231,On average, C-trough levels were 6.14 times higher during hospitalization than in the pre-hospitalization period.
32329231,DOAC patients treated with antiviral drugs show an alarming increase in DOAC plasma levels.
32329231,In order to prevent bleeding complications, we believe that physicians should consider withholding DOACs from patients with SARS-CoV-2 and replacing them with alternative parenteral antithrombotic strategies for as long as antiviral agents are deemed necessary and until discharge.
32329246,The global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which requires ventilation in critically ill patients.
32329246,The pathophysiology of ARDS results from acute inflammation within the alveolar space and prevention of normal gas exchange.
32329246,The increase in proinflammatory cytokines within the lung leads to recruitment of leukocytes, further propagating the local inflammatory response.
32329246,A consistent finding in ARDS is the deposition of fibrin in the air spaces and lung parenchyma.
32329246,COVID-19 patients show elevated D-Dimers and fibrinogen.
32329246,Fibrin deposits are found in the lungs of patients due to the dysregulation of the coagulation and fibrinolytic systems.
32329246,Tissue factor (TF) is exposed on damaged alveolar endothelial cells and on the surface of leukocytes promoting fibrin deposition, while significantly elevated levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) from lung epithelium and endothelial cells create a hypofibrinolytic state.
32329246,Prophylaxis treatment of COVID-19 patients with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is important to limit coagulopathy.
32329246,However, to degrade pre-existing fibrin in the lung it is essential to promote local fibrinolysis.
32329246,In this review, we discuss the repurposing of fibrinolytic drugs, namely tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), to treat COVID-19 associated ARDS. tPA is an approved intravenous thrombolytic treatment, and the nebulizer form has been shown to be effective in plastic bronchitis and is currently in Phase II clinical trial.
32329246,Nebulizer plasminogen activators may provide a targeted approach in COVID-19 patients to degrade fibrin and improving oxygenation in critically ill patients.

32329275,All articles were categorized into epidemiology, clinical diagnosis and treatment, basic research, pregnant women and children, mental health, epidemic prevention &amp; control, and others.
32329275,The literatures related to SARS-CoV-2 are emerging rapidly.
32329275,It is necessary to sort out and summarize the research topic in time, which has a good reference value for staff in different positions.
32329275,At the same time, it is necessary to strengthen the judgment of the quality of literatures.

32329276,Recently a COVID-19 pneumonia pandemic caused by a novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV has broken out over the world.
32329276,In order to better control the spread of the pandemic, there's an urgent need to extensively study the virus' origin and the mechanisms for its infectivity and pathogenicity.
32329276,Spike protein is a special structural protein on the surface of coronavirus.
32329276,It contains important information about the evolution of the virus and plays critical roles in the processes of cellular recognition and entry.
32329276,In the past decades, spike protein has always been one of the most important objects in research works on coronaviruses closely related to human life.
32329276,In this review we introduce these research works related to spike proteins, hoping it will provide reasonable ideas for the control of the current pandemic, as well as for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.
32329276,最近，一种由新型冠状病毒 2019-nCoV 引起的 COVID-19 肺炎疫情在全球暴发。
32329276,为了更好地控制疫情的蔓延，亟需对 2019-nCoV 的来源、传播和致病机制进行深入研究。
32329276,刺突（spike）蛋白是冠状病毒表面特有的结构蛋白，包含了冠状病毒自然演化的重要信息，并在病毒识别和入侵人体细胞的过程中起到关键作用。
32329276,最近十几年，在对与人类密切相关的冠状病毒的研究中，spike 蛋白一直是最为重要的研究对象之一。
32329276,而在 COVID-19 肺炎疫情暴发后，2019-nCoV 病毒表面的 spike 蛋白也迅速成为研究的焦点。
32329276,本文旨在通过介绍 spike 蛋白相关研究，以期为当前疫情的防控以及 COVID-19 的诊断和治疗提供合理的研究思路。.
32329404,Early reports of potential treatment for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have raised concerns related to pharmaceutical distribution.
32329404,Despite the lack of high-quality evidence, the mere hope of effectiveness of potential treatments, such as hydroxychloroquine, has led to surges in demand for these products, and many pharmacists are already informally reporting shortages through social channels.
32329404,As manufacturers and wholesale distributors struggle to fulfill orders for drugs such as hydroxychloroquine, short-term price increases may seem reasonable in a free market when demand increases.
32329404,However, any price increases by manufacturers, wholesale distributors, and pharmacies might be seen as exploitive gouging of consumers during a declared emergency.
32329404,In addition to concerns of price gouging, increases in prescription drug utilization during the pandemic may lead to increases in spending for all payers as members may be treated for COVID-19.
32329404,This article explores pharmaceutical supply chain and drug pricing nuances that may cause problems for payers and pharmacies as the country battles this global pandemic.

32329419,SARS-CoV-2 virus which caused the global pandemic the Coronavirus Disease- 2019 (COVID-2019) has infected about 1,203,959 patients and brought forth death rate about 64,788 among 206 countries as mentioned by WHO in the month of April 2020.
32329419,The clinical trials are underway for Remdesivir, an investigational anti-viral drug from Gilead Sciences.
32329419,Antimalarial drugs such as Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine derivatives are being used in emergency cases; however, they are not suitable for patients with conditions like diabetes, hypertension and cardiac issues.
32329419,The lack of availability of approved treatment for this disease calls forth the scientific community to find novel compounds with the ability to treat it.
32329419,This paper evaluates the compound Andrographolide from <i>Andrographis paniculata</i> as a potential inhibitor of the main protease of SARS-COV-2 (Mpro) through <i>in silico</i> studies such as molecular docking, target analysis, toxicity prediction and ADME prediction.
32329419,Andrographolide was docked successfully in the binding site of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.
32329419,Computational approaches also predicts this molecule to have good solubility, pharmacodynamics property and target accuracy.
32329419,This molecule also obeys Lipinski's rule, which makes it a promising compound to pursue further biochemical and cell based assays to explore its potential for use against COVID-19.

32329520,Since December 2019 SARS-Cov-2 was found responsible for the disease COVID-19, which has spread worldwide.
32329520,No specific therapies/vaccines are yet available for the treatment of COVID-19.
32329520,Drug repositioning may offer a strategy and a number of drugs have been repurposed, including lopinavir/ritonavir, remdesivir, favipiravir and tocilizumab.
32329520,This paper describes the main pharmacological properties of such drugs administered to patients with COVID-19, focusing on their antiviral, immune-modulatory and/or anti-inflammatory actions.
32329520,Where available, data from clinical trials involving patients with COVID-19 are reported.
32329520,Preliminary clinical trials seem to support their benefit.
32329520,However, such drugs in COVID-19 patients have peculiar safety profiles.
32329520,Thus, adequate clinical trials are necessary for these compounds.
32329520,Nevertheless, while waiting for effective preventive measures i.e. vaccines, many clinical trials on drugs belonging to different therapeutic classes are currently underway.
32329520,Their results will help us in defining the best way to treat COVID-19 and reducing its symptoms and complications.
32329563,At present, there is scarce information regarding the global prevalence of chronic liver disease in individuals with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease, which is becoming a global pandemic.
32329563,The aim of this study was to assess the overall prevalence of chronic liver disease among patients with COVID-19 disease by meta-analysing data in observational studies and to investigate the relationship between liver damage and COVID-19 disease.
32329563,We included 11 observational studies for a total of 2034 adult individuals (median age 49 years [IQR 45-54], 57.2% men).
32329563,The overall prevalence of chronic liver disease at baseline was 3% (95% CI 2%-4%; I<sup>2</sup>  = 29.1%).
32329563,Individuals with severe COVID-19 disease had relevant alterations of liver enzymes and coagulative profile, probably due to the innate immune response against the virus.
32329563,Further studies are needed to better investigate the causes of liver injury in patients with COVID-19 disease and the effect of treatment for COVID-19 on the liver.
32329659,Concerns about the prevention and management of COVID-19 are on the rise, as it is crucial in contagious epidemics that travel and transfer of the patients be minimal for diagnosis, treatment, and follow-ups.
32329659,Telemedicine or telehealth can play an important role, especially with previous successful experiences in the management of acute infectious respiratory epidemics such as SARS and MERS.
32329659,In order to better control the rapid spread of coronavirus and manage the COVID-19 crisis, both developed and developing countries can improve the efficiency of their health system by replacing a proportion of face-to-face clinical encounters with telehealth.
32329659,Recent technological advancement facilitates this reform, but there is a need for national or state-wide rules and regulations to be adapted accordingly.
32329877,SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the outbreak of severe respiratory illness (COVID-19) in Wuhan City, China and is now spreading rapidly throughout the world.
32329877,The prompt outbreak of COVID-19 and its quick spread without any controllable measure defines the severity of the situation.
32329877,In this crisis, a collective pool of knowledge about the advancement of clinical diagnostic and management for COVID-19 is a prerequisite.
32329877,Here, we summarize all the available updates on the multidisciplinary approaches for the advancement of diagnosis and proposed therapeutic strategies for COVID-19.
32329877,Moreover, the review discusses different aspects of the COVID-19, including its epidemiology; incubation period; the general clinical features of patients; the clinical features of intensive care unit (ICU) patients; SARS-CoV-2 infection in the presence of co-morbid diseases and the clinical features of pediatric patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2.
32329877,Advances in various diagnostic approaches, such as the use of real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), chest radiography, and computed tomography (CT) imaging; and other modern diagnostic methods, for this infection have been highlighted.
32329877,However, due to the unavailability of adequate evidence, presently there are no officially approved drugs or vaccines available against SARS-CoV-2.
32329877,Additionally, we have discussed various therapeutic strategies for COVID-19 under different categories, like the possible treatment plans with drug (antiviral drugs and anti-cytokines) therapy for disease prevention.
32329877,Lastly, potentials candidates for the vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 infection have been described.
32329877,Collectively, the review provides an overview of the SARS-CoV-2 infection outbreak along with the recent advancements and strategies for diagnosis and therapy of COVID-19.
32329879,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new strain that was discovered in 2019 and has not been previously identified in humans.
32329879,On December 31st 2019 World Health Organization (WHO) was informed of a cluster of cases with pneumonia of unknown origin from Wuhan City, Hubei province of China.
32329879,The WHO announced in February 2020 that COVID-19 is the official name of the coronavirus diseases.
32329879,A total of 519,899 confirmed cases with 23,592 deaths linked to this pathogen as on March 27, 2020 have been reported.
32329879,Due to increasing number of infected people across the continents and huge loss to human life, the WHO has declared the novel COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic.
32329879,A pandemic is defined as the &quot;worldwide spread&quot; of a new disease.
32329879,Currently, no COVID-19 specific treatments have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US-FDA).
32329879,However, the current treatment options include hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab, remdesivir, lopinavir-ritonavir (Kaletra®), and nitazoxanide.
32329879,In recent past, some natural herbal compounds have demonstrated encouraging anti-viral properties.
32329879,This article attempted to summarize available information on the reported anti-viral activity of some natural products.
32329881,SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2)-related pneumonia, referred to as COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 19), is a public health emergency as it carries high morbidity, mortality, and has no approved specific pharmacological treatments.
32329881,In this case series, we aimed to report preliminary data obtained with anti-complement C5 therapy with eculizumab in COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) of ASL Napoli 2 Nord.
32329881,This is a case series of patients with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV2 infection and severe pneumonia or ARDS who were treated with up to 4 infusions of eculizumab as an off-label agent.
32329881,Patients were also treated with anticoagulant therapy with Enoxaparin 4000 IU/day via subcutaneous injection, antiviral therapy with Lopinavir 800 mg/day + Ritonavir 200 mg/day, hydroxychloroquine 400 mg/day, ceftriaxone 2 g/day IV, vitamine C 6 g/day for 4 days, and were on Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV).
32329881,We treated four COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit because of severe pneumonia or ARDS.
32329881,All patients successfully recovered after treatment with eculizumab.
32329881,Eculizumab induced a drop in inflammatory markers.
32329881,Mean C Reactive Protein levels dropped from 14.6 mg/dl to 3.5 mg/dl and the mean duration of the disease was 12.8 days.
32329881,Eculizumab has the potential to be a key player in treatment of severe cases of COVID-19.
32329881,Our results support eculizumab use as an off-label treatment of COVID-19, pending confirmation from the ongoing SOLID-C19 trial.
32329920,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in the reorganization of health-care settings affecting clinical care delivery to patients with Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy (DBMD) as well as other inherited muscular dystrophies.
32329920,The magnitude of the impact of this public health emergency on the care of patients with DBMD is unclear as they are suspected of having an increased risk for severe manifestations of COVID-19.
32329920,In this article, the authors discuss their consensus recommendations pertaining to care of these patients during the pandemic.
32329920,We address issues surrounding corticosteroid and exon-skipping treatments, cardiac medications, hydroxychloroquine use, emergency/respiratory care, rehabilitation management, and the conduct of clinical trials.
32329920,We highlight the importance of collaborative treatment decisions between the patient, family, and health-care provider, considering any geographic or institution-specific policies and precautions for COVID-19.
32329920,We advocate for continuing multidisciplinary care for these patients using telehealth.
32329921,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in reorganization of healthcare settings affecting the delivery of clinical care to patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).
32329921,There is a concern that patients with SMA may be at increased risk of manifesting severe symptoms of COVID-19.
32329921,Currently approved therapies for SMA improve survival and motor function; however, their delivery requires an increased exposure to the health system and a dedicated healthcare team.
32329921,In this study, we discuss consensus recommendations pertaining to care of SMA patients during the pandemic.
32329921,We highlight that SMA treatments should not be perceived as elective.
32329921,Decisions regarding the delay of treatments should be made with consideration of the potential risks of COVID-19 exposure and the risk of that delay.
32329921,We emphasize the importance of collaborative treatment decisions between the patient, family, and healthcare provider, considering any geographic- or institution-specific policies and precautions for COVID-19.
32329924,In the context of COVID-19, cancer survivors represent a particularly vulnerable population that may be &quot;doubly hit&quot; by both costs of cancer treatment and financial strain imposed by the pandemic.
32329924,We performed a review of the literature pertaining to cancer, financial toxicity, and economic challenges.
32329924,Multiple societies have put forth recommendations to modify delivery of cancer care in order to minimize patient exposure to the virus.
32329924,Cancer survivors, especially patients with head and neck cancer, have been disproportionately affected by rising unemployment levels and economic recessions in the past, both of which are linked to higher cancer mortality.
32329924,Patients who rely on employer-provided insurance and do not qualify for Medicaid may lose access to life-saving treatments.
32329924,It is essential to implement interventions and policy changes in order to mitigate the effects of this pandemic but also to ensure this becomes a nonissue during the next one.
32329930,The current COVID-19 pandemic influences many areas of social life, medical treatments and the way allergy is performed.
32329930,Allergen-specific immunotherapy (AIT) is one of the most important treatment options for IgE-mediated allergies and is based on immunological effects on the diseased patient.
32329953,The coronavirus infection is rapidly spreading, putting a strain on health care services across the globe.
32329953,Patients with oral cancer are susceptible often immunosuppressed due to the disease and/or the treatment received.
32329953,We performed a simulation of the currently available data using a multistate and hazards model to provide an objective model for counseling and decision making for health care workers.
32329953,Stage IV patients with oral cancer who did not receive treatment had progression of disease and an increased mortality rate compared to patients who receive treatment but did not contract COVID-19.
32329953,The patients who received treatment and got affected with COVID-19 had a far worse impact and higher mortality rate than all other groups.
32329953,Isolation and deferring treatment for stage IV patients with oral cancer, so as to avoid hospital visits and contraction of COVID-19, is an advisable strategy based on this model.
32329958,Multidisciplinary conferences (MDC) are an important component of head and neck oncologic care including diagnosis, treatment, and survivorship.
32329958,Virtual MDC allows for improved collaboration between providers at distant sites and proper allocation of health care resources in a time of crisis.
32329958,When approached systematically, a virtual MDC is feasible to design and implement in a large academic medical center with multiple satellite hospitals.
32330073,Amid efforts to care for the large number of patients with COVID-19, there has been considerable speculation about whether the lung injury seen in these patients is different than ARDS from other causes.
32330073,One idea that has garnered considerable attention, particularly on social media and in free open access medicine is the notion that lung injury due to COVID-19 is more similar to high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE).
32330073,Drawing on this concept, it has also been proposed that treatments typically employed in the management of HAPE and other forms of acute altitude illness, pulmonary vasodilators and acetazolamide, should be considered for COVID-19.
32330073,Despite some similarities in clinical features between the two entities, such as hypoxemia, radiographic opacities and altered lung compliance, the pathophysiological mechanisms of HAPE and lung injury due to COVID-19 are fundamentally different and the entities cannot be viewed as equivalent.
32330073,While of high utility in the management of HAPE and acute mountain sickness, systemically delivered pulmonary vasodilators and acetazolamide should not be used in the treatment of COVID-19, as they carry the risk of multiple adverse consequences including worsened ventilation-perfusion matching, impaired carbon dioxide transport, systemic hypotension and increased work of breathing.
32330124,With the current rapid spread of COVID-19, global health systems are increasingly overburdened by the sheer number of people that need diagnosis, isolation and treatment.
32330124,Shortcomings are evident across the board, from staffing, facilities for rapid and reliable testing to availability of hospital beds and key medical-grade equipment.
32330124,The scale and breadth of the problem calls for an equally substantive response not only from frontline workers such as medical staff and scientists, but from skilled members of the public who have the time, facilities and knowledge to meaningfully contribute to a consolidated global response.
32330124,Here, we summarise community-driven approaches based on Free and Open Source scientific and medical Hardware (FOSH) as well as personal protective equipment (PPE) currently being developed and deployed to support the global response for COVID-19 prevention, patient treatment and diagnostics.
32330208,The 2019 novel coronavirus (renamed SARS-CoV-2, and generally referred to as the COVID-19 virus) has spread to 184 countries with over 1.5 million confirmed cases.
32330208,Such major viral outbreaks demand early elucidation of taxonomic classification and origin of the virus genomic sequence, for strategic planning, containment, and treatment.
32330208,This paper identifies an intrinsic COVID-19 virus genomic signature and uses it together with a machine learning-based alignment-free approach for an ultra-fast, scalable, and highly accurate classification of whole COVID-19 virus genomes.
32330208,The proposed method combines supervised machine learning with digital signal processing (MLDSP) for genome analyses, augmented by a decision tree approach to the machine learning component, and a Spearman's rank correlation coefficient analysis for result validation.
32330208,These tools are used to analyze a large dataset of over 5000 unique viral genomic sequences, totalling 61.8 million bp, including the 29 COVID-19 virus sequences available on January 27, 2020.
32330208,Our results support a hypothesis of a bat origin and classify the COVID-19 virus as Sarbecovirus, within Betacoronavirus.
32330208,Our method achieves 100% accurate classification of the COVID-19 virus sequences, and discovers the most relevant relationships among over 5000 viral genomes within a few minutes, ab initio, using raw DNA sequence data alone, and without any specialized biological knowledge, training, gene or genome annotations.
32330208,This suggests that, for novel viral and pathogen genome sequences, this alignment-free whole-genome machine-learning approach can provide a reliable real-time option for taxonomic classification.
32330277,There is no specific antiviral therapy recommended for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32330277,In vitro studies indicate that the antiviral effect of chloroquine diphosphate (CQ) requires a high concentration of the drug.
32330277,To evaluate the safety and efficacy of 2 CQ dosages in patients with severe COVID-19.
32330277,This parallel, double-masked, randomized, phase IIb clinical trial with 81 adult patients who were hospitalized with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was conducted from March 23 to April 5, 2020, at a tertiary care facility in Manaus, Brazilian Amazon.
32330277,Patients were allocated to receive high-dosage CQ (ie, 600 mg CQ twice daily for 10 days) or low-dosage CQ (ie, 450 mg twice daily on day 1 and once daily for 4 days).
32330277,Primary outcome was reduction in lethality by at least 50% in the high-dosage group compared with the low-dosage group.
32330277,Data presented here refer primarily to safety and lethality outcomes during treatment on day 13.
32330277,Secondary end points included participant clinical status, laboratory examinations, and electrocardiogram results.
32330277,Outcomes will be presented to day 28.
32330277,Viral respiratory secretion RNA detection was performed on days 0 and 4.
32330277,Out of a predefined sample size of 440 patients, 81 were enrolled (41 [50.6%] to high-dosage group and 40 [49.4%] to low-dosage group).
32330277,Enrolled patients had a mean (SD) age of 51.1 (13.9) years, and most (60 [75.3%]) were men.
32330277,Older age (mean [SD] age, 54.7 [13.7] years vs 47.4 [13.3] years) and more heart disease (5 of 28 [17.9%] vs 0) were seen in the high-dose group.
32330277,Viral RNA was detected in 31 of 40 (77.5%) and 31 of 41 (75.6%) patients in the low-dosage and high-dosage groups, respectively.
32330277,Lethality until day 13 was 39.0% in the high-dosage group (16 of 41) and 15.0% in the low-dosage group (6 of 40).
32330277,The high-dosage group presented more instance of QTc interval greater than 500 milliseconds (7 of 37 [18.9%]) compared with the low-dosage group (4 of 36 [11.1%]).
32330277,Respiratory secretion at day 4 was negative in only 6 of 27 patients (22.2%).
32330277,The preliminary findings of this study suggest that the higher CQ dosage should not be recommended for critically ill patients with COVID-19 because of its potential safety hazards, especially when taken concurrently with azithromycin and oseltamivir.
32330277,These findings cannot be extrapolated to patients with nonsevere COVID-19.
32330277,ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04323527.
32330288,With the developing COVID-19 pandemic, patients with inherited anaemias require specific advice regarding isolation and changes to usual treatment schedules.
32330288,The National Haemoglobinopathy Panel (NHP) has issued guidance on the care of patients with sickle cell disease, thalassaemia, Diamond Blackfan anaemia (DBA), congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia (CDA), sideroblastic anaemia, pyruvate kinase deficiency and other red cell enzyme and membrane disorders.
32330288,Cascading of accurate information for clinicians and patients is paramount to preventing adverse outcomes, such as patients who are at increased risk of fulminant bacterial infection due to their condition or its treatment erroneously self-isolating if their fever is mistakenly attributed to a viral cause, delaying potentially life-saving antibiotic therapy.
32330288,Outpatient visits should be minimised for most patients, however some, such as first transcranial dopplers for children with sickle cell anaemia should not be delayed as known risk of stroke will outweigh the unknown risk from COVID-19 infection.
32330288,Blood transfusion programmes should be continued, but specific changes to usual clinical pathways can be instituted to reduce risk of patient exposure to COVID-19, as well as contingency planning for possible reductions in blood available for transfusions.
32330288,Bone marrow transplants for these disorders should be postponed until further notice.
32330288,With the current lack of evidence on the risk and complications of COVID-19 infection in these patients, national data collection is ongoing to record outcomes and eventually to identify predictors of disease severity, particularly important if further waves of infection travel through the population.
32330293,As an emerging infectious disease, the clinical course and virological course of SARS-CoV-2 infection remain to be further investigated.
32330293,In this case report, we described a case of SARS-CoV-2 infection with clinical course more than two months.
32330293,This patient had recovered from the pneumonia after treatment.
32330293,The viral RNA of throat swabs became negative and the viral specific antibodies were produced during recovery period.
32330293,However, the viral RNA reappeared and additionally persisted in throat swabs for more than 40 days.
32330293,In addition, the viral RNA was detected in multiple types of specimens with extremely high titers in the saliva.
32330293,In conclusion, these findings indicate that SARS-CoV-2 can cause a long clinical course.
32330293,The coexistence of viral RNA and viral specific antibodies may imply an immune evasion of SARAS-CoV-2 from host's immune system.

32330303,Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by a novel betacoronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has rapidly developed into a pandemic since it was first reported in December 2019.
32330303,Nucleic acid testing is the standard method for the diagnosis of viral infections.
32330303,However, this method reportedly has a low positivity rate.
32330303,To increase the sensitivity of COVID-19 diagnoses, we developed an IgM-IgG combined assay and tested it in patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32330303,In total, 56 patients were enrolled in this study and SARS-CoV-2 was detected by using both IgM-IgG antibody and nucleic acid tests.
32330303,Clinical and laboratory data were collected and analyzed.
32330303,Our findings suggest that patients who develop severe illness might experience longer virus exposure times and develop a more severe inflammatory response.
32330303,The IgM-IgG test is an accurate and sensitive diagnostic method.
32330303,A combination of nucleic acid and IgM-IgG testing is a more sensitive and accurate approach for diagnosis and early treatment of COVID-19.
32330313,This study is to investigate the clinical characteristics of late pregnancy with asymptomatic 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) infection, evaluate the outcome of maternal and fetal prognosis, and identify the evidence of intrauterine vertical transmission.
32330313,A 22-years-old pregnant woman with asymptomatic COVID-19 infection who was admitted to our hospital on 11 February 2020 was enrolled in this study.
32330313,Clinical data including laboratory test results and chest computed tomography (CT) scanning were collected and reviewed.
32330313,Diagnosis of late pregnancy with asymptomatic COVID-19 infection was made.
32330313,Lumbar anesthesia for cesarean section was performed and a female baby was delivered uneventfully, with the Apgar score of 9 to 10 points.
32330313,Three times of COVID-19 nucleic acid test for the baby was negative after delivery.
32330313,The puerpera returned to normal after the operation and two times of throat swab COVID-19 nucleic acid test were all negative after antiviral therapy.
32330313,We reported an asymptomatic COVID-19 pregnant woman with detailed clinical information and our result indicated that for late pregnant women with asymptomatic COVID-19 infection, there might be no intrauterine infection caused by vertical transmission.
32330332,In December 2019, a cluster of patients with severe pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in the city of Wuhan, China.
32330332,The disease is now termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32330332,In the early reports, the patients were mainly middle-aged and elderly men, and children appeared to be less susceptible to this infection.
32330332,With modern and efficient transportation, the disease quickly spread to almost all corners of the world and the mortality far exceeds that caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus.
32330332,As the number of children with COVID-19 gradually increases, the disease has been documented in premature babies, infants, children, and adolescents.
32330332,Severe and fatal cases in children are relatively rare.
32330332,The burden of disease in children has been relatively low, but the high proportions of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infections in children deserve careful attention.
32330332,A clear understanding of the immune responses to the virus in children and the transmission potential of asymptomatic children is of paramount importance for the development of specific treatments and vaccine in order to effectively control the ongoing pandemic.
32330521,Prior epidemics of high-mortality human coronaviruses, such as the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV or SARS-1) in 2003, have driven the characterization of compounds that could be possibly active against the currently emerging novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19).
32330521,Presently, no approved treatment or prophylaxis is available for COVID-19.
32330521,We comment on the existing COVID-19 research methodologies in general and the published reporting.
32330521,Given the media attention and claims of effectiveness, we chose chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, in combination with azithromycin, as an area of COVID-19 research to examine.
32330521,MEDLINE and EMBASE electronic databases were searched from 2019 to present (April 3rd, 2020) using a mix of keywords such as COVID-19 and chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine.
32330521,We also searched the largest clinical medicine preprint repository, medRxiv.org.
32330521,We found 6 studies, 3 randomized control trials and 3 observational studies, focusing on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine (with azithromycin).
32330521,We critically appraised the evidence.
32330521,We found that the COVID-19 research methodology is very poor in the area of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine research.
32330521,In screening the literature, we observed the same across COVID-19 research in relation to potential treatments.
32330521,The reporting is very poor and sparse, and patient-important outcomes needed to discern decision-making priorities are not reported.
32330521,We do understand the barriers to perform rigorous research in health care settings overwhelmed by a novel deadly disease.
32330521,However, this emergency pandemic situation does not transform flawed methods and data into credible results.
32330521,The adequately powered, comparative, and robust clinical research that is needed for optimal evidence-informed decision-making remains absent in COVID-19.
32330817,An ongoing pandemic of COVID-19 that started in Hubei, China has resulted in massive strain on the healthcare infrastructure in Lombardy, Italy.
32330817,The management of these patients is still evolving.
32330817,This is a single-center observational cohort study of critically ill patients infected with COVID-19.
32330817,Bedside clinicians abstracted daily patient data on history, treatment, and short-term course.
32330817,We describe management and a proposed severity scale for treatment used in this hospital. 44 patients were enrolled; with incomplete information on 11.
32330817,Of the 33 studied patients, 91% were male, median age 64; 88% were overweight or obese. 45% were hypertensive, 12% had been taking an ACE-inhibitor.
32330817,Noninvasive ventilation was performed on 39% of patients for part or all or their ICU stay with no provider infection.
32330817,Most patients received antibiotics for pneumonia.
32330817,Patients also received lopinivir/ritonavir (82%), hydroxychloroquine (79%), and tocilizumab (12%) according to this treatment algorithm.
32330817,Nine of 10 patients survived their ICU course and were transferred to the floor, with one dying in the ICU.
32330817,ICU patients with COVID-19 frequently have hypertension.
32330817,Many could be managed with noninvasive ventilation, despite the risk of aerosolization.
32330817,The use of a severity scale augmented clinician management.
32330858,The COVID-19 pandemic demands reassessment of head and neck oncology treatment paradigms.
32330858,Head and neck cancer (HNC) patients are generally at high-risk for COVID-19 infection and severe adverse outcomes.
32330858,Further, there are new, multilevel COVID-19-specific risks to patients, surgeons, health care workers (HCWs), institutions and society.
32330858,Urgent guidance in the delivery of safe, quality head and neck oncologic care is needed.
32330858,Novel barriers to safe HNC surgery include: (1) imperfect presurgical screening for COVID-19; (2) prolonged SARS-CoV-2 aerosolization; (3) occurrence of multiple, potentially lengthy, aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) within a single surgery; (4) potential incompatibility of enhanced personal protective equipment (PPE) with routine operative equipment; (5) existential or anticipated PPE shortages.
32330858,Additionally, novel, COVID-19-specific multilevel risks to HNC patients, HCWs and institutions, and society include: use of immunosuppressive therapy, nosocomial COVID-19 transmission, institutional COVID-19 outbreaks, and, at some locations, societal resource deficiencies requiring health care rationing.
32330858,Traditional head and neck oncology doctrines require reassessment given the extraordinary COVID-19-specific risks of surgery.
32330858,Emergent, comprehensive management of these novel, multilevel surgical risks are needed.
32330858,Until these risks are managed, we temporarily favor nonsurgical therapy over surgery for most mucosal squamous cell carcinomas, wherein surgery and nonsurgical therapy are both first-line options.
32330858,Where surgery is traditionally preferred, we recommend multidisciplinary evaluation of multilevel surgical-risks, discussion of possible alternative nonsurgical therapies and shared-decision-making with the patient.
32330858,Where surgery remains indicated, we recommend judicious preoperative planning and development of COVID-19-specific perioperative protocols to maximize the safety and quality of surgical and oncologic care.
32330970,Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection occurring during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of preterm delivery.
32330970,This case report describes successful treatment of preterm labor during acute COVID-19 infection.
32330970,Standard treatment for preterm labor may allow patients with acute COVID-19 infection to recover without the need for preterm delivery.
32330970,KEY POINTS: · Acute COVID-19 infection is associated with a high rate of preterm delivery..
32330970,· Standard treatment for preterm labor such as intravenous magnesium sulfate, antepartum steroid therapy and antibiotic prophylaxis for group B streptococcus infection were effective in this patient..
32330970,· In the absence of maternal or fetal compromise, acute COVID-19 infection is not an indication for early elective delivery..
32331217,Since the beginning of March 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused more than 13,000 deaths in Europe, almost 54% of which has occurred in Italy.
32331217,The Italian healthcare system is experiencing a stressful burden, especially in terms of intensive care assistance.
32331217,In fact, the main clinical manifestation of COVID-19 patients is represented by an acute hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, that in many cases, results in an acute respiratory distress syndrome and requires an invasive ventilator support.
32331217,A precocious respiratory support with non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen should be avoided to limit the droplets' air-dispersion and the healthcare workers' contamination.
32331217,The application of a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) by means of a helmet can represent an effective alternative to recruit diseased alveolar units and improve hypoxemia.
32331217,It can also limit the room contamination, improve comfort for the patients, and allow for better clinical assistance with long-term tolerability.
32331217,However, the initiation of a CPAP is not free from pitfalls.
32331217,It requires a careful titration and monitoring to avoid a delayed intubation.
32331217,Here, we discuss the rationale and some important considerations about timing, criteria, and monitoring requirements for patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure requiring a CPAP treatment.
32331255,The ongoing episode of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) has imposed a serious threat to global health and the world economy.
32331255,The disease has rapidly acquired a pandemic status affecting almost all populated areas of the planet.
32331255,The causative agent of COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2.
32331255,The virus has an approximate 30 kb single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome, which is 74.5% to 99% identical to that of SARS-CoV, CoV-pangolin, and the coronavirus the from horseshoe bat.
32331255,According to available information, SARS-CoV-2 is inferred to be a recombinant virus that originated from bats and was transmitted to humans, possibly using the pangolin as the intermediate host.
32331255,The interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with the human ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) receptor, and its subsequent cleavage by serine protease and fusion, are the main events in the pathophysiology.
32331255,The serine protease inhibitors, spike protein-based vaccines, or ACE2 blockers may have therapeutic potential in the near future.
32331255,At present, no vaccine is available against COVID-19.
32331255,The disease is being treated with antiviral, antimalarial, anti-inflammatory, herbal medicines, and active plasma antibodies.
32331255,In this context, the present review article provides a cumulative account of the recent information regarding the viral characteristics, potential therapeutic targets, treatment options, and prospective research questions.
32331343,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) disease (COVID-19) appears to have a higher mortality rate in presence of comorbidities and in men.
32331343,The latter suggests the presence of a possible sex-dependent susceptibility.
32331343,An enzymatic system involved in this different predisposition could be represented by angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
32331343,ACE2 is activated and down-regulated by the spike protein of the virus and allows the penetration of SARS-CoV-2 into epithelial cells and myocardium.
32331343,Data on the experimental animal have shown that 17ß-estradiol increases the expression and activity of ACE2 in both adipose tissue and kidney.
32331343,Spontaneously hypertensive male mice have a higher myocardial ACE2 expression than females and its levels decrease after orchiectomy.
32331343,In addition to this first aspect, the recent evidence of an increased frequency of venous thromboembolism in patients with COVID-19 (a clinical element associated with a worse prognosis) calls the attention on the safety of treatment with testosterone, in particular in hypogonadal men with greater genetic predisposition.
32331343,Evidence that sex hormones are able to modulate the expression of ACE2 could help in interpreting epidemiological results and in designing more appropriate intervention strategies.
32331343,Moreover, the vitamin D deficiency in elderly men may be worthy of further study regarding the epidemiological aspects of this different susceptibility and lethality between sexes.
32332319,Neurological symptoms and gastrointestinal symptoms were rare at onset in COVID-19.
32332319,Here we report a 37-year-old man with vertigo, fever, and diarrhea symptoms as the first manifestation.
32332319,F-FDG PET/CT spotted multiple ground glass opacity (GGO) lesions in the lungs, with increased tracer uptake in both lung GGOs and the whole colon.
32332319,Serial CT examinations showed the emersion and dissipation of lung GGOs.
32332319,We illustrate the symptoms initiation, the laboratory test results, the imaging examination, and the treatment strategy in the duration of COVID-19 with a timeline chart.
32332481,The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak has rapidly spread across the world.
32332481,As medical systems continue to develop vaccines and treatments, it is crucial for the public health community to establish nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) that can effectively mitigate the rate of SARS-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) spread across highly populated residential areas, especially among individuals who have close contact with confirmed cases.
32332481,A community-driven preparedness strategy has been implemented in metropolitan areas in China.
32332481,The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC) has required that all COVID-19 confirmed cases be recorded and documented in a national notifiable disease surveillance system (NDSS).
32332481,After receiving reports of newly confirmed cases, an epidemiological services team at the CCDC or trained medical professionals at local clinical facilities start a case-contact investigation.
32332481,A task force performs home visits to infected individuals.
32332481,Persons under investigation (PUIs) can stay in designated quarantine facilities for 14 days or in special circumstances can be quarantined at home.
32332481,This community-based approach involved all stakeholders including local public health departments, public safety authorities, neighborhood councils, and community health centers.
32332765,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019, and there are currently no specific antiviral treatments or vaccines available.
32332765,SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to use the same cell entry receptor as SARS-CoV, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
32332765,In this report, we generate a recombinant protein by connecting the extracellular domain of human ACE2 to the Fc region of the human immunoglobulin IgG1.
32332765,A fusion protein containing an ACE2 mutant with low catalytic activity is also used in this study.
32332765,The fusion proteins are then characterized.
32332765,Both fusion proteins have a high binding affinity for the receptor-binding domains of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 and exhibit desirable pharmacological properties in mice.
32332765,Moreover, the fusion proteins neutralize virus pseudotyped with SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins in vitro.
32332765,As these fusion proteins exhibit cross-reactivity against coronaviruses, they have potential applications in the diagnosis, prophylaxis, and treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
32333185,Our public health approaches to addressing COVID-19 are heavily dependent on social and behavioral change strategies to halt transmissions.
32333185,To date, biomedical forms of curative and preventative treatments for COVID-19 are at best limited.
32333185,Four decades into the HIV epidemic we have learned a considerable amount of information regarding social and behavioral approaches to addressing disease transmission.
32333185,Here we outline broad, scoping lessons learned from the HIV literature tailored to the nature of what we currently know about COVID-19.
32333185,We focus on multiple levels of intervention including intrapersonal, interpersonal, community, and social factors, each of which provide a reference point for understanding and elaborating on social/behavioral lessons learned from HIV prevention and treatment research.
32333185,The investments in HIV prevention and treatment research far outweigh any infectious disease in the history of public health, that is, until now with the emergence of COVID-19.
32333196,As we know more about the clinical and laboratory features of COVID-19, which is now accepted as a pandemic, many questions have been raised about how to manage and monitor the treatment of cancer patients.
32333196,It was determined that the incidence of lymphopenia increased in COVID-19 and there was a significant relationship between lymphopenia and mortality.
32333196,This can be thought of as an unresponsive problem in how to maintain anti-cancer drugs that cause lymphopenia.
32333196,This article was written for a hypothetical approach in cancer patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in order to be an idea of collecting data for treatment with anti-cancer drugs that cause lymphopenia.
32333248,In the early February, 2020, we called up an experts' committee with more than 30 Chinese experts from 11 national medical academic organizations to formulate the first edition of consensus statement on diagnosis, treatment and prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children, which has been published in this journal.
32333248,With accumulated experiences in the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 in children, we have updated the consensus statement and released the second edition recently.
32333248,The current version in English is a condensed version of the second edition of consensus statement on diagnosis, treatment and prevention of COVID-19 in children.
32333248,In the current version, diagnosis and treatement criteria have been optimized, and early identification of severe and critical cases is highlighted.
32333248,The early warning indicators for severe pediatric cases have been summarized which is utmost important for clinical practice.
32333248,This version of experts consensus will be valuable for better prevention, diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 in children worldwide.
32333293,The COVID-19 pandemic presents clinicians a unique set of challenges in managing breast cancer (BC) patients.
32333293,As hospital resources and staff become more limited during the COVID-19 pandemic, it becomes critically important to define which BC patients require more urgent care and which patients can wait for treatment until the pandemic is over.
32333293,In this Special Communication, we use expert opinion of representatives from multiple cancer care organizations to categorize BC patients into priority levels (A, B, C) for urgency of care across all specialties.
32333293,Additionally, we provide treatment recommendations for each of these patient scenarios.
32333293,Priority A patients have conditions that are immediately life threatening or symptomatic requiring urgent treatment.
32333293,Priority B patients have conditions that do not require immediate treatment but should start treatment before the pandemic is over.
32333293,Priority C patients have conditions that can be safely deferred until the pandemic is over.
32333293,The implementation of these recommendations for patient triage, which are based on the highest level available evidence, must be adapted to current availability of hospital resources and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic in each region of the country.
32333293,Additionally, the risk of disease progression and worse outcomes for patients need to be weighed against the risk of patient and staff exposure to SARS CoV-2 (virus associated with the COVID-19 pandemic).
32333293,Physicians should use these recommendations to prioritize care for their BC patients and adapt treatment recommendations to the local context at their hospital.
32333494,Racial disparities in COVID-19 infection rates and disease severity are due to a multifactorial etiology that can include socioeconomic as well as other factors.
32333494,Nevertheless, genetic factors in different ethnic groups often contribute to disease severity and treatment response.
32333494,In particular, the frequency of genetic variations in the androgen receptor differs by ethnicity and gender.
32333494,For example, the increased prevalence of prostate cancer and androgenetic alopecia among African Americans correlates with the frequency of these variants.
32333494,In this communication, we propose that androgens may be implicated in COVID-19 disease severity.
32333494,As such, special attention may need to be given to African Americans infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
32333494,Finally, if a link to genetic variations in the androgen receptor and COVID-19 disease severity can be established, it would suggest new treatment options.
32333552,Most medical centers are postponing elective procedures and deferring non-urgent clinic visits to conserve hospital resources and prevent spread of COVID-19.
32333552,The pandemic crisis presents some unique challenges for patients currently being treated with deep brain stimulation (DBS).
32333552,Movement disorder (Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, dystonia), neuropsychiatric disorder (obsessive compulsive disorder, Tourette syndrome, depression), and epilepsy patients can develop varying degrees of symptom worsening from interruption of therapy due to neurostimulator battery reaching end of life, device malfunction or infection.
32333552,Urgent intervention to maintain or restore stimulation may be required for patients with Parkinson's disease who can develop a rare but potentially life-threatening complication known as DBS-withdrawal syndrome.
32333552,Similarly, patients with generalized dystonia can develop status dystonicus, patients with obsessive compulsive disorder can become suicidal, and epilepsy patients can experience potentially life-threatening worsening of seizures as a result of therapy cessation.
32333552,DBS system infection can require urgent, and rarely emergent surgery.
32333552,Elective interventions including new implantations and initial programming should be postponed.
32333552,For patients with existing DBS systems, the battery status and electrical integrity interrogation can now be performed using patient programmers, and employed through telemedicine visits or by phone consultations.
32333552,The decision for replacement of the implantable pulse generator to prevent interruption of DBS therapy should be made on a case-by-case basis taking into consideration battery status and a patient's tolerance to potential therapy disruption.
32333552,Scheduling of the procedures, however, depends heavily on the hospital system regulations and on triage procedures with respect to safety and resource utilization during the health crisis.
32333601,Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have intestinal inflammation and are treated with immune-modulating medications.
32333601,In the face of the coronavirus disease-19 pandemic, we do not know whether patients with IBD will be more susceptible to infection or disease.
32333601,We hypothesized that the viral entry molecules angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) are expressed in the intestine.
32333601,We further hypothesized that their expression could be affected by inflammation or medication usage.
32333601,We examined the expression of Ace2 and Tmprss2 by quantitative polymerase chain reacion in animal models of IBD.
32333601,Publicly available data from organoids and mucosal biopsies from patients with IBD were examined for expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2.
32333601,We conducted RNA sequencing for CD11b-enriched cells and peripheral and lamina propria T-cells from well-annotated patient samples.
32333601,ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were abundantly expressed in the ileum and colon and had high expression in intestinal epithelial cells.
32333601,In animal models, inflammation led to downregulation of epithelial Ace2.
32333601,Expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was not increased in samples from patients with compared with those of control patients.
32333601,In CD11b-enriched cells but not T-cells, the level of expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the mucosa was comparable to other functional mucosal genes and was not affected by inflammation.
32333601,Anti-tumor necrosis factor drugs, vedolizumab, ustekinumab, and steroids were linked to significantly lower expression of ACE2 in CD11b-enriched cells.
32333601,The viral entry molecules ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are expressed in the ileum and colon.
32333601,Patients with IBD do not have higher expression during inflammation; medical therapy is associated with lower levels of ACE2.
32333601,These data provide reassurance for patients with IBD.
32333823,Autoimmune bullous diseases (AIBDs) are potentially life-threatening disorders comprising intra-epidermal/epithelial (pemphigus) and sub-epidermal/epithelial blistering diseases (pemphigoid and dermatitis herpetiformis).
32333823,Corticosteroids and non-steroid immunomodulatory agents are the mainstays of treatment.
32333823,Treatment can be challenging particularly in pemphigus, mucous membrane pemphigoid, and epidermolysis bullosa acquisita which may require more intense immunosuppressive approaches.
32333929,The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, has affected virtually all aspects of patient care.
32333929,Health-care systems around the world are trying simultaneously to treat patients with COVID-19, prepare for its long-term impacts, and treat patients with other acute and chronic diseases.
32333929,There are multiple ways that the COVID-19 pandemic will directly affect patients with fibrotic interstitial lung disease (ILD), particularly given their common risk factors for poor outcomes.
32333929,Major issues for patients with ILD will include restricted access to key components of the diagnostic process, new uncertainties in the use of common ILD pharmacotherapies, limited ability to monitor both disease severity and the presence of medication adverse effects, and significantly curtailed research activities.
32333929,The purpose of this review is to summarize how COVID-19 has impacted key components of the diagnosis and management of fibrotic ILD as well as to provide strategies to mitigate these challenges.
32333929,We further review major obstacles for researchers and identify priority areas for future ILD research related to COVID-19.
32333929,Our goals are to provide practical considerations to support the care of patients with ILD during the COVID-19 pandemic and to provide a road map for clinicians caring for these patients during future infectious disease outbreaks.
32334062,As of April 15, 2020, the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) pandemic has swept through 213 countries and infected more than 1,870,000 individuals, posing an unprecedented threat to international health and the economy.
32334062,There is currently no specific treatment available for patients with COVID-19 infection.
32334062,The lessons learned from past management of respiratory viral infections have provided insights into treating COVID-19.
32334062,Numerous potential therapies, including supportive intervention, immunomodulatory agents, antiviral therapy, and convalescent plasma transfusion, have been tentatively applied in clinical settings.
32334062,A number of these therapies have provided substantially curative benefits in treating patients with COVID-19 infection.
32334062,Furthermore, intensive research and clinical trials are underway to assess the efficacy of existing drugs and identify potential therapeutic targets to develop new drugs for treating COVID-19.
32334062,Herein, we summarize the current potential therapeutic approaches for diseases related to COVID-19 infection and introduce their mechanisms of action, safety, and effectiveness.
32334158,The coronavirus pandemic, which has numerous global implications, has led people to believe that nothing will be the same as before.
32334158,The present day is dominated by studies on determining the factors that affect, taking preventive actions, and trying to find an effective treatment on top priority.
32334158,Meteorological parameters are among the crucial factors affecting infectious diseases.
32334158,The present study examines the correlation between weather and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by considering nine cities in Turkey.
32334158,In this regard, temperature (°C), dew point (°C), humidity (%), and wind speed (mph) are considered as parameters of weather.
32334158,Research states that the incubation period of COVID-19 varies from 1 day to 14 days.
32334158,Therefore, the effects of each parameter within 1, 3, 7, and 14 days are examined.
32334158,In addition, the population is included as an effective parameter for evaluation.
32334158,The analyses are conducted based on Spearman's correlation coefficients.
32334158,The results showed that the highest correlations were observed for population, wind speed 14 days ago, and temperature on the day, respectively.
32334158,The study results may guide authorities and decision-makers on taking specific measures for the cities.
32334163,Since December 2019, a respiratory pandemic named as coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) caused by a new coronavirus named as SARS-CoV-2, has taken the world by storm.
32334163,The symptoms are fever, malaise, and cough which resolve in a few days in most cases; but may progress to respiratory distress and organ failure.
32334163,Transmission is through droplet infection or fomites, but other modes such as airborne transmission and oro-fecal transmission are also speculated.
32334163,Research is underway to develop effective vaccines and medicines for the disease.
32334163,In such a scenario, we present the measures described in Unani system of medicine for health protection during epidemics.
32334163,Unani is a traditional system of medicine developed during the middle ages, which employs natural drugs of herbal, animal and mineral origin for treatment.
32334163,In Unani medicine, during an epidemic, apart from isolation and quarantine, three measures are of utmost importance, (i) purification of surroundings using certain herbal drugs as fumigants or sprays, (ii) health promotion and immune-modulation, and (iii) use of health-protecting drugs and symptom-specific drugs.
32334163,Drugs such as loban (Styrax benzoides W.
32334163,G.
32334163,Craib), sandroos (Hymenaea verrucosa Gaertn.) za'fran (Crocus sativus L.), vinegar etc. are prescribed in various forms.
32334163,Scientific researches on these drugs reveal the presence of a number of pharmacologically active substances, which may provide a new insight into the management of infections and epidemics.
32334182,The December 2019 outbreak of coronavirus has once again thrown the vexed issue of quarantine into the spotlight, with many countries asking their citizens to 'self-isolate' if they have potentially come into contact with the infection.
32334182,However, adhering to quarantine is difficult.
32334182,Decisions on how to apply quarantine should be based on the best available evidence to increase the likelihood of people adhering to protocols.
32334182,We conducted a rapid review to identify factors associated with adherence to quarantine during infectious disease outbreaks.
32334182,The study design is a rapid evidence review.
32334182,We searched Medline, PsycINFO and Web of Science for published literature on the reasons for and factors associated with adherence to quarantine during an infectious disease outbreak.
32334182,We found 3163 articles and included 14 in the review.
32334182,Adherence to quarantine ranged from as little as 0 up to 92.8%.
32334182,The main factors which influenced or were associated with adherence decisions were the knowledge people had about the disease and quarantine procedure, social norms, perceived benefits of quarantine and perceived risk of the disease, as well as practical issues such as running out of supplies or the financial consequences of being out of work.
32334182,People vary in their adherence to quarantine during infectious disease outbreaks.
32334182,To improve this, public health officials should provide a timely, clear rationale for quarantine and information about protocols; emphasise social norms to encourage this altruistic behaviour; increase the perceived benefit that engaging in quarantine will have on public health; and ensure that sufficient supplies of food, medication and other essentials are provided.
32334323,The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) associated disease (COVID-19) outbreak seriously challenges globally all health care systems and professionals.
32334323,Expert projections estimate that despite social distancing and lockdown being practiced, we have yet to feel the full impact of COVID-19.
32334323,In this manuscript we provide guidance to prepare for the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on breast cancer patients and advise on how to triage, prioritize and organize diagnostic procedures, surgical, radiation and medical treatments.
32334502,Multiple viral pathogens can pose a significant health risk to individuals.
32334502,As a recentexample, the β-coronavirus family virion, SARS-CoV-2, has quickly evolved as a pandemic leadingto coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and has been declared by the World Health Organizationas a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.
32334502,To date, no definitive treatment orvaccine application exists for COVID-19.
32334502,Although new investigations seek to repurpose existingantiviral treatments for COVID-19, innovative treatment strategies not normally considered tohave antiviral capabilities may be critical to address this global concern.
32334502,One such avenue that mayprove to be exceedingly fruitful and offer exciting potential as new antiviral therapy involves themechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and its associated pathways of mTOR Complex 1(mTORC1), mTOR Complex 2 (mTORC2), and AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK).
32334502,Recentwork has shown that mTOR pathways in conjunction with AMPK may offer valuable targets tocontrol cell injury, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and the onset of hyperinflammation,a significant disability associated with COVID-19.
32334502,Furthermore, pathways that can activatemTOR may be necessary for anti-hepatitis C activity, reduction of influenza A virus replication,and vital for type-1 interferon responses with influenza vaccination.
32334502,Yet, important considerationsfor the development of safe and effective antiviral therapy with mTOR pathways exist.
32334502,Undersome conditions, mTOR can act as a double edge sword and participate in virion replication andvirion release from cells.
32334502,Future work with mTOR as a potential antiviral target is highly warrantedand with a greater understanding of this novel pathway, new treatments against several viralpathogens may successfully emerge.
32334535,The world is currently dominated by the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
32334535,Besides the obvious concerns about limitation of virus spread and providing the best possible care to infected patients, a concomitant concern has now arisen in view of a putative link between the use of certain drugs, such as Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) inhibitors and ibuprofen, and an increased risk for COVID-19 infection.
32334535,We here discuss this concern in relation to headache treatment and conclude that, based on current evidence, there is no reason to abandon treatment of headache patients with RAS inhibitors or ibuprofen.
32334800,COVID-19 disease is a pandemic disease caused by a single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the coronavirus family known as 2019-nCoV (SARS-CoV-2).
32334800,The disease is highly contagious and transmitted mainly by droplets or close contact.
32334800,As the global incidence of COVID-19 disease is increasing dramatically, health systems worldwide started to suffer in terms of its capability to manage affected people and the ability to provide standard treatment for critically ill patients in a safe environment.
32334800,As Medical staff has extensive contact with patients, families as well as other health care providers, they are very likely to cause cross-infection.
32334800,This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of COVID-19 disease as well as to highlight essential measures that healthcare providers and surgeons need to take into consideration during their management of the patient during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32334905,The COVID-19 outbreak grows exponentially in our country.
32334905,Despite most of patients develops benign symptoms, cancer patients are at risk of a severe form of the disease.
32334905,Radiotherapy centres are a potential contamination place due to the number of patients treated and staff present.
32334905,Their organization during the outbreak period aims to ensure continuity of care while limiting the risk of death from COVID-19.
32334905,In the radiotherapy department of Mulhouse hospital (France), we pointed five points out: protection of medical and paramedical staff, protection of patients undergoing treatment, detection of patients suspected of being infected by SARS-CoV-2 and their management, reorganization of the patient circuit and measures regarding the quality management.
32334905,This reflection, which began at the beginning of the outbreak in our city, allows us to preserve the access to radiotherapy treatments by anticipating the risk of spreading the virus.
32334905,Through biweekly meetings, we continue to adapt to the epidemic in our department, considering our material resources.
32334905,The ability to perform diagnostic tests in all suspect patients would also allow us to refine our procedures.
32335097,Diabetes could be a risk factor for severity and mortality in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 COVID-19.
32335097,It has been hypothesized that DPP4 inhibition, a therapy currently available for type 2 diabetes, might represent a target for decreasing the risk of the acute respiratory complications of the COVID-19 infection but (1) lack of demonstration of SARS-CoV2 binding to DPP4 (2) possible protective role of sDPP4 in Middle East respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) (3) demonstrated inhibition and downregulation of DPP4 by HIV1 and MERS-CoV and (4) not exclusive role of the receptor binding in tropism of the Coronavirus family, support that DPP4 inhibition at present doesn't represent a plausible approach to mitigate COVID-19.
32335281,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the previously unknown pathogen, severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is now a global pandemic.
32335281,There are no vaccines or specific treatments against this new virus; therefore, there is an urgent need to advance novel therapeutic interventions for COVID-19.
32335281,Glycyrrhizin is a triterpene saponin with various biological functions and pharmacological effects.
32335281,This brief article discusses the therapeutic potential of glycyrrhizin for the treatment of COVID-19 from the perspective of its pharmacological action, including binding angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2), downregulating proinflammatory cytokines, inhibiting the accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), inhibiting thrombin, inhibiting the hyperproduction of airway exudates, and inducing endogenous interferon.
32335367,As a result of its rapid spread in various countries around the world, on March 11, 2020, WHO issued an announcement of the change in coronavirus disease 2019 status from epidemic to pandemic disease.
32335367,The virus that causes this disease is indicated originating from animals traded in a live animal market in Wuhan, China.
32335367,Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 can attack lung cells because there are many conserved receptor entries, namely Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2.
32335367,The presence of this virus in host cells will initiate various protective responses leading to pneumonia and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.
32335367,This review aimed to provide an overview related to this virus and examine the body's responses and possible therapies.
32335367,We searched PubMed databases for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2, Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus.
32335367,Full texts were retrieved, analyzed and developed into an easy-to-understand review.
32335367,We provide a complete review related to structure, origin, and how the body responds to this virus infection and explain the possibility of an immune system over-reaction or cytokine storm.
32335367,We also include an explanation of how this virus creates modes of avoidance to evade immune system attacks.
32335367,We further explain the therapeutic approaches that can be taken in the treatment and prevention of this viral infection.
32335367,In summary, based on the structural and immune-evasion system of coronavirus, we suggest several approaches to treat the disease.
32335406,Factors associated with negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in hospitalized patients have not yet been systematically determined.
32335406,We conducted a retrospective cohort study of COVID-19 patients in Qingdao, China.
32335406,Both univariate and multivariate analysis were performed to identify independent factors for time to viral RNA negative conversion.
32335406,Data on patients with re-detectable viral RNA after showing negative on RT-PCR test (intermittent negative status) were also analyzed.
32335406,A total of 59 patients confirmed with COVID-19 were included in this study, with a median duration of 1 (interquartile range, IQR: 0-2) day from symptom onset to hospital admission.
32335406,Median communicable period (from first day of positive nucleic acid test to first day of consecutive negative results) was 14 (IQR: 10-18) days, and 7 (IQR: 6-10) days for 10 patients with intermittent negative results.
32335406,Age older than 45 years (hazard ratio, HR: 0.378; 95% confidence interval, CI: 0.205-0.698) and chest tightness (HR: 0.290; 95%CI: 0.091-0.919) were factors indecently affecting negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
32335406,Headache (odds ratio: 7.553; 95%CI: 1.011-28.253) was significantly associated with intermittent negative status, with a predicted probability of 60%.
32335406,Older age and chest tightness were independently associated with delayed clearance of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in hospitalized patients.
32335406,These predictors would provide a new perspective on early identification of patients with prolonged viral shedding and facilitate optimal isolation protocols and treatment strategies.
32335426,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is highly contagious, mainly causing inflammatory lesions in the lungs, and can also cause damage to the intestine and liver.
32335426,The rapid spread of the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia has posed complex challenges to global public health.
32335426,Early detection, isolation, diagnosis, and treatment are the most effective means of prevention and control.
32335426,At present, the epidemic situation of new coronavirus infection has tended to be controlled in China, and it is still in a period of rapid rise in much of the world.
32335426,The current gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19 is the detection of coronavirus nucleic acids, but imaging has an important role in the detection of lung lesions, stratification, evaluation of treatment strategies, and differentiation of mixed infections.
32335426,This Chinese expert consensus statement summarizes the imaging features of COVID-19 pneumonia and may help radiologists across the world to understand this disease better.
32335561,The COVID-19 pandemic represents the greatest global public health crisis since the pandemic influenza outbreak of 1918.
32335561,We are facing a new virus, so several antiviral agents previously used to treat other coronavirus infections such as SARS and MERS are being considered as the first potential candidates to treat COVID-19.
32335561,Thus, several agents have been used by the beginning of the current outbreak in China first and all over the word successively, as reported in several different guidelines and therapeutic recommendations.
32335561,At the same time, a great number of clinical trials have been launched to investigate the potential efficacy therapies for COVID-19 highlighting the urgent need to get as quickly as possible high-quality evidence.
32335561,Through PubMed, we explored the relevant articles published on treatment of COVID-19 and on trials ongoing up to April 15, 2020.
32335585,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a newly emerged disease that has become a global public health concern as it rapidly spread around the world.
32335585,The etiologic agent responsible for this disease has been named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses as it shows similar genomic features to that of SARS-CoV which caused a pandemic in 2002.
32335585,This disease first appeared in Hubei province of China and it follows human-to-human transmission but the path this virus took to set up human infection remains a mystery.
32335585,By 17 April 2020, globally there have been 2,074,529 confirmed cases with 139,378 deaths because of COVID-19.
32335585,SARS-CoV-2 shows several similarities with SARS?
32335585,CoV, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) with its clinical presentations.
32335585,This can vary from asymptomatic infection to severe disease and mortality.
32335585,Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) screening is considered as the standard laboratory test for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
32335585,There is no proven antiviral agent against SARS-CoV-2 so the treatment for COVID-19 is symptomatic, aiming for the management of the symptoms and prevention of the complications.
32335585,The outbreak of COVID-19 has led to the implementation of extraordinary public health measures throughout the world.
32335585,Numerous antiviral compounds used to treat other infections are being clinically researched to find possible treatment.
32335585,Similarly, the traditional public health outbreak response strategy of isolation, quarantine, social distancing and community containment has been implemented in multiple countries and has played an important role in the prevention of new outbreaks.
32335585,This review aims to enhance our understanding of COVID 19.
32335585,Keywords: Coronavirus disease 2019; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; novel coronavirus 2019; severe acute respiratory syndrome-2.
32335900,The current international COVID-19 health crisis underlines the importance of adequate and suitable personal protective equipment for clinical staff during acute airway management.
32335900,This study compares the impacts of standard air-purifying respirators and powered air-purifying respirators during simulated difficult airway scenarios.
32335900,Twenty-five anaesthetists carried out four different standardised difficult intubation drills, either unprotected (control), or wearing a standard or a powered respirator.
32335900,Treatment times and wearer comfort were determined and compared.
32335900,In the wearer comfort evaluation form, operators rated mobility, noise, heat, vision and speech intelligibility.
32335900,All anaesthetists accomplished the treatment objectives of all study arms without adverse events.
32335900,Total mean (SD) intubation times for the four interventions did not show significant differences between the powered and the standard respirator groups, being 16.4 (8.6) vs.
32335900,19.2 (5.2) seconds with the Airtraq™; 11.4 (3.4) vs.
32335900,10.0 (2.1) seconds with the videolaryngoscope; 39.2 (4.5) vs.
32335900,40.1 (4.8) seconds with the fibreoptic bronchoscope scope; and 15.4 (5.7) vs.
32335900,15.1 (5.0) seconds for standard tracheal intubation by direct laryngoscopy, respectively.
32335900,Videolaryngoscopy allowed the shortest intubation times regardless of the respiratory protective device used.
32335900,Anaesthetists rated heat and vision significantly higher in the powered respirator group; however, noise levels were perceived to be significantly lower than in the standard respirator group.
32335900,We conclude that standard and powered respirators do not significantly prolong simulated advanced intubation procedures.
32336069,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) is the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19).
32336069,The most common symptoms of COVID‑19 are: fever (81.8%-100%), cough (46.3%-86.2%), myalgia and fatigue (11%-50%), expectoration (4.4%-72%), and dyspnea (18.6%-59%).
32336069,The most common laboratory abnormalities in COVID‑19 include decreased lymphocyte count (35%-82.1%), thrombocytopenia (17%-36.2%), elevated serum C‑reactive protein (60.7%-93%), lactate dehydrogenase (41%-76%), and D‑dimer concentrations (36%-46.4%).
32336069,Among comorbidities in patients with COVID‑19, cardiovascular disease is most commonly found.
32336069,In addition, patients with concomitant cardiovascular diseases have worse prognosis and more often require admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), compared with patients without such comorbidities.
32336069,It is estimated that about 20% of patients with COVID‑19 develop cardiac injury.
32336069,Cardiac injury is more prevalent among patients with COVID‑19 who require ICU care.
32336069,In a group of critically ill patients, 27.5% had an elevated N‑terminal pro-B‑type natriuretic peptide concentration, and increased cardiac troponin level was found in 10% of patients.
32336069,One of the life‑threatening cardiac manifestations is coronavirus fulminant myocarditis, which may also occur without accompanying symptoms of pulmonary involvement.
32336069,Early recognition and treatment is crucial in these cases.
32336069,So far, data on the incidence of arrhythmias in patients with COVID‑19 are limited.
32336069,Coronavirus disease 2019 impacts patients with cardiovascular comorbidities and affects daily practice of cardiologists.
32336069,Thus, it is important to know typical COVID‑19 symptoms, possible clinical manifestations, complications, and recommended treatment.
32336080,Infection due to severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), i.e.
32336080,Coronavirus-associated disease 2019 (COVID-2019), may occasionally lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), requiring in the most severe cases extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
32336080,Yet, limited data, if any, are currently available on the role of ECMO in critically ill patients with COVID-19.
32336080,We aimed at providing a snapshot analysis of ECMO for COVID-19 in Europe.
32336080,Freely available data on ECMO in COVID-19 patients reported by the European Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (EuroELSO) were extracted and analyzed after conversion into long format.
32336080,The primary outcome was the incidence of death during ECMO.
32336080,Bootstrapping and logistic regression was used for inferential estimates.
32336080,Details from a total of 333 patients treated in 90 institutions spanning 17 countries were obtained, with 22% women and mean age of 52 years.
32336080,Death rate was 17.1% (95% confidence interval: 13.1% to 21.1%), even if significant between-center differences were found, with some institutions reporting 100% case fatality.
32336080,Exploratory inferential analysis showed no nominally statistically significant association between death and gender (p=0.788), but a significant association was found with age, mainly due to increased case fatality in subjects &gt;60 years (odds ratio: 4.80 [95% confidence interval 1.64 to 14.04], p=0.004).
32336080,ECMO may play an important role in critically ill patients with COVID-19 refractory to less invasive treatments.
32336080,The increased risk of early death in older patients may be used to prioritize ECMO indication in resource-conscious settings, if confirmed externally.
32336150,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a global impact on all aspects of health care, including surgical procedures.
32336150,For urologists, it has affected and will continue to influence how we approach the care of patients preoperatively, intraoperatively, and postoperatively.
32336150,A risk-benefit assessment of each patient undergoing surgery should be performed during the COVID-19 pandemic based on the urgency of the surgery and the risk of viral illness and transmission.
32336150,Patients with advanced age and comorbidities have a higher incidence of mortality.
32336150,Routine preoperative testing and symptom screening is recommended to identify those with COVID-19.
32336150,Adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) for the surgical team is essential to protect health care workers and ensure an adequate workforce.
32336150,For COVID-19 positive or suspected patients, the use of N95 respirators is recommended if available.
32336150,The anesthesia method chosen should attempt to minimize aerosolization of the virus.
32336150,Negative pressure rooms are strongly preferred for intubation/extubation and other aerosolizing procedures for COVID-19 positive patients or when COVID status is unknown.
32336150,Although transmission has not yet been shown during laparoscopic and robotic procedures, efforts should be made to minimize the risk of aerosolization.
32336150,Ultra-low particulate air filters are recommended for use during minimally invasive procedures to decrease the risk of viral transmission.
32336150,Thorough cleaning and sterilization should be performed postoperatively with adequate time allowed for the operating room air to be cycled after procedures.
32336150,COVID-19 patients should be separated from noninfected patients at all levels of care, including recovery, to decrease the risk of infection.
32336150,Future directions will be guided by outcomes and infection rates as social distancing guidelines are relaxed and more surgical procedures are reintroduced.
32336150,Recommendations should be adapted to the local environment and will continue to evolve as more data become available, the shortage of testing and PPE is resolved, and a vaccine and therapeutics for COVID-19 are developed.
32336317,The unexpected pandemic set off by the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) has caused severe panic among people worldwide.
32336317,COVID-19 has created havoc, and scientists and physicians are urged to test the efficiency and safety of drugs used to treat this disease.
32336317,In such a pandemic situation, various steps have been taken by the government to control and prevent the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV- 2).
32336317,This pandemic situation has forced scientists to rework strategies to combat infectious diseases through drugs, treatment, and control measures.
32336317,COVID-19 treatment requires both limiting viral multiplication and neutralizing tissue damage induced by an inappropriate immune reaction.
32336317,Currently, various diagnostic kits to test for COVID-19 are available, and repurposing therapeutics for COVID-19 has shown to be clinically effective.
32336317,As the global demand for diagnostics and therapeutics continues to rise, it is essential to rapidly develop various algorithms to successfully identify and contain the virus.
32336317,This review discusses the updates on specimens/samples, recent efficient diagnostics, and therapeutic approaches to control the disease and repurposed drugs mainly focusing on chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and convalescent plasma (CP).
32336317,More research is required for further understanding of the influence of diagnostics and therapeutic approaches to develop vaccines and drugs for COVID-19.
32336317,[BMB Reports 2020; 53(4): 191-205].
32336528,The COVID-19 epidemic has led to the need for unprecedented decisions to be made to maintain the provision of neurological care.
32336528,This article addresses operational decision-making during the epidemic.
32336528,We report the measures taken, including the preparation of a functional reorganisation plan, strategies for hospitalisation and emergency management, the use of telephone consultations to maintain neurological care, provision of care at a unit outside the hospital for priority patients, decisions about complementary testing and periodic in-hospital treatments, and the use of a specific telephone service to prioritise patients with epileptic seizures.
32336528,Despite the situation of confinement, neurology departments must continue to provide patient care through different means of operation.
32336528,Like all elements of management, these must be evaluated.
32336563,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory tract infection caused by a newly emergent coronavirus, that was first recognized in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.
32336563,Currently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has defined the infection as a global pandemic and there is a health and social emergency for the management of this new infection.
32336563,While most people with COVID-19 develop only mild or uncomplicated illness, approximately 14% develop severe disease that requires hospitalization and oxygen support, and 5% require admission to an intensive care unit.
32336563,In severe cases, COVID-19 can be complicated by the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and septic shock, and multiorgan failure.
32336563,This consensus document has been prepared on evidence-informed guidelines developed by a multidisciplinary panel of health care providers from four Spanish scientific societies (Spanish Society of Intensive Care Medicine [SEMICYUC], Spanish Society of Pulmonologists [SEPAR], Spanish Society of Emergency [SEMES], Spanish Society of Anesthesiology, Reanimation, and Pain [SEDAR]) with experience in the clinical management of patients with COVID-19 and other viral infections, including SARS, as well as sepsis and ARDS.
32336563,The document provides clinical recommendations for the noninvasive respiratory support (noninvasive ventilation, high flow oxygen therapy with nasal cannula) in any patient with suspected or confirmed presentation of COVID-19 with acute respiratory failure.
32336563,This consensus guidance should serve as a foundation for optimized supportive care to ensure the best possible chance for survival and to allow for reliable comparison of investigational therapeutic interventions as part of randomized controlled trials.
32336564,The great pulmonary affectation produced by the COVID-19 infection, requires a fast diagnostic tool that complements the diagnostic test by PCR and which is also useful in evaluating the progression of lung lesions.
32336564,Since most of these are peripheral, in this consensus document we propose the use of thoracic ultrasound for early diagnosis and for the daily evaluation of the progression of lung lesions by a single explorer without the need to use the chest CT.
32336564,In this consensus, it is proposed to carry out a systematic ultrasound examination of the thorax dividing it by quadrants and therefore identifying the ultrasound signs that are related to the type of parenchymal or pleural affectation that the patient has: A lines, B lines, parenchymal condensation, pleural line and pleural effusion.
32336564,These findings will facilitate the decision making regarding the patient management, both when deciding the place of admission of the patient and the type of treatment to be prescribed.
32336583,As shown by the current COVID-19 pandemic, emergency departments (ED) are the front line for hospital-and-community-based care during viral respiratory disease outbreaks.
32336583,As such, EDs must be able to reorganize and reformat operations to meet the changing needs and staggering patient volume.
32336583,This paper addresses ways to adapt departmental operations to better manage in times of elevated disease burden, specifically identifying areas of intervention to help limit crowding and spread.
32336583,Using experience from past outbreaks and the current COVID-19 pandemic, we advise strategies to increase surge capacity and limit patient inflow.
32336583,Triage should identify and geographically cohort symptomatic patients within a designated unit to limit exposure early in an outbreak.
32336583,Screening and PPE guidelines for both patient and staff should be followed closely, as determined by hospital administration and the CDC.
32336583,Equipment needs are also greatly affected in an outbreak; we emphasis portable radiographic equipment to limit transport, and an upstocking of certain medications, respiratory supplies, and PPE.
32336586,The COVID-19 pandemic has been particularly challenging due to a lack of established therapies and treatment guidelines.
32336586,With the rapid transmission of disease, even the off-label use of available therapies has been impeded by limited availability.
32336586,Several antivirals, antimalarials, and biologics are being considered for treatment at this time.
32336586,The purpose of this literature review is to synthesize the available information regarding treatment options for COVID-19 and serve as a resource for health care professionals.
32336586,This narrative review was conducted to summarize the effectiveness of current therapy options for COVID-19 and address the controversial use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs).
32336586,PubMed and SCOPUS were queried using a combination of the keywords &quot;COVID 19,&quot; &quot;SARS-CoV-2,&quot; and &quot;treatment.&quot; All types of studies were evaluated including systematic reviews, case-studies, and clinical guidelines.
32336586,There are currently no therapeutic drugs available that are directly active against SARS-CoV-2; however, several antivirals (remdesivir, favipiravir) and antimalarials (chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine) have emerged as potential therapies.
32336586,Current guidelines recommend combination treatment with hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin or chloroquine, if hydroxychloroquine is unavailable, in patients with moderate disease, although these recommendations are based on limited evidence.
32336586,Remdesivir and convalescent plasma may be considered in critical patients with respiratory failure; however, access to these therapies may be limited.
32336586,Interleukin-6 (IL-6) antagonists may be used in patients who develop evidence of cytokine release syndrome (CRS).
32336586,Corticosteroids should be avoided unless there is evidence of refractory septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or another compelling indication for their use.
32336586,ACE inhibitors and ARBs should not be discontinued at this time and ibuprofen may be used for fever.
32336586,There are several ongoing clinical trials that are testing the efficacy of single and combination treatments with the drugs mentioned in this review and new agents are under development.
32336586,Until the results of these trials become available, we must use the best available evidence for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.
32336586,Additionally, we can learn from the experiences of healthcare providers around the world to combat this pandemic.
32336594,A novel coronavirus, officially termed as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2, emerged in Wuhan, China, toward the end of 2019.
32336594,Just four months later, more than 100,000 people were diagnosed with COVID-19, the resulting disease.
32336594,The genetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 revealed that this virus is a new Betacoronavirus, closely related to bat-derived SARS-like coronaviruses.
32336594,Clinical data from hospitals in China have revealed that approximately 10% of the infected patients have severe disease requiring intensive care.
32336594,Since containment of the outbreak may have partially failed due to asymptomatic transmission, it is imperative to accelerate the development of rapid point-of-care diagnostic tests, vaccines, and therapeutics for the COVID-19 epidemic.
32336673,To describe the pharmacy administration and pharmaceutical care in a module hospital during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic and provide reference for domestic and foreign pharmacists participating in the epidemic prevention and control.
32336673,The study was performed in a Jianghan module hospital constructed at the Wuhan Convention and Exhibition Center in Wuhan, China.
32336673,This is 1 of the first 3 module hospitals.
32336673,One thousand eight hundred forty-eight patients were admitted to the Jianghan module hospital, and 1327 cases (71.81% of the total number) were cured and discharged.
32336673,Pharmacists have successfully completed the tasks of purchase, storage, and free distribution of drugs worth ¥1.03 million (approximately $146,000), reviewed about 20,000 electronic orders, provided one-on-one online medication consultation for 484 patients, and held 5 lectures on rational drug use knowledge, which could help reduce irrational drug use and minimize the risk involved.
32336673,The new COVID-19 &quot;module&quot; pharmaceutical care model is equipped with new features such as pharmacy emergency command group, organizational structure for pharmacy administration, electronic control of drug prescription, and &quot;zero contact&quot; pharmaceutical care relying on the new media platform &quot;WeChat.&quot; This platform provides relevant pharmaceutical care for patients, such as ensuring drug supply, setting up critical care drug trolleys, designing specific drug packaging bags, creating a module radio station to broadcast rational drug use information to the patients, and other aspects.
32336673,With the continuous improvement of the module hospital and the progress in in-depth knowledge about COVID-19, some aspects such as patient admission criteria and variety of drugs need to be adjusted depending on the actual situation.
32336673,The pharmacists provided pharmaceutical care for 1848 patients with mild COVID-19 disease.
32336673,They not only ensured the timely supply of the drugs but also reduced the incidence of drug-induced risks through medication review and guidance, thereby improving patient compliance and helping the patients rebuild their confidence in overcoming the disease.
32336673,The new COVID-19 module pharmaceutical care model has played an important role in overcoming the epidemic situation of COVID-19 in China and thus can be implemented on a broader scale.
32336723,The virus severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently affecting more than 200 countries and territories worldwide.
32336723,It has been declared as pandemic by World Health Organization (WHO) and the whole world is suffering from corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32336723,Currently, no treatment for SARS-CoV-2 are approved because of lack of evidence, but a number of clinical trials are in process and we are expecting fruitful results very soon.
32336723,This review focuses on various approaches of treatment and few of the most recent clinical trials carried out in this field.
32336927,In late December 2019, the world woke to a reality of a pandemic of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19), elicited by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which belongs to a group of β-coronavirus.
32336927,The potential to cause life-threatening respiratory failure and rapid transmission puts COVID-19 in the list of Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC).
32336927,In the last two decades, this is the 3<sup>rd</sup> deadliest Coronavirus pandemic, following SARS which lasted between 2002 and 2003 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) from 2012 till date.
32336927,Globally and as of April 1<sup>st</sup> 2020, COVID-19 has affected 924,688 individuals in over 200 countries, causing 46,368 fatalities.
32336927,While the SARS-CoV-2 originated in China with over 82,724 confirmed cases and more than 3000 deaths as at the time of writing this review, the rapid transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in exponential increase in the number of cases outside of China to about 10 times the report case and death in mainland China.
32336927,SARS-CoV-2 is suspected to be zoonotic in nature as genetic studies have shown sequence similarity to viruses originating from bats.
32336927,Extreme precautionary measures, such as curfew, shutting of borders and quarantining of individuals suspected to be infected have been instituted with immediate effect; however, due to individuals that are asymptomatic, uncontrolled human-to-human transmission has resulted in exponential infection rate and numerous loss of lives even with this lockdown measures.
32336927,This review article summarizes the developing situation surrounding the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic with respect to its epidemiology, unique genomic structure, possible origins, transmission, pathogenesis, comparison with other deadly species of Coronaviruses (CoV) and emerging treatment strategies built on informed literature.
32336959,The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to spread across the globe, and millions of people may be affected.
32336959,While knowledge regarding epidemiologic features and diagnostic tools of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rapidly evolving, uncertainties surrounding various aspects of its optimal management strategies persist.
32336959,A subset of these patients develop a more severe form of the disease characterized by expanding pulmonary lesions, sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and respiratory failure.
32336959,Due to lack of data on treatment strategies specific to this subset of patients, currently available evidence on management of the critically ill needs to be extrapolated and customized to their clinical needs.
32336959,The article calls attention to fluid stewardship in the critically ill with COVID-19 by judiciously applying the evidence-based resuscitation principles to their specific clinical features such as high rates of cardiac injury.
32336959,As we await more data from treating these patients, this strategy is likely to help reduce potential complications.
32337113,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the virus responsible for the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19).
32337113,First identified in Wuhan (Hubei, China) in December of 2019, it has since been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March of 2020.
32337113,In this study, we will provide a brief review of viral origin, identification, symptoms, transmission, diagnosis, and potential treatment strategies for the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 strain.
32337139,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32337139,First reported at the end of December 2019 as a cause for clusters of pneumonia cases in Wuhan city in China, the rapid spread of this condition was declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020, by the World Health Organization (WHO).
32337139,Apart from the mortality and morbidity associated with COVID-19, the massive social and financial havoc inflicted by this pandemic has left the entire world pondering if medical science can innovate and curtail the ongoing damage due to SARS-CoV-2.
32337139,Recent findings of an open-label study that investigated the use of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin in COVID-19 patients in Marseille, France, has garnered some optimism in scientific quarters and the general public alike in terms of finding a treatment regimen to control the rampant rise of COVID-19.
32337139,We will discuss the potential off-label therapy and studies as it pertains to COVID-19.
32337143,Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the family of Coronaviridae, the order Nidovirales, and the genus Coronavirus.
32337143,They are the largest group of viruses causing respiratory and gastrointestinal infections.
32337143,Morphologically, CoVs are enveloped viruses containing a non-segmented positive-sense, single-stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses.
32337143,CoVs are categorized into four important genera that include Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus.
32337143,A novel member of human CoV that has recently emerged in Wuhan, China, is now formally named as SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2).
32337143,This is a unique strain of RNA viruses that have not been previously observed in humans.
32337143,The virus has wide host adaptability and is capable of causing severe diseases in humans, masked palm civets, mice, dogs, cats, camels, pigs, chickens, and bats.
32337143,The SARS-CoV-2 typically causes respiratory and gastrointestinal sickness in both humans and animals.
32337143,It can be transmitted through aerosols and direct/indirect contact, as well as during medical cases and laboratory sample handling.
32337143,Specific structural proteins, which might be found on the surface of the virus, play an important role in the pathogenesis and development of the complications.
32337143,The disease is characterized by distinct medical signs and symptoms that include high fever, chills, cough, and shortness of breath or difficulty in breathing.
32337143,The infected people may also present with other symptoms such as diarrhea, myalgia, fatigue, expectoration, and hemoptysis.
32337143,It is important from the public health and economic point of view as it affects the growth of the country, which is majorly attributed to the restriction in the movement of the people and the cost associated with the control and prevention of the disease.
32337143,Since there is no specific therapeutic intervention nor a vaccine available against the virus, supportive management and treatment with non-specific therapeutic agents (repurposed drugs) may provide relief to the patients.
32337143,Some preventive strategies of the disease include blocking the routes of transmission of the infections, disinfection of instruments used during medical case handling, using personal protective equipment, proper and early diagnosis of the disease, avoiding contact with the sick patients, and quarantine of the infected/exposed people.
32337148,Patients with Covid-19 disease commonly present with symptoms related to respiratory illness, and less commonly they develop cardiovascular complications either on presentation or during the course of the disease.
32337148,The mortality/morbidity is high in these patients with cardiovascular involvement.
32337148,Acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is a medical emergency which needs immediate coronary re-perfusion for better patient outcomes.
32337148,Here we present a patient who presented to the emergency room with acute STEMI and later tested positive for COVID-19.
32337148,She was successfully treated with coronary revascularization and stent placement, and remains on the ventilator to date as she quickly developed acute respiratory distress syndrome.
32337148,We need more research in Covid-19 patients with cardiovascular involvement for early diagnosis, prevention of exposure to health care workers and effective treatment.
32337192,Global health authorities are trying to work out the current status of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak and explore methods to reduce the rate of its transmission to healthy individuals.
32337192,In this viewpoint we provide insights concerning how health care professionals can unintentionally shift the novel coronavirus type to more drug-resistant forms.
32337192,It is worth noting that viruses usually have different sensitivities to physical and chemical damaging agents such antiviral drugs, UV and heat ranging from extremely sensitive (ES) to extremely resistant (ER) based on a bell-shaped curve.
32337192,Given this consideration, the widespread infection of people with such ER viruses would be a real disaster.
32337192,Here, we introduce a modified treatment method for COVID-19-associated pneumonia.
32337192,In this proposed method, COVID-19 patients will receive a single dose of 100, 180 or 250 mSv X-ray radiation that is less than the maximum annual radiation dose of the residents of high background radiation areas of Ramsar that is up to 260 mSv.
32337192,In contrast with antiviral drugs, a single dose of either 100, 180 or 250 mSv of low LET X-rays cannot exert a significant selective pressure on the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and hence does not lead to directed accelerated evolution of these viruses.
32337192,Moreover, Low Dose Radiation (LDR) has the capacity of modulating excessive inflammatory responses, regulating lymphocyte counts, and controling bacterial co-infections in patients with COVID-19.
32337201,The first case of pneumonia subsequently attributed to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province on December 8, 2019.
32337201,The symptoms included fever, coughing, and breathing difficulties.
32337201,A few patients with this infection may only have atypical symptoms, which could lead to a misdiagnosis and subsequently further facilitate the spread of the virus.
32337201,A 74-year-old female patient complained of severe diarrhea.
32337201,She did not have fever, coughing, or breathing difficulties.
32337201,A physical examination revealed no obvious positive signs.
32337201,The patient had been hypertensive for more than 10 years.
32337201,Her blood pressure was well controlled.
32337201,On January 9, 2020, the patient's son visited a colleague who was later confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 and his first close contact with our patient was on January 17.
32337201,The patient was first diagnosed with gastrointestinal dysfunction.
32337201,However, considering her indirect contact with a SARS-CoV-2-infected individual, we suggested that an atypical pneumonia virus infection should be ruled out.
32337201,A computed tomography scan was performed on January 26, and showed ground-glass nodules scattered along the two lungs, suggestive of viral pneumonia.
32337201,Given the clinical characteristics, epidemiological history, and examination, the patient was diagnosed with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19).
32337201,Our patient had atypical symptoms of COVID-19.
32337201,Careful acquisition of an epidemiological history is necessary to make a correct diagnosis and strategize a treatment plan.
32337328,This work shows a patent database for <i>Coronaviruses</i> that provides an overview of the patenting activity and trends in focused antiviral therapy with the use of triazole based compounds, glycoprotein, and protease inhibitors as possible treatment.
32337328,The patent data was obtained from Orbit Intelligence Software using a patent family structure to get a big database that could be used for built patent landscape report (PLR), market analysis, technical and competitive intelligence, and monitoring and survey of a new ideas for the treatment of coronavirus diseases.
32337328,The raw data is reported in four databases, which were classified according to different items: legal status (alive, dead), 1<sup>st</sup> application year (after 2015, 2011-2015, 2006-2010, 2001-2005), and Top 5 International Patents Classifications (IPC).
32337328,The main players, the investment trend, markets, geographical distribution, technology overview, technologies distribution, and patent citation are showed by this analysed data report.
32337386,Uveal melanoma (UM) is a rare but life-threatening cancer of the eye.
32337386,In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, hospitals and proton eye therapy facilities must analyze several factors to ensure appropriate treatment protocols for patients and provider teams.
32337386,Practice considerations to limit COVID-19 transmission in the proton ocular treatment setting for UM are necessary.
32337386,The Particle Therapy Co-Operative Group (PTCOG) is the largest international community of particle/proton therapy providers.
32337386,Participating experts are/were affiliated with the member institutions of the PTCOG Ocular subcommittee with long-standing high-volume proton ocular programs.
32337386,The practices reviewed in this document must be taken in conjunction with local hospital procedures, multidisciplinary recommendations, and regional/national guidelines, as each community may have its unique needs, supplies, and protocols.
32337386,Importantly, as the pandemic evolves, so will the strategies and recommendations.
32337386,Given the unique circumstances for UM patients, along with indications of potential ophthalmologic transmission as a result of healthcare providers working in close proximity to patients and intrinsic infectious risk from eyelashes, tears and hair, practice strategies may be adapted to reduce the risk of viral transmission.
32337386,Certainly, providers and health care systems will continue to examine and provide as safe and effective care as possible for patients in the current environment.
32337664,Since December 2019, a novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) has broken out in Wuhan, China and spread rapidly.
32337664,Recent studies have found that ⁓ 15.7% of patients develop severe pneumonia, and cytokine storm is an important factor leading to rapid disease progression.
32337664,Currently, there are no specific drugs for COVID-19 and the cytokine storm it causes.
32337664,IL-6 is one of the key cytokines involved in infection-induced cytokine storm.
32337664,Tocilizumab, which is the IL-6 receptor antagonist, has been approved by the US FDA for the treatment of cytokine release syndrome (CRS), is expected to treat cytokine storm caused by COVID-19 and is now in clinical trials.
32337664,In this paper, we will elaborate the role of cytokine storm in COVID-19, the mechanism of tocilizumab on cytokine storm and the key points of pharmaceutical care based on the actual clinical application for COVID-19 in our hospital, the latest research reports, clinical trial progress of tocilizumab, drug instruction from the US FDA, and &quot;Diagnosis and Treatment Plan of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (seventh trial edition)&quot; in China, so as to provide reference for the treatment of COVID-19.
32337769,Successful treatment of viral infections has proven to be huge challenge for modern medicine with the most effective approach being prior vaccination.
32337769,The problem with vaccination is the time it takes to develop an effective vaccine, validate its safety and manufacture it in large quantities.
32337769,Facing Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), we simply do not have the time to develop the vaccine before thousands of people die.
32337769,Therefore, any treatment which can decrease the severe symptoms due to lung damage may help attenuate mortality rates.
32337769,Inactivation of ACE2 during virus fusion into the host cell may be one of the underlying reasons for intense immunological reaction seen in the lung tissue.
32337769,This overreaction is probably mediated through the bradykinin receptor activation.
32337769,Noscapine, a medication used for the treatment of cough, has been shown to inhibit bradykinin enhanced cough response in man.
32337769,As it is already marketed in a number of countries as a cough medicine, even for children, a suitable formulation with all the required licenses is available that can be rapidly utilized in preliminary trials.
32337790,The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic requires extra attention for immunocompromised patients, including solid organ transplant recipients.
32337790,We report on a case of a 35-year-old renal transplant recipient who suffered from a severe COVID-19 pneumonia.
32337790,The clinical course was complicated by extreme overexposure to the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor everolimus, following coadministration of chloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir therapy.
32337790,The case is illustrative for dilemmas that transplant professionals may face in the absence of evidence-based COVID-19 therapy and concurrent pressure for exploration of experimental pharmacological treatment options.
32337790,However, the risk-benefit balance of experimental or off-label therapy may be weighed differently in organ transplant recipients than in otherwise healthy COVID-19 patients, owing to their immunocompromised status and potential drug interactions with immunosuppressive therapy.
32337790,With this case report, we aimed to achieve increased awareness and improved management of drug-drug interactions associated with the various treatment options for COVID-19 in renal transplant patients.
32338155,The current pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) calls urgently for effective therapies.
32338155,Anti-malarial medicine chloroquine (CQ) and particularly its chemical analogue hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have been recommended as promising candidate therapeutics that are now under either compassionate off-label use or clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.
32338155,However, there are public concerns and disputes about both the safety and efficacy of CQ and HCQ for this new application.
32338155,Given the fact that for decades HCQ has been approved as an immunomodulatory drug for the long term treatment of chronic rheumatic diseases, as experienced rheumatologists, we would like to share our thoughts in this regard and trigger a brainstorm among clinical care providers for exchanging their diverse opinions on this urgent topic.
32338164,New treatment against SARS-CoV-2 now is a must.
32338164,Nowadays, the world encounters a huge health crisis by the COVID-19 viral infection.
32338164,Nucleotide inhibitors gave a lot of promising results in terms of its efficacy against different viral infections.
32338164,In this work, molecular modeling, docking, and dynamics simulations are used to build a model for the viral protein RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and test its binding affinity to some clinically approved drugs and drug candidates.
32338164,Molecular dynamics is used to equilibrate the system upon binding calculations to ensure the successful reproduction of previous results, to include the dynamics of the RdRp, and to understand how it affects the binding.
32338164,The results show the effectiveness of Sofosbuvir, Ribavirin, Galidesivir, Remdesivir, Favipiravir, Cefuroxime, Tenofovir, and Hydroxychloroquine, in binding to SARS-CoV-2 RdRp.
32338164,Additionally, Setrobuvir, YAK, and IDX-184, show better results, while four novel IDX-184 derivatives show promising results in attaching to the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp.
32338164,There is an urgent need to specify drugs that can selectively bind and subsequently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 proteins.
32338164,The availability of a punch of FDA-approved anti-viral drugs can help us in this mission, aiming to reduce the danger of COVID-19.
32338164,The compounds 2 and 3 may tightly bind to the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and so may be successful in the treatment of COVID-19.
32338224,Coronaviruses (CoVs) possess an enveloped, single, positive-stranded RNA genome which encodes for four membrane proteins, namely spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins 3-5 [1].
32338224,With regard to pathogenicity, S proteins are essential for viral entry into host cells [2, 3].
32338224,SARS-CoV binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)2 which is present on nonimmune cells, such as respiratory and intestinal epithelial cells, endothelial cells, kidney cells (renal tubules) and cerebral neurons and immune cells, such as alveolar monocytes/macrophages [4-6].
32338224,Of note, CD209L or liver/lymph node special intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin (SIGN) and dendritic cell (DC)-SIGN are alternative receptors for SARS-CoV but with lower affinity [7].
32338224,In the case of MERS-CoV, S proteins bind to the host cell receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4 or CD26) which is broadly expressed on intestinal, alveolar, renal, hepatic and prostate cells as well as on activated leukocytes [8].
32338224,Then, viruses replicate in target cells with release of mature virions, which, in turn, invade new target cells [9].
32338224,Evidence has been provided that SARSCoV proteins are cleaved into two subunits, S1 and S2, respectively, and the amino acids 318-510 of the S1 represent the receptor-binding domain (RBD) which binds to ACE2 [10, 11].
32338224,Quite importantly, in the context of RBD there is the receptor-binding motif (RBM) (amino acids 424- 494), which accounts for complete binding to ACE2 [11].
32338224,Moreover, by means of two residues at positions 479 and 487 RBD allows virus progression and tropism [10, 11].
32338224,In the case of MERSCoV, its RBM binds to DPP4 with residues 484-567, thus, suggesting that its RBD differs from that of SARS-CoV [12, 13].
32338224,In a very recent paper, Wan and associates [14] have investigated the receptor recognition by COVID-19 (a new term to indicate the 2019-nCoV in Wuhan) on the bases of structural studies.
32338224,In this respect, the sequence of COVID-19 RBM is similar to that of SARSCoV, thus, implicating that ACE2 may represent the binding receptors for COVID-19.
32338224,Furthermore, gln493 residue of COVID-19 RBM seems to allow interaction with human ACE2, thus, suggesting the ability of this virus to infect human cells.
32338224,According, to Wan and associates structural analysis [14], COVID-19 binds to human ACE2 with a lesser efficiency than human SARS-CoV (2002) but with higher affinity than human SARS-CoV (2003).
32338224,Furthermore, same authors predicted that a single mutation at the 501 position may enhance the COVID-19 RBD binding capacity to human ACE2 and this evolution should be monitored in infected patients [14].
32338224,These predictive findings by Wan and associates [14] are confirmed by two contemporary studies by Letko and Muster [15] and Peng and associates [16].
32338224,In particular, the report by Peng and associates [16], points out the possible origin of COVID-19 from bats [16].
32338224,From a pathogenic point of view, evidence has been provided that binding of S2 to ACE2 receptor leads to its down-regulation with subsequent lung damage in the course of SARS-CoV infection [17].
32338224,Down-regulation of ACE2 causes excessive production of angiotensin (ANG) II by the related enzyme ACE with stimulation of ANG type 1a receptor (AT1R) and enhanced lung vascular permeability [18].
32338224,In particular, same authors have reported that recombinant ACE2 could attenuate severe acute lung injury in mice [18].
32338224,Moreover, Battle and associates [19] also proposed to use already available recombinant ACE2 for intercepting COVID-19 and attenuating infection.
32338224,In the previous paragraphs, the presence of ACE2 on immune cells has been pointed out and, by analogy to epithelial cells, this receptor may also be down-regulated following viral entry.
32338224,Therefore, in CoV-infected animal models and in infected humans further investigations are required to clarify a possible reduced expression of ACE2 on immune cells.
32338224,In fact, in the course of SARS-CoV infection, a number of immune disorders have been detected.
32338224,Three reports have demonstrated the ability of CoV to inhibit interferon (IFN)- production in the course of SARS acting as IFN antagonist [20-22].
32338224,In senescent Balb/c mice, depletion of T lymphocytes is associated to more severe interstitial pneumonitis and delayed clearance of SARS-CoV, thus, suggesting a protective role played by these cells [23].
32338224,In this connection, both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have been shown to induce T cell apoptosis, thus, aggravating the clinical course of disease [24, 25].
32338224,Quite interestingly, memory CD8+ T cells specific for SARS-CoV M and N proteins have been detected up to 11 years post-infection [26].
32338224,As far as humoral immune responsiveness is concerned, evidence has been provided that S1 subunit from MERS-CoV is highly immunogenic in mice [27].
32338224,Moreover, monoclonal antibodies have been shown to be highly neutralizing against MERS-CoV replication and endowed with post exposure effectiveness in susceptible mice [28, 29].
32338224,Human neutralizing antibodies have also been isolated from a recovered patient, thus, suggesting the role of humoral immunity in the control of the persistence of CoV in the host [30].
32338224,In particular, IgG response occurs early in infection and its prolonged production may serve for virus clearance during recovery also in view of the absence of viremia in convalescent sera from SARS patients [31].
32338224,According to current literature, severity of COVID-19 infection correlates with lymphopenia and patients who died from COVID-19 had lower lymphocyte counts when compared to survivors [32, 33].
32338224,These data suggest that lymphocyte-mediated anti-viral activity is poorly effective against COVID-19.
32338224,Despite lymphopenia, evidence for an exaggerate release of proinflammatory cytokines [interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6] has been reported in the course acute respiratory syndrome in COVID19 infected patients, thus, aggravating the clinical course of disease [34].
32338224,As recently reported, during COVID-19 pandemic in both Italy and China higher frequency of fatalities have been observed in the frail elderly population with previous comorbidities [35].
32338224,It is well known that decline of immunity occurs in ageing and, therefore, COVID-19 may gain easier access to the respiratory tract in frail elderly patients [36].
32338224,There is evidence that ACE2 protects from severe acute lung failure and operates as a negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) [18, 37].
32338224,It is well known that ANG II via activation of the AT1R promotes detrimental effects on the host, such as, vasoconstriction, reactive oxygen species generation, inflammation and matrix remodelling [38].
32338224,ACE2 counterbalances the noxious effects exhibited by ANG II and AT1R via activation of AT2R which arrests cell growth, inflammation and fibrosis [39].
32338224,In this framework, Gurwitz [40] proposed to use AT1R blockers, such as losartan, as a potential treatment of COVID-19 infection.
32338224,In fact, losartan as well as olmesartan, used for treating hypertension in patients, were able to increase ACE2 expression after 28 days treatment of rats with myocardial infarction [41].
32338224,Then, Gurwitz suggests to evaluate severity of symptoms in COVID-19 infected patients under previous chronic treatment with AT1R blockers in comparison to COVID-19 infected patients who did not take AT1R blockers [40].
32338224,Quite interestingly, 75% of aged COVID-19 infected patients admitted to Italian hospitals had hypertension [unpublished data].
32338224,However, the putative effects of ACE-2 down-regulation on the cardiovascular system in the course of COVID-19 pandemic need more intensive studies.
32338224,Taken together, these evidences suggest that CoV-induced down-regulation of ACE2 activates RAS with collateral damage to organs, such as lungs, in the course of SARS-related pneumonia.
32338224,Then, putative therapeutic measures aimed at increasing ACE2 levels on respiratory epithelial cells should be taken into serious consideration.
32338224,Quite interestingly, over the past few years, three key papers have demonstrated the ability of a polyphenol, resveratrol (RES), to experimentally deactivate the RAS system in maternal and post-weaning high fat diet, arterial ageing and high fat diet, respectively [42-44].
32338224,In all these experimental models, RES led to an increase of ACE2 with reduction of organ damage, such as liver steatosis and aorta media thickness and decrease of adipose tissue mass, respectively.
32338224,As far as the mechanism of action of RES is concerned, this polyphenol is able to activate sirtuin (Sirt)1 [45-47].
32338224,In turn, Sirt1 down-regulates AT1R expression via ACE2 up-regulation [43, 48].
32338224,Of importance, Lin and associates [48] have demonstrated the ability of RES to in vitro inhibit MERS-CoV infection of Vero E6 cells, thus, prolonging cell survival in virtue of an anti-apoptotic mechanism.
32338224,These findings suggest a direct antiviral effect exerted by RES.
32338224,It would be very interestingly to evaluate the direct effects of RES on COVID-19, in vitro.
32338224,The data above discussed strongly suggest, that RES, as an activators of ACE2, should be investigated in animal models of CoV-induced severe pneumonia, also taking into account the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating effects exerted by polyphenols [49].
32338224,Then, successful animal studies may pave the way for RES-based human trials in COVID-infected patients.
32338224,Note added in proof During the reviewing process of this perspective other related papers have been published.
32338224,Hanff and associates [50] have discussed the possible association between COVID-19-associated cardiovascular mortality and dysregulation of the Renin Angiotensin System (RAS).
32338224,From a pharmacologic point of view, RAS inhibition leads to upregulation of ACE2, thus, attenuating acute respiratory syndrome and myocarditis in COVID-19-infected patients.
32338224,Conversely, increase in ACE2 expression may facilitate the access into the host of COVID-19, thus, aggravating the clinical picture.
32338224,Such a dilemma would be solved by clinical trials based on RAS blockade or initiation and monitoring related effects.
32338224,Contemporarily, Danser and associates [51] claim that there is no evidence to stop RAS blockers in the course of COVID-19 infection.
32338224,In fact, there are no available data which support that ACE inhibitors or ANG II type I receptor blockers increase COVID-19 infection via its binding to ACE2.
32338224,Finally, Kuster and associates [52] write that there are no data on the strict relationship between ACE2 activity and SARS-CoV2 mortality.
32338224,Moreover, in the SARSCoV2, cells expressing ACE2 were not attacked by the virus, while cells lacking ACE2 were bound by the SARS-CoV2 virus [53].
32338224,These findings suggest that also in the case of RES effects on COVID-19 infection, the dual role of ACE2 should be taken into serious consideration.
32338298,The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has resulted in new challenges for clinicians, head and neck cancer (HNC) patients and carers.
32338298,There is evidence that the current crisis is affecting the management of HNC patients.
32338298,Most healthcare systems have introduced remote consultations to decrease the risk of coronavirus infection to patients, carers and clinicians.
32338298,At present, HNC patients may be anxious and due to logistical issues, may not be adequately prepared for their treatment.
32338298,To ensure that patients have a thorough understanding of their treatment and expected outcome during the current COVID-19 crisis there may be merit in the use of the HaNC-AD PCI.
32338708,There are many pharmacologic therapies that are being used or considered for treatment of COVID-19.
32338708,There is a need for frequently updated practice guidelines on their use, based on critical evaluation of rapidly emerging literature.
32338708,Develop evidence-based rapid guidelines intended to support patients, clinicians and other health-care professionals in their decisions about treatment and management of patients with COVID-19.
32338708,IDSA formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel of infectious disease clinicians, pharmacists, and methodologists with varied areas of expertise.
32338708,Process followed a rapid recommendation checklist.
32338708,The panel prioritized questions and outcomes.
32338708,Then a systematic review of the peer-reviewed and grey literature was conducted.
32338708,The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess the certainty of evidence and make recommendations.
32338708,The IDSA guideline panel agreed on 7 treatment recommendations and provided narrative summaries of other treatments undergoing evaluations.
32338708,The panel expressed the overarching goal that patients be recruited into ongoing trials, which would provide much needed evidence on the efficacy and safety of various therapies for COVID-19, given that we could not make a determination whether the benefits outweigh harms for most treatments.
32338790,The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has created significant challenges to the delivery of care for patients with advanced head and neck cancer requiring multimodality therapy.
32338790,Performing major head and neck ablative surgery and reconstruction is a particular concern given the extended duration and aerosolizing nature of these cases.
32338790,In this manuscript, we describe our surgical approach to provide timely reconstructive care and minimize infectious risk to the providers, patients, and families.
32338809,Health care services are being confronted by a daily dilemma of who can receive critical care and who cannot.
32338809,In a palliative care clinic, this apprehension gets exemplified, as these patients have limited life expectancy.
32338809,The head and neck region further makes things critical, as it comprises of all the sites through which the SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted.
32338809,This document strives to define the ways in which the head and neck cancer services can contribute to better patient care in a triage context.
32338809,Practical steps suggested are protective equipment use, ensuring access to critical drugs (such as opioids), greater use of telemedicine consultations, discussing advance care plans, and embracing the role of a wider community support.
32339025,The COVID-19 pandemic has strained global health care systems in ways that simply could not have been imagined just several months ago.
32339025,Writing from the heart of New York City - the unfortunate new epicenter of this pandemic - we have been confronted with this new reality head-on.
32339025,As directors of two major academic cardiac catheterization laboratories in the city, we both have had to operationalize logistical planning of physician and staff redeployments as well as modification of our respective hospital units including conversion of large portions of the catheterization laboratory into COVID-19 intensive care units in order to deal with the surge of COVID-19 patients within the hospital.
32339235,During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, contact with the healthcare system for cancer treatment can increase risk of infection and associated mortality.
32339235,Treatment recommendations must consider this risk for elderly and vulnerable cancer patients.
32339235,We re-analyzed trials in elderly glioblastoma (GBM) patients, incorporating COVID-19 risk, in order to provide a quantitative framework for comparing different radiation (RT) fractionation schedules on patient outcomes.
32339235,We extracted individual patient-level data (IPLD) for 1,321 patients from Kaplan-Meier curves from five randomized trials on treatment of elderly GBM patients including available subanalyses based on MGMT methylation status.
32339235,We simulated trial data with incorporation of COVID-19 associated mortality risk in several scenarios (low, medium, and high infection and mortality risks).
32339235,Median overall survival and hazard ratios were calculated for each simulation replicate.
32339235,Our simulations reveal how COVID-19-associated risks affect survival under different treatment regimens.
32339235,Hypofractionated RT with concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ) demonstrated the best outcomes in low and medium risk scenarios.
32339235,In frail elderly patients, shorter courses of RT are preferable.
32339235,In patients with methylated MGMT receiving single modality treatment, TMZ-alone treatment approaches may be an option in settings with high COVID-19-associated risk.
32339235,Incorporation of COVID-19-associated risk models into analysis of randomized trials can help guide clinical decisions during this pandemic.
32339235,In elderly GBM patients, our results support prioritization of hypofractionated RT and highlight the utility of MGMT methylation status in decision-making in pandemic scenarios.
32339235,Our quantitative framework can serve as a model for assessing COVID-19 risk associated with treatment across neuro-oncology.
32339248,There is no specific antiviral therapy recommended for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32339248,In vitro studies indicate that the antiviral effect of chloroquine diphosphate (CQ) requires a high concentration of the drug.
32339248,To evaluate the safety and efficacy of 2 CQ dosages in patients with severe COVID-19.
32339248,This parallel, double-masked, randomized, phase IIb clinical trial with 81 adult patients who were hospitalized with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was conducted from March 23 to April 5, 2020, at a tertiary care facility in Manaus, Brazilian Amazon.
32339248,Patients were allocated to receive high-dosage CQ (ie, 600 mg CQ twice daily for 10 days) or low-dosage CQ (ie, 450 mg twice daily on day 1 and once daily for 4 days).
32339248,Primary outcome was reduction in lethality by at least 50% in the high-dosage group compared with the low-dosage group.
32339248,Data presented here refer primarily to safety and lethality outcomes during treatment on day 13.
32339248,Secondary end points included participant clinical status, laboratory examinations, and electrocardiogram results.
32339248,Outcomes will be presented to day 28.
32339248,Viral respiratory secretion RNA detection was performed on days 0 and 4.
32339248,Out of a predefined sample size of 440 patients, 81 were enrolled (41 [50.6%] to high-dosage group and 40 [49.4%] to low-dosage group).
32339248,Enrolled patients had a mean (SD) age of 51.1 (13.9) years, and most (60 [75.3%]) were men.
32339248,Older age (mean [SD] age, 54.7 [13.7] years vs 47.4 [13.3] years) and more heart disease (5 of 28 [17.9%] vs 0) were seen in the high-dose group.
32339248,Viral RNA was detected in 31 of 40 (77.5%) and 31 of 41 (75.6%) patients in the low-dosage and high-dosage groups, respectively.
32339248,Lethality until day 13 was 39.0% in the high-dosage group (16 of 41) and 15.0% in the low-dosage group (6 of 40).
32339248,The high-dosage group presented more instance of QTc interval greater than 500 milliseconds (7 of 37 [18.9%]) compared with the low-dosage group (4 of 36 [11.1%]).
32339248,Respiratory secretion at day 4 was negative in only 6 of 27 patients (22.2%).
32339248,The preliminary findings of this study suggest that the higher CQ dosage should not be recommended for critically ill patients with COVID-19 because of its potential safety hazards, especially when taken concurrently with azithromycin and oseltamivir.
32339248,These findings cannot be extrapolated to patients with nonsevere COVID-19.
32339248,ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04323527.
32339250,The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak began in the city of Wuhan, whereupon it rapidly spread throughout China and subsequently across the world.
32339250,Rapid transmission of COVID-19 has caused wide-spread panic.
32339250,Many established medications have been used to treat the disease symptoms; however, no specific drugs or vaccines have been developed.
32339250,Organoids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) may serve as suitable infection models for ex vivo mimicking of the viral life cycle and drug screening.
32339250,Human iPSC-3D organoids, self-organised tissues with multiple cell environments, have a similar structure and function as real human organs; hence, these organoids allow greater viral infection efficiency, mimic the natural host-virus interactions, and are suitable for long-term experimentation.
32339250,Here, we suggest the use of a functional human iPSC-organoid that could act as a reliable and feasible ex vivo infection model for investigation of the virus.
32339250,This approach will provide much needed insight into the underlying molecular dynamics of COVID-19 for the development of novel treatment and prevention strategies.
32339260,As COVID-19 disease escalates globally, optimising patient outcome during this catastrophic healthcare crisis is the number one priority.
32339260,The principles of patient blood management are fundamental strategies to improve patient outcomes and should be given high priority in this crisis situation.
32339260,The aim of this expert review is to provide clinicians and healthcare authorities with information regarding how to apply established principles of patient blood management during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32339260,In particular, this review considers the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on blood supply and specifies important aspects of donor management.
32339260,We discuss how preventative and control measures implemented during the COVID-19 crisis could affect the prevalence of anaemia, and highlight issues regarding the diagnosis and treatment of anaemia in patients requiring elective or emergency surgery.
32339260,In addition, we review aspects related to patient blood management of critically ill patients with known or suspected COVID-19, and discuss important alterations of the coagulation system in patients hospitalised due to COVID-19.
32339260,Finally, we address special considerations pertaining to supply-demand and cost-benefit issues of patient blood management during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32339304,Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV-2) has become a global health care crisis.
32339304,The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists immunocompromised patients, including those requiring immunosuppression following renal transplantation, as high risk for severe disease from SARS-CoV-2.
32339304,Treatment for other viral infections in renal transplant recipients often includes a reduction in immunosuppression; however, no current guidelines are available recommending the optimal approach to managing immunosuppression in the patients who are infected with SARS-CoV-2.
32339304,It is currently advised to avoid corticosteroids in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 outside of critically ill patients.
32339304,Recently published cases describing inpatient care of COVID-19 in renal transplant recipients differ widely in disease severity, time from transplantation, baseline immunosuppressive therapy, and the modifications made to immunosuppression during COVID-19 treatment.
32339304,This review summarizes and compares inpatient immunosuppressant management strategies of recently published reports in the renal transplant population infected with SARS-CoV-2 and discusses the limitations of corticosteroids in managing immunosuppression in this patient population.
32339340,The Italian National Health System is currently living through some catastrophic days, owing to the rapid spread of COVID-19 across the country.
32339340,At the time of writing, our Government has passed emergency laws (March 11, 2020), with a view to preventing widespread viral infection among the population, which may well lead to an increase in the number of people requiring intensive care unit (ICU) hospital treatment.
32339340,Currently, most of the northern Italian regions are close to saturation point in terms of the number of available ICU inpatient beds.
32339382,To report mode of delivery and immediate neonatal outcome in women infected with COVID-19.
32339382,Retrospective study.
32339382,Twelve hospitals in northern Italy.
32339382,Pregnant women with COVID-19-confirmed infection who delivered.
32339382,COVID 19 infection in pregnancy.
32339382,SARS-CoV-2-infected women who were admitted and delivered from 1 to 20 March 2020 were eligible.
32339382,Data were collected from the clinical records using a standardised questionnaire on maternal general characteristics, any medical or obstetric co-morbidity, course of pregnancy, clinical signs and symptoms, treatment of COVID 19 infection, mode of delivery, neonatal data and breastfeeding.
32339382,Data on mode of delivery and neonatal outcome.
32339382,In all, 42 women with COVID-19 delivered at the participating centres; 24 (57.1%, 95% CI 41.0-72.3) delivered vaginally.
32339382,An elective caesarean section was performed in 18/42 (42.9%, 95% CI 27.7-59.0) cases: in eight cases the indication was unrelated to COVID-19 infection.
32339382,Pneumonia was diagnosed in 19/42 (45.2%, 95% CI 29.8-61.3) cases: of these, 7/19 (36.8%, 95% CI 16.3-61.6) required oxygen support and 4/19 (21.1%, 95% CI 6.1-45.6) were admitted to a critical care unit.
32339382,Two women with COVID-19 breastfed without a mask because infection was diagnosed in the postpartum period: their newborns tested positive for SARS-Cov-2 infection.
32339382,In one case, a newborn had a positive test after a vaginal operative delivery.
32339382,Although postpartum infection cannot be excluded with 100% certainty, these findings suggest that vaginal delivery is associated with a low risk of intrapartum SARS-Cov-2 transmission to the newborn.
32339382,This study suggests that vaginal delivery may be associated with a low risk of intrapartum SARS-Cov-2 transmission to the newborn.
32339394,With the COVID-19 pandemic, clinicians and researchers have been suddenly confronted with the difficulty of treatment provision and continuation of clinical trials without face-to-face contact.
32339394,This predicament has resulted in the rapid adoption of telehealth methodologies.<sup>1</sup> Clinicians and researchers focused on obesity management have an additional need-- a remote way to measure weight.
32339394,In this piece, we will describe electronic scales (e-scales) and provide guidance on how clinicians/researchers might best implement e-scales in their clinical practice or research studies to remotely measure weight.
32339662,The full impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), on the field of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is unknown.
32339662,This perspective paper reviews the following: current COVID-19 epidemiology, diagnosis, and potential therapies; care considerations unique to HCT recipients; and the concept of a learning network to assimilate emerging guidelines and best practices and to optimize patient outcomes through facilitating shared learning and experience across transplantation centers.
32340018,There has been a global outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) since December 2019.
32340018,Here, we describe the case of a 49-year-old male undergoing maintenance hemodialysis (HD) who got infected with COVID-19 and our experience in performing HD for him.
32340018,The patient's symptoms and lung imaging changes were atypical.
32340018,However, his lymphocyte range decreased upon admission and the polymerase chain reaction of the pharyngeal swab for the -COVID-19 nucleic acid was positive.
32340018,The patient developed respiratory failure and required mechanical ventilation 8 days after admission.
32340018,In the end, he died from multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.
32340018,The difficulties in diagnosis, infection control, and treatment of COVID-19 in maintenance HD patients are discussed in this report.
32340021,We describe a 2 weeks corrected gestational age infant admitted in pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) associated to Bordetella pertussis and Coronavirus infection.
32340021,He developed leukocytosis as soon as ARDS required intubation and aggressive mechanical ventilation: hence he underwent 3 early therapeutic leukapheresis treatments in order to avoid the worsening of related cardiopulmonary complications, according to recent literature on pertussis infection in infants.
32340021,The infant was discharged from PICU healthy.
32340051,The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic triggered increasing symptoms of an undiagnosed delusional disorder at a mid-60-year-old woman resulting in an attempted suicide.
32340051,Because of a pandemic with noticeable and visible social changes, it seems likely that people with previously subclinical psychotic illnesses are more often admitted to psychiatric care for the first time.
32340051,Building a therapeutic relationship and integrating her into an outpatient clinic was possible despite her lack of insight into the illness and her rejection of medical treatment.
32340051,Die SARS-CoV-2-Pandemie führte bei einer Mitte 60-jährigen Patientin zu vermehrten Symptomen einer bisher undiagnostizierten wahnhaften Störung und schließlich zu einem Suizidversuch.
32340051,Aufgrund der Pandemie mit spür- und sichtbaren gesellschaftlichen Veränderungen können Menschen mit bislang subklinischen psychotischen Erkrankungen erstmals mit psychiatrischen Versorgungsangeboten in Kontakt kommen.
32340051,Trotz fehlender Krankheitseinsicht und Ablehnung einer medikamentösen Therapie gelangen ein therapeutischer Beziehungsaufbau sowie eine tragfähige Vermittlung in ambulante Behandlungsangebote.
32340090,<b>Objective:</b> To provide a system for warning, preventing and controlling emerging infectious diseases from a macroscopic perspective, using the COVID-19 epidemic data and effective distance model. <b>Methods:</b> The dates of hospitalization/isolation treatment of the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 and the cumulative numbers of confirmed cases in different provinces in China reported as of 23 February, 2020 were collected.
32340090,The Location Based Service (LBS) big data platform of &quot;Baidu Migration&quot; was employed to obtain the data of the proportion of the floating population from Wuhan to all parts of the country.
32340090,Effective distance models and linear regression models were established to analyze the relationship between the effective distance and the arrival time of the epidemic as well as the number of cumulative confirmed cases at provincial and municipal levels. <b>Results:</b> The arrival time of the epidemic and the cumulative number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 had significant linear relationship at both provincial and municipal levels in China, and the regression coefficients of each linear model were significant (<i>P</i>&lt;0.001).
32340090,At the provincial level, the effective distance could explain about 71% of the variation of the model with arrival time along with around 90% of the variation for the model in the cumulative confirmed case magnitude; at the municipal level, the effective distance could explain about 66% of the variation for the model in arrival time, and about 85% of the variation of the model with the cumulative confirmed case magnitude. <b>Conclusions:</b> The fitting degree of the models are good.
32340090,The LBS big data and effective distance model can be used to estimate the track, time and extent of epidemic spread to provide useful reference for early warning, prevention and control of emerging infectious diseases. <b>目的：</b> 从宏观视角利用新型冠状病毒肺炎（COVID-19）疫情数据，分析有效距离与疫情传播轨迹、时间和规模之间的关系，为今后疫情防控提供科学依据。
32340090,<b>方法：</b> 收集整理截至2020年2月23日我国各地COVID-19首例确诊患者的住院治疗/隔离治疗日期以及累计确诊病例数，利用&quot;百度迁徙&quot;基于地理位置的服务大数据平台(LBS)获取武汉市到各地的迁出人口比例数据，建立有效距离模型和线性回归模型，从省级和市级层面分别对有效距离与疫情抵达时间及累计确诊病例级数的关系进行分析。
32340090,<b>结果：</b> 不论在省级层面还是市级层面上，武汉市到目的地的有效距离与COVID-19疫情抵达时间及累计确诊病例级数都存在明显的线性关联，各线性模型回归系数均有统计学意义（<i>P</i>&lt;0.001）。
32340090,在省级层面上，有效距离可以解释其与抵达时间模型71%的变异，解释其与累计确诊病例级数模型90%的变异；在市级层面上，有效距离可以解释其与抵达时间模型66%的变异，解释其与累计确诊病例级数模型85%的变异。
32340090,<b>结论：</b> 模型拟合程度较好，LBS大数据与有效距离模型能够用于对疫情传播轨迹、时间和规模等进行估计，为突发急性传染病宏观预警及防控管理工作提供有益参考。.
32340091,<b>Objective:</b> By describing and analyzing the epidemic characteristics and trends of the attack rate, the crude mortality and relevant indexes in Hubei province during the pandemic of COVID-19 to provide comprehensive evaluations of the epidemic trends and the effects of intervention measures. <b>Methods:</b> Based on the case data reported in Hubei province during the COVID-19 epidemic, combined with the important time of major interventions and event, the cumulative attack rate, the sequential increase rate of new cases, baseline increase rate of new cases, the observation- confirmed case conversion rate, the cumulative crude mortality, the daily severe case rate, and the ratio of death to severe were used to describe and analyze the epidemic characteristics in different phases of the COVID-19 epidemic. <b>Results:</b> The epidemic experienced an outbreak phase from January 10 to February 3 with large amount of case reported, a peak phase from February 4 to February 19 with continuous increasing number of new cases and deaths, a platform phase from February 20 to March 3 with balanced diagnosis and treatment number, and a descending phase from March 4 to March 18 with decreased diagnosis and increased treatment number.
32340091,Up to March 18, the cumulative attack rate of the COVID-19 epidemic in Hubei province increased from 0.03/10 000 on January 19 to 11.46/10 000, from 0.04/10 000 on January 10 to 45.13/10 000 in Wuhan city, and from 0.002/ 10 000 on January 20 to 3.70/ 10 000 in other areas of Hubei province other than Wuhan city.
32340091,The increase rate of new cases fluctuated during the epidemic period and reached the highest at February 12 in Hubei province.
32340091,The cumulative crude mortality in Hubei Province increased rapidly from 1.01% on January 19 to 5.13% on January 26, then decreased to 2.54% on February 13, and then slowly increased to 4.62% on March 18, and similar trend was also observed in Wuhan city.
32340091,The daily severe rate in Hubei Province increased from 26.88% on January 27 to 34.27% on March 18.
32340091,The ratio of death to severe decreased from 7.37% on January 23 to 0.35% on March 18. <b>Conclusions:</b> The epidemic cycle of COVID-19 in Hubei province proposed to be 60 days, which was about 1.76 times of the combination of the longest incubation period or isolation period (14 d) and the average hospitalization time of confirmed patients in Hubei province (20 d).
32340091,It suggested that the major anti-epidemic decisions made in China were effective. <b>目的：</b> 本研究通过描述和分析新型冠状病毒肺炎（新冠肺炎）疫情期间湖北省罹患率、粗病死率等流行特征及趋势,为疫情的综合研判和防治措施效果评价提供参考。
32340091,<b>方法：</b> 通过对新冠肺炎疫情期间湖北省报告的病例数据，结合重大干预措施及事件时点，采用累计罹患率、新增病例环比增长率、新增病例定基增长率、观察-确诊转换率、累计粗病死率、每日重症率、死亡重症比等指标对疫情不同阶段的流行特征进行描述和分析。

32340092,Based on systematic review of the role of clinical treatment, disease control and scientific research, and combining with the problems exposed by the COVID-19 epidemic, suggestions were proposed to reform and improve the prevention and treatment system for major epidemics diseases in China.
32340092,In clinical treatment, it is necessary to enhance clinical staff's awareness of law-based reporting, capabilities of syndromic surveillance, the use of infectious diseases reporting systems, and to improve national or local monitoring platforms for emerging infectious diseases detection.
32340092,In terms of disease control, it is important to provide authorities to disease control departments through laws and regulations, improve the quantity and quality of related human resources, and strengthen the applied research and technical readiness targeted infections disease prevention, control and emergency preparedness.
32340092,As for scientific research in major epidemic response, it is essential to strengthen research projects guided by national requests, build research institutions that can &quot;make a final decision&quot;, establish national and regional key laboratories, and strengthen strategic technical reserve for emergency disease control and treatment.
32340092,针对重大疫情防控救治，在系统梳理临床治疗、疾病控制和科学研究三者定位的基础上，结合本次新型冠状病毒肺炎疫情暴露出来的问题，提出了改革完善我国重大疫情防控救治体系的建议。
32340092,临床治疗方面，要加强医务人员依法报告意识，强化症状检测能力，充分发挥传染病直报系统的作用，建立健全新发突发传染病的国家或地方监测平台。
32340092,疾病控制方面，要从法律和体制机制上赋予疾控相关权限和保障，提升疾控队伍的数量和质量，加强防控与应急需求为导向的应用性研究和技术储备。
32340092,科学研究方面，要加强以国家需求为导向的科研立项，建设重大疫情应对中&quot;一锤定音&quot;的科研机构，建立国家和区域传染病重点实验室，加强新发突发传染病防控救治的战略技术储备。.

32340097,We compared the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), pandemic (H1N1) 2009 and COVID-19 and found that COVID-19 was more contagious, more concealed in transmission, with greater infectious intensity and more severe clinical manifestations.
32340097,If the COVID-19 epidemic is not effectively controlled, it will have a serious impact on human health, and even social development.
32340097,Recognizing the characteristics of three diseases, especially COVID-19, and improving the disease awareness of COVID-19 will help better implement the guidelines of &quot;scientific prevention and treatment, precise implementation&quot; and prevent and control COVID-19.
32340097,本文对严重急性呼吸系统综合征（SARS）、2009—2010年的甲型H1N1（2009年）大流行性流感（简称甲型H1N1大流感）和新型冠状病毒肺炎（COVID-19）流行病特征和临床特征进行了比较。
32340097,与另外两种疾病相比，COVID-19传染性更强、传播更隐蔽、传染强度更大、临床表现更严重。
32340097,如果COVID-19疫情得不到有效控制，对人类健康、乃至社会发展都将产生严重的影响。
32340097,认识三种疾病尤其是COVID-19的特征，提高对COVID-19的危害性认识，对贯彻&quot;科学防治，精准施策&quot;指导方针，做好COVID-19的防控具有一定的意义。.
32340120,The whole world is currently facing an unseen enemy, called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is causing a global pandemic.
32340120,This disease is caused by a novel single-stranded enveloped RNA virus, known as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32340120,Although huge efforts are being made to produce effective therapies to combat this disease, it continues to be one of the greatest challenges in medicine.
32340120,There is no doubt that herpesviruses are one of the most important viruses that infect humans and animals, and infections induced by these pathogens have developed into a great threat to public health.
32340120,According to the currently available evidence, the correlation between herpesviruses and coronaviruses is limited to the induced complications following the infections.
32340120,For instance, the inflammation that is induced at the sites of infection could tie these viruses to each other in a relationship.
32340120,Another example, bovine herpesvirus 1, which is an important pathogen of cattle, can cause a severe respiratory infection; the same way in which SARS-CoV-2 affects humans.
32340120,Considering the current circumstances related to the COVID-19 crisis, this editorial paper, which belongs to the Special Issue &quot;Recent Advances in Herpesviruses Research: What's in the Pipeline?
32340120,&quot; aims to draw attention to some natural anti-herpesvirus alkaloid compounds, which have recently been proven to have excellent inhibitory efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 replication.
32340120,Thus, this special focus is an attempt to hunt down various treatment options to combat COVID-19 based on repurposing drugs that are known to have multiple antiviral properties, including against herpesvirus.
32340389,The current emergency due to the worldwide spread of the COVID-19 caused by the new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a great concern for global public health.
32340389,Already in the past, the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012 demonstrates the potential of coronaviruses to cross-species borders and further underlines the importance of identifying new-targeted drugs.
32340389,An ideal antiviral agent should target essential proteins involved in the lifecycle of SARS-CoV.
32340389,Currently, some HIV protease inhibitors (i.e., Lopinavir) are proposed for the treatment of COVID-19, although their effectiveness has not yet been assessed.
32340389,The main protease (M<sup>pr</sup>) provides a highly validated pharmacological target for the discovery and design of inhibitors.
32340389,We identified potent M<sup>pr</sup> inhibitors employing computational techniques that entail the screening of a Marine Natural Product (MNP) library.
32340389,MNP library was screened by a hyphenated pharmacophore model, and molecular docking approaches.
32340389,Molecular dynamics and re-docking further confirmed the results obtained by structure-based techniques and allowed this study to highlight some crucial aspects.
32340389,Seventeen potential SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pr</sup> inhibitors have been identified among the natural substances of marine origin.
32340389,As these compounds were extensively validated by a consensus approach and by molecular dynamics, the likelihood that at least one of these compounds could be bioactive is excellent.
32340531,The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which is the cause of coronavirus disease (COVID-19 formally 2019-nCoV), has received widespread attention from the medical community.
32340531,Despite the rapid publication of research on the virus and the disease it causes, there is a lack of concise and relevant material to help busy medical providers navigate recognition and management of the disease in the ambulatory setting.
32340531,This review article aims to bridge this gap by briefly reviewing the key points of the evaluation and treatment of patients with COVID-19 in the ambulatory clinic environment.
32340541,The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has quickly become a global pandemic since its initial outbreak in China in late 2019.
32340541,Institutions are faced with the challenge of upholding the standard of care while maintaining safety for health care personnel and patients.
32340541,Due to the common performance of aerosol-generating endoscopic procedures in the upper respiratory tract, otolaryngologists are at uniquely high risk for potential infection.
32340541,When possible, alternative diagnostic and treatment strategies should be pursued.
32340541,For patients suspected of having functional laryngeal abnormalities, transcervical laryngeal ultrasound provides a rapid and noninvasive evaluation of vocal fold motion to inform decisions about safety of feeding, airway, and progression of care.
32340549,Due to the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, otolaryngologists face novel challenges when treating patients with head and neck cancer.
32340549,The purpose of this review is to evaluate the current evidence surrounding the treatment of these patients during this pandemic and to provide evidence-based recommendations with attention to increased risk in this setting.
32340549,A review of the literature was performed with PubMed.
32340549,Because recently published articles on this topic may not yet be indexed into PubMed, otolaryngology journals were hand searched for relevant articles.
32340549,Guidelines from national organizations were reviewed to identify additional relevant sources of information.
32340549,Two groups of search terms were created: one with terms related to COVID-19 and another with terms related to head and neck cancer and its management.
32340549,Searches were performed of all terms in each group as well as combinations of terms between groups.
32340549,Searches and subsequent exclusion of articles were performed in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses).
32340549,Additional articles were identified after relevant journals and guidelines from national organizations were reviewed.
32340549,Patients with head and neck mucosal malignancy require continued treatment despite the current pandemic state.
32340549,Care must be taken at all stages of treatment to minimize the risk to patients and health care workers while maintaining focus on minimizing use of limited resources.
32340549,Patient care plans should be guided by best available evidence to optimize outcomes while maintaining a safe environment in the setting of this pandemic.
32340588,To review the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on pediatric otolaryngology and provide recommendations for the management of children during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32340588,Clinical data were derived from peer-reviewed primary literature and published guidelines from national or international medical organizations.
32340588,Preprint manuscripts and popular media articles provided background information and illustrative examples.
32340588,Included manuscripts were identified via searches using PubMed, MEDLINE, and Google Scholar, while organizational guidelines and popular media articles were identified using Google search queries.
32340588,Practice guidelines were developed via consensus among all authors based on peer-reviewed manuscripts and national or international health care association guidelines.
32340588,Strict objective criteria for inclusion were not used due to the rapidly changing environment surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and a paucity of rigorous empirical evidence.
32340588,In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, medical care must be judiciously allocated to treat the most severe conditions while minimizing the risk of long-term sequelae and ensuring patient, physician, and health care worker safety.
32340588,The COVID-19 pandemic will have a profound short- and long-term impact on health care worldwide.
32340588,Although the full repercussions of this disease have yet to be realized, the outlined recommendations will guide otolaryngologists in the treatment of pediatric patients in the face of an unprecedented global health crisis.
32340654,The COVID-19 pandemic presents many medical and social issues for older people.
32340654,Presented here is a range of information arising from related areas that have impact upon the safety and efficacy of drug therapy in the context of COVID-19.
32340654,Issues include pharmacy practice, clinical therapeutics, and possible new treatments for the virus.
32340654,More information will be published in coming issues of <i>The Senior Care Pharmacist</i>.
32340737,Efficient identification and isolation of patients with communicable diseases limits exposure to health care workers, other patients, and visitors.
32340737,In August 2014, our team developed and implemented an algorithm to triage suspected cases of Ebola virus disease in a midwestern United States emergency department and outpatient clinics based on patient travel history and symptoms.
32340737,Here, we present the lessons learned and modifications to update the tool.
32340737,Two strategies were developed and utilized to properly identify, isolate, and inform on patients with suspected highly hazardous communicable diseases: 1) a robust electronic symptom and travel screen with decision support tools in the electronic medical record, and 2) the availability of workflow protocols for Ebola virus disease, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) once a person under investigation is identified.
32340737,After action reports provided opportunities to modify the algorithm and improve the identification and isolation processes.
32340737,Since our screening and travel electronic medical record inception 5 years ago, modifications changed iteratively to further enhance the screening process.
32340737,Since 2018, staff have identified 5 patients at risk for MERS; in all cases, identification occurred during the check-in process.
32340737,Exposure investigations in the emergency department decreased significantly after algorithm implementation in January 2019, from 30 in 2018 to 0 in 2019.
32340737,Although highly hazardous communicable diseases like Ebola virus disease and MERS are of concern due to their mortality rates and limited treatment options, these same concepts may be applied to the early identification and isolation of patients suspected of having more common communicable diseases like measles and influenza, emphasizing the importance of protocol-based screening in the healthcare environment.
32340751,The current outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 represents a special risk for renal patients due to their comorbidities and advanced age.
32340751,The usual performance of hemodialysis treatments in collective rooms increases the risk.
32340751,The specific information at this time in this regard is very limited.
32340751,This manuscript includes a proposal for action to prevent infection in the Nephrology Services, and in particular in Hemodialysis Units, with the objective of early identification of patients who meet the definition of a suspected case of infection by SARS-CoV-2 and propose circuits and mechanisms to carry out hemodialysis treatments.
32340751,They are recommendations in continuous review and can be modified if the epidemiological situation, the diagnostic and therapeutic options so require.
32340759,The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection which has been known as Coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19) has become an endemic emergent situation by the World Health Organization.
32340759,So far, no successful specific treatment has been found for this disease.
32340759,As has been reported, most of non-survivor patients with COVID-19 (70%) had septic shock which was significantly higher than survived ones.
32340759,Although the exact pathophysiology of septic shock in these patients is still unclear, it seems to be possible that part of it would be due to the administration of empiric antibiotics with inflammatory properties especially in the absence of bacterial infection.
32340759,Herein, we have reviewed possible molecular pathways of septic shock in the patients who have received antibiotics with inflammatory properties which mainly is release of interleukin 1β (IL-1β), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF- α) through different routes.
32340759,Altogether, we highly recommend clinicians to look after those antibiotics with anti-inflammatory activity for both empiric antibiotic therapy and reducing the inflammation to prevent septic shock in patients with diagnosed COVID-19.
32340833,In early December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), occurred in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.
32340833,On January 30, 2020 the World Health Organization declared the outbreak as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.
32340833,As of February 14, 2020, 49,053 laboratory-confirmed and 1,381 deaths have been reported globally.
32340833,Perceived risk of acquiring disease has led many governments to institute a variety of control measures.
32340833,We conducted a literature review of publicly available information to summarize knowledge about the pathogen and the current epidemic.
32340833,In this literature review, the causative agent, pathogenesis and immune responses, epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment and management of the disease, control and preventions strategies are all reviewed.
32341077,The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has placed many healthcare systems, including the NHS, under unprecedented pressure.
32341077,Mortality appears to be highest among older people and those with comorbidities, who are also often the most at risk of undernutrition in society.
32341077,Despite international efforts to identify a specific treatment, therapy remains supportive and is principally focused on optimising respiratory function.
32341077,However, the timely identification and correction of undernutrition also have the potential to improve outcomes cost-effectively, and should not be forgotten.
32341077,This piece outlines why nutritional status may be particularly compromised during this crisis, among both the population and hospital inpatients.
32341077,Practical steps to improve nutritional status at a time when hospital services are particularly stretched are also considered.
32341077,Finally, the case is made for behaviour change at all levels including government, the general population and healthcare professionals.
32341103,Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19), the disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been declared a global pandemic with significant morbidity and mortality since first appearing in Wuhan, China, in late 2019.
32341103,As many countries are grappling with the onset of their epidemics, pharmacotherapeutics remain lacking.
32341103,The window of opportunity to mitigate downstream morbidity and mortality is narrow but remains open.
32341103,The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is crucial to the homeostasis of both the cardiovascular and respiratory systems.
32341103,Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 utilises and interrupts this pathway directly, which could be described as the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-SARS-CoV-2-axis (RAAS-SCoV-axis).
32341103,There exists significant controversy and confusion surrounding how anti-hypertensive agents might function along this pathway.
32341103,This review explores the current state of knowledge regarding the RAAS-SCoV-axis, informed by prior studies of SARS-CoV, how this relates to our currently evolving pandemic, and how these insights might guide our next steps in an evidence-based manner.
32341103,This review discusses the role of the RAAS-SCoV-axis in acute lung injury and the effects, risks, and benefits of pharmacologic modification of this axis.
32341103,There may be an opportunity to leverage the different aspects of RAAS inhibitors to mitigate indirect viral-induced lung injury.
32341103,Concerns have been raised that such modulation might exacerbate the disease.
32341103,While relevant preclinical, experimental models to date favor a protective effect of RAAS-SCoV-axis inhibition on both lung injury and survival, clinical data related to the role of RAAS modulation in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 remains limited.
32341103,Proposed interventions for SARS-CoV-2 predominantly focus on viral microbiology and aim to inhibit viral cellular injury.
32341103,While these therapies are promising, immediate use may not be feasible, and the time window of their efficacy remains a major unanswered question.
32341103,An alternative approach is the modulation of the specific downstream pathophysiologic effects caused by virus that lead to morbidity and mortality.
32341103,We propose a preponderance of evidence that supports clinical equipoise regarding the efficacy of RAAS-based interventions, and the imminent need for a multisite randomised controlled clinical trial to evaluate the inhibition of the RAAS-SCoV-axis on acute lung injury in COVID-19.
32341142,In the race to contain SARS-CoV-2, efficient detection and triage of infected patients must rely on rapid and reliable testing.
32341142,In this work we performed the first evaluation of the QIAstat-Dx Respiratory SARS-CoV-2 Panel (QIAstat-SARS) for SARS-CoV-2 detection.
32341142,This assay is the first rapid multiplex PCR (mPCR) assay including SARS-CoV-2 detection, and is fully compatible with a non-PCR trained laboratory or point-of-care (POC) testing.This evaluation was performed using 69 primary clinical samples (66 NPS, 1 BAL and 1 tracheal aspirate and 1 bronchial aspirate) comparing the SARS-CoV-2 detection with the currently WHO recommended RT-PCR (WHO-PCR) workflow.
32341142,Additionally, a comparative limit of detection (LoD) assessment was performed between QIAstat-SARS and the WHO-PCR using a quantified clinical sample.
32341142,Compatibility of sample pre-treatment for viral neutralisation or viscous samples with the QIAstat-SARS system were also tested.The QIAstat-Dx Respiratory SARS-CoV-2 Panel demonstrated a comparable sensitivity to the WHO recommended assay with a limit of detection at 1000 copies/mL.
32341142,The overall percent agreement between QIAstat-Dx SARS and WHO-PCR on 69 clinical samples was 97% with a sensitivity at 100% (40/40) and specificity at 93% (27/29).
32341142,No cross reaction was encountered for any other respiratory viruses or bacteria included in the panel.The QIAstat-SARS rapid multiplex-PCR panel provides a highly sensitive, robust and accurate assay for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2.
32341142,This assay allows rapid decisions even in non-PCR trained laboratory or point-of-care testing, allowing innovative organisation.
32341442,The rapid spread of a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has led to an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32341442,Recently, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been shown to be a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 to enter host target cells.
32341442,Given that angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and an ACE inhibitor (ACEI) upregulated ACE2 expression in animal studies, the concern might arise regarding whether ARBs and ACEIs would increase the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19.
32341442,On the other hand, animal data suggested a potential protective effect of ARBs against COVID-19 pneumonia because an ARB prevented the aggravation of acute lung injury in mice infected with SARS-CoV, which is closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
32341442,Importantly, however, there is no clinical or experimental evidence supporting that ARBs and ACEIs either augment the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 or aggravate the severity and outcomes of COVID-19 at present.
32341442,Until further data are available, it is recommended that ARB and ACEI medications be continued for the treatment of patients with cardiovascular disease and hypertension, especially those at high risk, according to guideline-directed medical therapy based on the currently available evidence.
32341630,Coronaviruses are zoonotic viruses and six species of Coronaviruses are known to cause human disease such as cause common cold, severe acute respiratory syndrome and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome.
32341630,In January 2020, scientists in Wuhan, China isolated a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), responsible for an outbreak of unknown pneumonia that had not been previously reported among humans.
32341630,This virus spreads from person to person, through respiratory droplets, close contact, and by touching surfaces or objects contaminated by the virus.
32341630,The incubation period varies between 2 days and 14 days.
32341630,Symptoms usually include fever, cough, difficulty in breathing, pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome.
32341630,Older age and co-morbid conditions increase the fatality.
32341630,Any person with a history of travel to and from COVID-19 affected countries in the past 14 days or any person who has had close contact with a laboratory confirmed COVID-19 are suspect cases and needs evaluation.
32341630,Currently no vaccine is available and treatment is mainly supportive.
32341630,Measures at workplace should include- avoiding non-essential travel, identifying and isolating sick employees at the earliest, hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene, environmental hygiene and social distancing.
32341718,In the present study, I propose a novel fitting method to describe the outbreak of 2019-nCoV in China.
32341718,The fitted data were selected carefully from the non-Hubei part and Hubei Province of China respectively.
32341718,For the non-Hubei part, the time period of data collection corresponds from the beginning of the policy of isolation to present day.
32341718,But for Hubei Province, the subjects of Wuhan City and Hubei Province were included from the time of admission to the Huoshenshan Hospital to present day in order to ensure that all or the majority of the confirmed and suspected patients were collected for diagnosis and treatment.
32341718,The employed basic functions for fitting are the hyperbolic tangent functions <mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mml:mrow> <mml:mo>tanh</mml:mo> <mml:mo>(</mml:mo> <mml:mo>.</mml:mo> <mml:mo>)</mml:mo> </mml:mrow> </mml:math> since in these cases the 2019-nCoV is just an epidemic.
32341718,Subsequently, the 2019-nCoV will initially expand rapidly and tend to disappear.
32341718,Therefore, the numbers of the accumulative confirmed patients in different cities, provinces and geographical regions will initially increase rapidly and subsequently stabilize to a plateau phase.
32341718,The selection of the basic functions for fitting is crucial.
32341718,In the present study, I found that the hyperbolic tangent functions <mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mml:mrow> <mml:mo>tanh</mml:mo> <mml:mo>(</mml:mo> <mml:mo>.</mml:mo> <mml:mo>)</mml:mo> </mml:mrow> </mml:math> could satisfy the aforementioned properties.
32341718,By this novel method, I can obtain two significant results.
32341718,They base on the conditions that the rigorous isolation policy is executed continually.
32341718,Initially, I can predict the numbers very accurately of the cumulative confirmed patients in different cities, provinces and parts in China, notably, in Wuhan City with the smallest relative error estimated to <mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mml:mrow> <mml:mn>0.021</mml:mn> <mml:mo>%</mml:mo> </mml:mrow> </mml:math> , in Hubei Province with the smallest relative error estimated to <mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mml:mrow> <mml:mn>0.012</mml:mn> <mml:mo>%</mml:mo> </mml:mrow> </mml:math> and in the non-Hubei part of China with the smallest relative error of <mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mml:mo>-</mml:mo> </mml:math>  0.195% in the short-term period of infection.
32341718,In addition, perhaps I can predict the times when the plateau phases will occur respectively in different regions in the long-term period of infection.
32341718,Generally for the non-Hubei part of China, the plateau phase of the outbreak of the 2019-nCoV will be expected this March or at the end of this February.
32341718,In the non-Hubei region of China it is expected that the epidemic will cease on the 30th of March 2020 and following this date no new confirmed patient will be expected.
32341718,The predictions of the time of Inflection Points and maximum NACP for some important regions may be also obtained.
32341718,A specific plan for the prevention measures of the 2019-nCoV outbreak must be implemented.
32341718,This will involve the present returning to work and resuming production in China.
32341718,Based on the presented results, I suggest that the rigorous isolation policy by the government should be executed regularly during daily life and work duties.
32341718,Moreover, as many as possible the confirmed and suspected cases should be collected to diagnose or treat.
32341721,The COVID-19 pandemic imposed a drastic reduction in surgical activity in order to respond to the influx of hospital patients and to protect uninfected patients by avoiding hospitalization.
32341721,However, little is known about the risk of infection during hospitalization or its consequences.
32341721,The aim of this work was to report a series of patients hospitalized on digestive surgery services who developed a nosocomial infection with SARS-Cov-2 virus.
32341721,This is a non-interventional retrospective study carried out within three departments of digestive surgery.
32341721,The clinical, biological and radiological data of the patients who developed a nosocomial infection with SARS-Cov-2 were collected from the computerized medical record.
32341721,From March 1, 2020 to April 5, 2020, among 305 patients admitted to digestive surgery services, 15 (4.9%) developed evident nosocomial infection with SARS-Cov-2.
32341721,There were nine men and six women, with a median age of 62 years (35-68 years).
32341721,All patients had co-morbidities.
32341721,The reasons for hospitalization were: surgical treatment of cancer (n = 5), complex emergencies (n = 5), treatment of complications linked to cancer or its treatment (n = 3), gastroplasty (n = 1), and stoma closure (n = 1).
32341721,The median time from admission to diagnosis of SARS-Cov-2 infection was 34 days (5-61 days).
32341721,In 12 patients (80%), the diagnosis was made after a hospital stay of more than 14 days (15-63 days).
32341721,At the end of the follow-up, two patients had died, seven were hospitalized with two of them on respiratory assistance, and six patients were discharged post-hospitalization.
32341721,The risk of SARS-Cov-2 infection during hospitalization or following digestive surgery is a real and potentially serious risk.
32341721,Measures are necessary to minimize this risk in order to return to safe surgical activity.
32341910,People exposed to COVID-19 have a risk of developing disease, and health care workers are at risk at a time when they are badly needed during a health care crisis.
32341910,Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have been used as treatment and are being considered as prophylaxis.
32341910,Our patient developed COVID-19 while on hydroxychloroquine and although more work is needed, this calls into question the role of these medications as preventive therapy.
32342112,The COVID-19 pandemic and the desire to &quot;flatten the curve&quot; of transmission have significantly affected the way providers care for patients.
32342112,Female Pelvic Medicine and Reconstructive Surgeons (FPMRS) must provide high quality of care through remote access such as telemedicine.
32342112,No clear guidelines exist on the use of telemedicine in FPMRS.
32342112,Using expedited literature review methodology, we provide guidance regarding management of common outpatient urogynecology scenarios during the pandemic.
32342112,We grouped FPMRS conditions into those in which virtual management differs from direct in-person visits and conditions in which treatment would emphasize behavioral and conservative counseling but not deviate from current management paradigms.
32342112,We conducted expedited literature review on four topics (telemedicine in FPMRS, pessary management, urinary tract infections, urinary retention) and addressed four other topics (urinary incontinence, prolapse, fecal incontinence, defecatory dysfunction) based on existing systematic reviews and guidelines.
32342112,We further compiled expert consensus regarding management of FPMRS patients in the virtual setting, scenarios when in-person visits are necessary, symptoms that should alert providers, and specific considerations for FPMRS patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.
32342112,Behavioral, medical, and conservative management will be valuable as first-line virtual treatments.
32342112,Certain situations will require different treatments in the virtual setting while others will require an in-person visit despite the risks of COVID-19 transmission.
32342112,We have presented guidance for treating FPMRS conditions via telemedicine based on rapid literature review and expert consensus and presented it in a format that can be actively referenced.
32342184,In the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic there are many questions regarding the safe treatment of patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases.
32342184,Many of these questions cannot yet be answered on an evidence-based basis and this does not make patient care easy.
32342184,The German Society for Rheumatology (DGRh) hopes that these initial recommendations will provide support for specific issues in the care of patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases in view of the current threat posed by SARS-CoV-2.
32342184,In order to take advantage of the dynamic worldwide gain in knowledge for our patients, the recommendations will be updated regularly.
32342184,The updated versions of the recommendations are deposited on the homepage of the DGRh.
32342191,To illustrate the [18F]FDG-PET/CT findings in patients affected by cancer with clinical diagnosis of Covid-19 METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the cases of patients who showed pulmonary involvement unrelated to cancer metastases on March 13 and 16 2020.
32342191,We reviewed the scans, collected medical history, and exposure information.
32342191,Among the 13 scans, we identified 5 cases with imaging findings suspicious for viral infection.
32342191,Peripheral lung consolidations and/or ground-glass opacities in two or more lobes were found.
32342191,Lung abnormalities displayed increased [18F]FDG uptake (SUVmax 4.3-11.3).
32342191,All the patients on the day of PET/CT acquisition were asymptomatic, and they did not have fever or cough.
32342191,In view of the PET/CT findings, home isolation, symptom surveillance, and treatment (in 3/5 patients) were indicated.
32342191,At 1-week follow-up, 2/5 patients experienced the onset of mild respiratory symptoms.
32342191,The [18F]FDG-PET/CT can identify probable Covid-19 disease in the absence or before symptoms onset and can guide patient management.
32342191,Nuclear medicine staff needs to be aware of the possibility of contact with patients affected by the SARS-CoV-2 infection even if they do not present any symptom.
32342191,Therefore, safety measures need to be adopted for other patients and hospital staff in order to block the spread of infection.
32342479,The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical characteristics of Corona Virus Disease 2019 in Taizhou, China.
32342479,A single center retrospective observational study was performed between Jan 1, 2020 and Mar 11, 2020 at Taizhou Public Health Medical Center, Zhejiang, China.
32342479,All patients with confirmed Corona Virus Disease 2019 were enrolled, and their clinical data were gathered by reviewing electronic medical records.
32342479,Outcomes of severely ill patients and non-severely ill patients were compared.
32342479,Of 145 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the average age was 47.5 years old (standard deviation, 14.6) and 54.5% were men.
32342479,Hypertension was the most common comorbidity (15.2%), followed by diabetes mellitus (9.7%).
32342479,Common symptoms included dry cough (81.4%), fever (75.2%), anorexia (42.8%), fatigue (40.7%), chest tightness (32.4%), diarrhea (26.9%) and dizziness (20%).
32342479,According to imaging examination, 79.3% patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 18.6% showed unilateral pneumonia, 61.4% showed ground-glass opacity, and 2.1% showed no abnormal result.
32342479,Compared with non-severely ill patients, severely ill patients were older (mean, years, 52.8 vs.
32342479,45.3, p &lt; 0.01), had a higher proportion of diabetes mellitus (16.3% vs.
32342479,6.9%, p = 0.08), had a higher body mass index (mean, 24.78 vs.
32342479,23.20, p = 0.02) and were more likely to have fever (90.7% vs.
32342479,68.6%, p = 0.01), anorexia (60.5% vs.
32342479,35.3%, p = 0.01), chest tightness (60.5% vs.20.6%, p &lt; 0.01) and dyspnea (7.0% vs. 0%, p = 0.03).
32342479,Of the 43 severely ill patients, 6 (14%) received high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy, and 1 (2.3%) received invasive mechanical ventilation.
32342479,Older patients or patients with comorbidities such as obesity or diabetes mellitus were more likely to have severe condition.
32342479,Treatments of COVID-19 is still experimental and more clinical trials are needed.
32342541,COVID-19 pandemic has strained human and material resources around the world.
32342541,Practices in surgical oncology had to change in response to these resource limitations, triaging based on acuity, expected oncologic outcomes, availability of supportive resources, and safety of health care personnel.
32342541,The MD Anderson Head and Neck Surgery Treatment Guidelines Consortium devised the following to provide guidance on triaging head and neck cancer (HNC) surgeries based on multidisciplinary consensus.
32342541,HNC subsites considered included aerodigestive tract mucosa, sinonasal, salivary, endocrine, cutaneous, and ocular.
32342541,Each subsite is presented separately with disease-specific recommendations.
32342541,Options for alternative treatment modalities are provided if surgical treatment needs to be deferred.
32342541,These guidelines are intended to help clinicians caring for patients with HNC appropriately allocate resources during a health care crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.
32342541,We continue to advocate for individual consideration of cases in a multidisciplinary fashion based on individual patient circumstances and resource availability.
32342609,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a pandemic with no specific therapeutic agents and substantial mortality, and finding new treatments is critical.
32342609,Most cases are mild, but a significant minority of patients develop moderate to severe respiratory symptoms, with the most severe cases requiring intensive care and/or ventilator support.
32342609,This respiratory compromise appears to be due to a hyperimmune reaction, often called a cytokine storm.
32342609,Vagus nerve stimulation has been demonstrated to block production of cytokines in sepsis and other medical conditions.
32342609,We hypothesize that non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation (nVNS) might provide clinical benefits in patients with respiratory symptoms similar to those associated with COVID-19.
32342609,Information on two case reports was obtained via email correspondence and phone interviews with the patients.
32342609,Both patients reported clinically meaningful benefits from nVNS therapy.
32342609,In case 1, the patient used nVNS to expedite symptomatic recovery at home after hospital discharge and was able to discontinue use of opioid and cough suppressant medications.
32342609,In case 2, the patient experienced immediate and consistent relief from symptoms of chest tightness and shortness of breath, as well as an improved ability to clear his lungs.
32342609,Preliminary observations and a strong scientific foundation suggest that nVNS might provide clinical benefits in patients with COVID-19 via multiple mechanisms.
32342676,Since the first case was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China on December 12, 2019, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread widely to other countries since January 2020.
32342676,As of April 16, 2020, 10635 confirmed cases have been reported, with 230 deaths in Korea.
32342676,COVID-19 patients may be asymptomatic or show various clinical manifestations, including acute symptoms such as fever, fatigue, sore throat; pneumonia presenting as acute respiratory distress syndrome; and multiple organ failure.
32342676,As COVID-19 has such varied clinical manifestations and case fatality rates, no standard antiviral therapy regimen has been established other than supportive therapy.
32342676,In the present guideline, we aim to introduce potentially helpful antiviral and other drug therapies based on <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> research and clinical experiences from many countries.
32342677,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is spreading rapidly all over the world, being a major threat to public health.
32342677,Since clinical feature of COVID-19 has not been fully evaluated yet, empirical antibacterial agents are frequently combined for the treatment of COVID-19 in addition to antiviral agents, concerning co-existing bacterial pathogens.
32342677,We experienced a case of severe thrombocytopenia with epistaxis and petechiae, while treating a COVID-19 patient with ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, and lopinavir/ritonavir.
32342677,The platelet count decreased to 2,000/mm³ and recovered after discontinuation of the three suspected drugs.
32342677,In treating a potentially fatal emerging infectious disease, empirical and/or experimental approach would be unavoidable.
32342677,However, the present case suggests that the possibility of adverse effects caused by polypharmacy should also be carefully considered.
32342863,The COVID-19 pandemic has caused radiotherapy resource pressures and led to increased risks for lung cancer patients and healthcare staff.
32342863,An international group of experts in lung cancer radiotherapy established this practice recommendation pertaining to whether and how to adapt radiotherapy for lung cancer in the COVID-19 pandemic.
32342863,For this ESTRO &amp; ASTRO endorsed project, 32 experts in lung cancer radiotherapy contributed to a modified Delphi consensus process.
32342863,We assessed potential adaptations of radiotherapy in two pandemic scenarios.
32342863,The first, an early pandemic scenario of risk mitigation, is characterized by an altered risk-benefit ratio of radiotherapy for lung cancer patients due to their increased susceptibility for severe COVID-19 infection, and minimization of patient travelling and exposure of radiotherapy staff.
32342863,The second, a later pandemic scenario, is characterized by reduced radiotherapy resources requiring patient triage.
32342863,Six common lung cancer cases were assessed for both scenarios: peripherally located stage I NSCLC, locally advanced NSCLC, postoperative radiotherapy after resection of pN2 NSCLC, thoracic radiotherapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation for limited stage SCLC and palliative thoracic radiotherapy for stage IV NSCLC.
32342863,In a risk-mitigation pandemic scenario, efforts should be made not to compromise the prognosis of lung cancer patients by departing from guideline-recommended radiotherapy practice.
32342863,In that same scenario, postponement or interruption of radiotherapy treatment of COVID-19 positive patients is generally recommended to avoid exposure of cancer patients and staff to an increased risk of COVID-19 infection.
32342863,In a severe pandemic scenario characterized by reduced resources, if patients must be triaged, important factors for triage include potential for cure, relative benefit of radiation, life expectancy, and performance status.
32342863,Case-specific consensus recommendations regarding multimodality treatment strategies and fractionation of radiotherapy are provided.
32342863,This joint ESTRO-ASTRO practice recommendation established pragmatic and balanced consensus recommendations in common clinical scenarios of radiotherapy for lung cancer in order to address the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic.
32342870,The epidemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) first broke out in Wuhan in December 2019, and reached its peak in Wuhan in February 2020.
32342870,It became a major public health challenge for China, and evolved into a global pandemic in March 2020.
32342870,For radiation oncology departments, the COVID-19 pandemic presents a unique challenge for disease protection and prevention for both patients and staff, owing to the weakened immune systems of cancer patients and the need to deliver timely and uninterrupted radiotherapy.
32342870,At the Hubei Cancer Hospital, the only hospital in Wuhan that specializes in oncology, we organized an emergency infection control team to lead special efforts to combat COVID-19 during this challenging time.
32342870,Under its lead, the following measures were implemented in the radiation oncology department: the radiotherapy clinic was divided into different infection control zones with varying levels of protection; special staff and patient infection control training sessions were conducted and appropriate measures deployed; daily symptom testing criteria were implemented for patients undergoing treatment; special rotating schedules and infection control methods were implemented for various staff members such as medical physicists/dosimetrists and radiation therapists; modified radiotherapy workflow and specialized treatment area cleaning and disinfection policies and procedures were designed and executed; and special medical waste disposal methods were implemented.
32342870,We began treating patients using this new COVID-19 radiotherapy treatment workflow and infection control measures on January 30, 2020.
32342870,During more than one and a half months of uninterrupted radiation oncology clinical operation through the worst of the Wuhan outbreak, no known COVID-19 infection occurred at our radiotherapy center to our patients or employees.
32342870,This report may provide valuable information for other radiation oncology departments during this unprecedented public health crisis.
32342872,To derive evidence-based recommendations for the optimal utilisation of resources during unexpected shortage of radiotherapy capacity.
32342872,We have undertaken a rapid review of published literature on the role of radiotherapy in the multimodality treatment of paediatric cancers governing the European practise of paediatric radiotherapy.
32342872,The derived data has been discussed with expert paediatric radiation oncologists to derive a hierarchy of recommendations.
32342872,The general recommendations to mitigate the potential detriment of an unexpected shortage of radiotherapy facilities include: (1) maintain current standards of care as long as possible (2) refer to another specialist paediatric radiotherapy department with similar level of expertise (3) prioritise use of existing radiotherapy resources to treat patients with tumours where radiotherapy has the most effect on clinical outcome (4) use chemotherapy to defer the start of radiotherapy where timing of radiotherapy is not expected to be detrimental (5) active surveillance for low-grade tumours if appropriate and (6) consider iso-effective hypofractionated radiotherapy regimens only for selected patients with predicted poor prognosis.
32342872,The effectiveness of radiotherapy and recommendations for prioritisation of its use for common and challenging paediatric tumours are discussed.
32342872,This review provides evidence-based treatment recommendations during unexpected shortage of paediatric radiotherapy facilities.
32342872,It has wider applications for the optimal utilisation of facilities, to improve clinical outcome in low- and middle-income countries, where limited resources continue to be a challenge.
32342873,In December 2019, pneumonia of unknown cause was reported by China to WHO.
32342873,The outbreak was found to be caused by a coronavirus which was officially named &quot;severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2&quot; (SARS-CoV-2), and the disease caused by it was named 'COVID-19'.
32342873,The first case in Singapore was confirmed on 23rd January 2020.
32342873,With lessons learnt from the SARS epidemic in 2003 and the H1N1 flu pandemic in 2009, Singapore was much better prepared to deal with the virus outbreak.
32342873,The government has taken swift measures to contain and break the chain of transmission.
32342873,Healthcare workers face the challenge of keeping patients and staff safe from the disease.
32342873,There is a higher risk of mortality of COVID-19 in cancer patients and hence unique considerations for a radiation oncology department operating in an infectious disease outbreak.
32342873,This article is the recommendations and adapted workflow from the two National Cancer Centres in Singapore with the endorsement by the working committee of the Chapter of Radiation Oncology, Academy of Medicine, Singapore.
32342873,It highlights the challenges that radiation oncology departments in Singapore face and the appropriate recommended responses.
32342873,This includes interventions, business continuity plans and workflow in managing a COVID-19 positive patient on radiotherapy.
32342878,As of April 6, 2020, there are over 1,200,000 reported cases and 70,000 deaths worldwide due to COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and these numbers rise exponentially by the day [1].
32342878,According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the most effective means of minimizing the spread of the virus is through reducing interactions between individuals [2].
32342878,We performed a review of the literature, as well as national and international treatment guidelines, seeking data in support of the RADS principle (Remote visits, Avoid radiation, Defer radiation, Shorten radiation) [3] as it applies to gastrointestinal cancers.
32342878,The purpose of the present work is to guide radiation oncologists managing patients with gastrointestinal cancers during the COVID-19 crisis in order to maintain the safety of our patients, while minimizing the impact of the pandemic on cancer outcomes.
32343013,Pulmonary complications and infections frequently affect patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).
32343013,Common characteristics can predispose these patients to the development of severe respiratory illness, which may be particularly relevant during the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.
32343013,A scoping review was performed to assess the impact of pulmonary comorbidities and adverse respiratory outcomes in HNSCC patients.
32343013,Advanced age, history of tobacco and alcohol abuse, and cardiopulmonary comorbidities are significant risk factors for the development of adverse respiratory outcomes.
32343013,Treatment toxicities from radiation or chemoradiation therapy significantly increase these risks.
32343013,Respiratory complications are a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality among HNSCC patients, and the COVID-19 pandemic may disproportionately affect this population.
32343013,Interventions designed to decrease smoking and alcohol use, improve oral hygiene, and aggressively manage medical comorbidities are important to the long-term management and health of these patients.
32343086,The COVID-19 pandemic is a situation of great magnitude that most of us have not experienced in our lifetime.
32343086,Pandemics are widespread, affecting many geographical areas, and uncertainty is inherent given the rapidly changing situations.
32343086,As nurses in dialysis providing a life-sustaining therapy, we are required to provide an essential service during pandemics and need to thrive in the uncertainty.
32343086,This article offers points for consideration that can assist nephrology nurses in their approach to these uncertain times.
32343118,During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, delaying lifesaving cancer surgeries must be done with extreme caution and thoughtfulness.
32343118,Modelling indicates that delays in high-risk cancer surgeries beyond 6 weeks could affect long-term outcomes for thousands of Canadians.
32343118,Consequently, it is possible that postponing cancer surgery without consideration of its implications could cost more lives than can be saved by diverting all surgical resources to COVID-19.
32343118,This article provides general guidance on supporting curative surgical treatment where appropriate and with available resources.
32343187,At first glance, the novel coronavirus pandemic and orthopaedic surgery appear separate entities.
32343187,Orthopaedic surgeons are not generally considered front-line staff in terms of the treatment of the disease that the novel coronavirus causes compared with anaesthetic and medical colleagues.
32343187,However, the impact that the novel coronavirus is likely to have on the musculoskeletal injury burden and the morbidity associated with chronic musculoskeletal disease is significant.
32343187,This article summarises the strategies currently being developed for the remodelling of orthopaedic services in the UK and the emergency British Orthopaedic Association Standards for Trauma and Orthopaedic guidelines released on 24 March 2020 in managing urgent orthopaedic patients during the novel coronavirus pandemic.
32343410,The clinical features and treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis patients with COVID-19 is unclear and understudied.
32343410,Here, three pulmonary tuberculosis patients with COVID-19 infection were prospectively followed from hospital admission to discharge.
32343410,We provide information and experience with treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis cases with confirmed COVID-19 infection.

32343419,The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China spread worldwide, resulting in a large number of deaths.
32343419,Temporary Ark hospitals (TAH) have played an important role in controlling the spread of the epidemic in the city of Wuhan.
32343419,Taking one TAH with 800 beds as an example, we summarized details of the layout, setting, working mode of medical staffs, patient management, admission standards, discharge standards, and standards for transferring to another hospital, hospital operation, and so on.
32343419,Over the period of operation, a total of 1,124 patients were admitted for treatment.
32343419,Of these, 833 patients were cured and discharged from the hospital and 291 patients were transferred to other designated hospitals owing to aggravation of their condition.
32343419,The achievement is to have zero infection for medical staff, zero in-hospital deaths among admitted patients, and zero readmission for discharged patients.
32343419,The rapid deployment of TAH provided a suitable place for treating mild/moderate or no asymptomatic COVID-19 patients and successfully helped to control the infection in Wuhan.
32343419,The successful model of TAH would rapidly and effectively control the spread of COVID-19 in other cities.

32343423,As we write this report in April 2020, more than two million people worldwide have been infected with the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and more than 150,000 have died of COVID-19 disease.
32343423,International economies have been brought to a standstill, and social isolation based on palpable fear of death remains the order of the day.
32343423,Appropriately or not, the United States government is talking about resuming work activities and social interaction to boost economic recovery.
32343423,While this makes financial sense, from a medical perspective our population will be left defenseless in the absence of a viable treatment strategy for SARS-CoV-2.
32343423,Herein we present a plan to deal with this looming threat.

32343428,Since the first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was identified in Taiwan 2020.01.21.
32343428,Several family cluster infections were found later.
32343428,This study aimed to report family cluster infections and observe subsequent development.
32343428,We collected domestic family cluster infections among COVID-19 confirmed cases from 21 January 2020 to 16 March 2020.
32343428,There were three domestic family clusters infections in this period.
32343428,The first cluster was cases 19 to 23.
32343428,The infectious source was a Taiwanese passenger from Zhejiang.
32343428,The second cluster was cases 24 to 26 and the third cluster was cases 27 to 32.
32343428,The infectious sources of the latter clusters are currently uncertain.
32343428,All contacts of three clusters have been isolated and no new confirmed cases have been identified to date.
32343428,Some measures which have reduced the spread of these three clusters included: First, high suspicion of COVID-19 for unexplained pneumonia is very important for early detection.
32343428,Second, immediate epidemic investigation is taken especially COVID-19 is infectious during the incubation period.
32343428,Third, when the second and third clusters could not find infectious sources, CECC's press conference let the public know immediately the epidemic situation, so that people could raise their awareness and seek medical treatment or quarantine.
32343444,Elderly patients with head and neck cancer are at increased risk of adverse outcomes during and after treatment of head and neck cancer.
32343444,COVID-19 severity and mortality can be expected to be significantly greater in elderly patients with head and neck cancer, given that increased age, comorbidities, and presence of malignancy are known risk factors for disease severity and mortality in patients with COVID-19.
32343444,Therefore, their management requires multidisciplinary consensus and patient input.
32343444,A thorough geriatric assessment, which has been shown to be beneficial prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, could be particularly helpful in this patient population with the added dimension of COVID-19 risk.
32343444,In many cases, prudent treatment plan modification may allow for overall best outcomes.
32343444,Furthermore, recruitment of social services and, when appropriate, palliative care, may allow for optimal management of these patients.
32343454,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic forced significant changes in current approach to outpatient evaluation of common otolaryngology complaints as hospitals around the world are trying to limit the spread of the virus and to preserve health care resources.
32343454,These changes raise a lot of questions regarding patient triage and treatment decisions in clinical situations when it is unclear if the workup and management can be postponed.
32343454,In this communication, we present our approach to evaluation and triage of new patients with complaints concerning for salivary gland disease.
32343658,With the worldwide spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection, it is becoming increasingly urgent to develop a vaccine to prevent COVID-19, as well as effective drugs to treat it.
32343658,This article is based on a selective literature search in PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov, followed by an assessment of the ongoing clinical trials that were revealed by the search.
32343658,A number of substances have been found to prevent the reproduction of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
32343658,These include virustatic agents that have already been approved for the treatment of other types of viral infection, as well as drugs that are currently used for entirely different purposes.
32343658,High in vitro activity has been found for the nucleotide analogue remdesivir, for the antimalarial drug chloroquine, and for nitazoxanide, a drug used to treat protozoan infections.
32343658,Because the virus enters human cells by way of the membrane-associated angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), keeping the virus from docking to this receptor is a conceivable treatment approach.
32343658,Transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) plays a role in the fusion of the virus with cells; inhibitors of this enzyme are known as well.
32343658,The potential therapeutic efficacy and tolerability of these and other active substances remain to be investigated in clinical trials.
32343658,At present, more than 80 trials on COVID-10 have already been registered with Clinical- Trials.gov.
32343658,Some initial findings should already be available in late April 2020.
32343658,Clinical trials are now indispensable in order to determine the true clinical benefits and risks of the substances that have been found to be active against SARSCoV- 2 in vitro.
32343658,There is not yet any recommendation for the therapeutic use of any particular agent beyond standard supportive treatment.
32343745,To confirm the relationship between sex and the progression of Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19), and its potential mechanism, among severe patients.
32343745,For this retrospective study, we included 168 consecutive severe patients with pathogen-confirmed COVID-19 who were hospitalized between January 16th and February 4th, 2020, at Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China.
32343745,Clinical characteristics, laboratory parameters, and outcomes were compared and analyzed between males and females.
32343745,In the present study, we analyzed 168 severe patients with COVID-19, including 86 males and 82 females, and 48 patients (28.6%) were diagnosed as critically ill.
32343745,Of 86 male patients, 12.8% (11/86) died and 75.6% (65/86) were discharged; of 82 female patients, 7.3% (6/82) died and 86.6% (71/82) were discharged.
32343745,Eleven laboratory parameters showed significant differences between male and female patients, and six of them were higher during the whole clinical course in patients who died than in patients who were discharged.
32343745,In adjusted logistic regression analysis, males with comorbidities presented a higher risk of being critically ill than males without comorbidities (OR = 3.824, 95% CI = 1.279-11.435).
32343745,However, this association attenuated to null in female patients (OR = 2.992, 95% CI = 0.937-9.558).
32343745,A similar sex-specific trend was observed in the relation between age and critically ill conditions.
32343745,We highlighted sex-specific differences in clinical characteristics and prognosis.
32343745,Male patients appeared to be more susceptible to age and comorbidities.
32343745,Sex is an important biological variable that should be considered in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.
32343968,Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in late December 2019 in Wuhan, China.
32343968,Since then, COVID-19 has become a pandemic affecting more than 1.5 million people worldwide.
32343968,Patients with COVID-19 have a wide spectrum of manifestations, one being cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and its fatal correlate, secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH).
32343968,Anti-cytokine therapy such as tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor antagonist, is a potential treatment for COVID-19; however, data regarding the efficacy of this anti-IL-6 therapy are currently lacking.
32343968,We report two cases of patients who received a diagnosis of COVID-19 complicated by CRS and were treated with tocilizumab.
32343968,Both patients progressed to sHLH despite treatment with tocilizumab, and one developed viral myocarditis, challenging the safety and clinical usefulness of tocilizumab in the treatment of COVID-19-induced CRS.
32343968,These cases highlight the need for clinical trials to determine optimal patient selection and timing for the use of tocilizumab during this disease process.
32344011,The number of COVID-19 patients is dramatically increasing worldwide.
32344011,Treatment in intensive care units (ICU) has become a major challenge; therefore, early recognition of severe forms is absolutely essential for timely triaging of patients.
32344011,While the clinical status, in particular peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) levels, and concurrent comorbidities of COVID-19 patients largely determine the need for their admittance to ICUs, several laboratory parameters may facilitate the assessment of disease severity.
32344011,Clinicians should consider low lymphocyte count as well as the serum levels of CRP, D-dimers, ferritin, cardiac troponin and IL-6, which may be used in risk stratification to predict severe and fatal COVID-19 in hospitalised patients.
32344011,It is more likely that the course of the disease will be unfavourable if some or all of these parameters are altered.
32344056,Eosinophils are circulating and tissue-resident leukocytes that have potent proinflammatory effects in a number of diseases.
32344056,Recently, eosinophils have been shown to have various other functions, including immunoregulation and antiviral activity.
32344056,Eosinophil levels vary dramatically in a number of clinical settings, especially following eosinophil-targeted therapy, which is now available to selectively deplete these cells.
32344056,There are key coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related questions concerning eosinophils whose answers affect recommended prevention and care.
32344056,First, do patients with eosinophilia-associated diseases have an altered course of COVID-19?
32344056,Second, do patients with eosinopenia (now intentionally induced by biological drugs) have unique COVID-19 susceptibility and/or disease course?
32344056,This is a particularly relevant question because eosinopenia is associated with acute respiratory deterioration during infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the causative agent of COVID-19.
32344056,Third, do eosinophils contribute to the lung pathology induced during COVID-19 and will they contribute to immunopotentiation potentially associated with emerging COVID-19 vaccines?
32344056,Herein, we address these timely questions and project considerations during the emerging COVID-19 pandemic.
32344166,The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 remains a significant issue for global health, economics and society.
32344166,A wealth of data has been generated since its emergence in December 2019, and it is vital for clinicians to keep up with this data from across the world at a time of uncertainty and constantly evolving guidelines and clinical practice.
32344166,Here we provide an update for clinicians on the recent developments in the virology, diagnostics, clinical presentation, viral shedding, and treatment options for COVID-19 based on current literature.
32344166,We considered published peer-reviewed papers and non-peer-reviewed pre-print manuscripts on COVID19 and related aspects with an emphasis on clinical management aspects.
32344166,We describe the virological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and the clinical course of COVID-19 with an emphasis on diagnostic challenges, duration of viral shedding, severity markers and current treatment options.
32344166,The key challenge in managing COVID-19 remains patient density.
32344166,However, accurate diagnosis as well as early identification and management of high-risk severe cases are important for many clinicians.
32344166,For improved management of cases, there is a need to understand test probability of serology, qRT-PCR and radiological testing, and the efficacy of available treatment options that could be used in severe cases with a high risk of mortality.
32344202,The pandemic spread of a novel coronavirus - SARS coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) as a cause of acute respiratory illness, named Covid-19, is placing the healthcare systems of many countries under unprecedented stress.
32344202,Global economies are also spiraling towards a recession in fear of this new life-threatening disease.
32344202,Vaccines that prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and therapeutics that reduces the risk of severe Covid-19 are thus urgently needed.
32344202,A rapid method to derive antiviral treatment for Covid-19 is the use of convalescent plasma derived hyperimmune globulin.
32344202,However, both hyperimmune globulin and vaccine development face a common hurdle - the risk of antibody-mediated disease enhancement.
32344202,The goal of this review is to examine the body of evidence supporting the hypothesis of immune enhancement that could be pertinent to Covid-19.
32344202,We also discuss how this risk could be mitigated so that both hyperimmune globulin and vaccines could be rapidly translated to overcome the current global health crisis.
32344226,COVID-19 was originated from Wuhan city of Hubei Province in China in December 2019.
32344226,Since then it has spread in more than 210 countries and territories.
32344226,It is a viral disease due to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus.
32344226,The patients show flu-like symptoms with a dry cough, sore throat, high fever, and breathing problems.
32344226,The disease due to SARS-CoV-2 was named as COVID-19.
32344226,About 2.2 million people have been infected with more than 0.15 million deaths globally.
32344226,The United States of America is the most affected country with the highest patients of about 0.7 million.
32344226,Despite great efforts, there is no treatment of this disease.
32344226,However, prevention and management are the best options.
32344226,This article describes SARS-CoV-2, disease, prevention and management, treatment and social impact on society.
32344226,It was analyzed that a combination of antiviral drugs with hydroxyl-chloroquine and azithromycin (with the consultation of a medical practitioner) may be the best option to treat the patients, depending on the patient's conditions and symptoms.
32344226,However, Unani therapy may be useful along with allopathic treatment.
32344226,It is urgently advised and requested that all the persons should follow the preventive measures, managements and quarantine strictly without any religious discrepancy otherwise the situation may be the worst.
32344226,Also, there is an urgent requirement to educate our new generation for science and technology to fight against any such disaster in future; if any.
32344226,There is no need to be panic and proper prevention and management are essential to combat this disease.
32344226,This article may be useful to create awareness among the public, to prevent, manage and treat COVID-19.
32344304,COVID-19 pandemic is a major challenge for global and national healthcare providers.
32344304,Number of new cases is continuously increasing with an emerging trend showing worse prognosis in males in comparison to females.
32344304,Based on this observation, our proposed hypothesis is that 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors, that are commonly used for BPH treatment, may be one of the factors contributing to poorer prognosis in males.
32344310,A novel virus named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2) causes symptoms that are classified as coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
32344310,Respiratory conditions are extensively described among more serious cases of COVID-19, and the onset of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is one of the hallmark features of critical COVID-19 cases.
32344310,ARDS can be directly life-threatening because it is associated with low blood oxygenation levels and can result in organ failure.
32344310,There are no generally recognized effective treatments for COVID-19, but treatments are urgently needed.
32344310,Anti-viral medications and vaccines are in the early developmental stages and may take many months or even years to fully develop.
32344310,At present, management of COVID-19 with respiratory and ventilator support are standard therapeutic treatments, but unfortunately such treatments are associated with high mortality rates.
32344310,Therefore, it is imperative to consider novel new therapeutic interventions to treat/ameliorate respiratory conditions associated with COVID-19.
32344310,Alternate treatment strategies utilizing clinically available treatments such as hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), packed red blood cell (pRBC) transfusions, or erthropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) therapy were hypothesized to increase oxygenation of tissues by alternative means than standard respiratory and ventilator treatments.
32344310,It was also revealed that alternative treatments currently being considered for COVID-19 such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine by increasing hemoglobin production and increasing hemoglobin availability for oxygen binding and acetazolamine (for the treatment of altitude sickness) by causing hyperventilation with associated increasing levels of oxygen and decreasing levels of carbon dioxide in the blood may significantly ameliorate COVID-19 respiratory symptoms.
32344310,In conclusion, is recommend, given HBOT, pRBC, and ESA therapies are currently available and routinely utilized in the treatment of other conditions, that such therapies be tried among COVID-19 patients with serious respiratory conditions and that future controlled-clinical trials explore the potential usefulness of such treatments among COVID-19 patients with respiratory conditions.
32344313,The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a pandemic disease (COVID-19) that has spread globally causing more than 30,000 deaths.
32344313,Despite the immense and ongoing global effort, no efficacious drugs to fight this plague have been identified and patients admitted to the intensive care units (ICU), for respiratory distress, are managed mostly by means of supportive care based on oxygen maintenance.
32344313,Several authors have reported that the prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases comorbidities were indeed frequent among patients with COVID-19, which suggests that these conditions are likely to aggravate and complicate the prognosis.
32344313,What the aforementioned diseases have in common is a latent chronic inflammatory state that may be associated with the alteration of laboratory parameters that are typical of the metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance.
32344313,In severe COVID-19 patients laboratory markers of inflammation such as C-reactive protein, IL-6, D-dimer, serum ferritin and lactate dehydrogenase are elevated in many patients; assessed since the 4th-6th day of illness onset, such increases seem to be predictive of an adverse prognosis.
32344313,Our hypothesis is that drugs belonging to the family of thiazolidinediones (TZD) such as pioglitazone or rosiglitazone, approved for treating the condition of insulin resistance and the accompanying inflammation, could ameliorate the prognosis of those COVID-19 patients with diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disorders comorbidities.
32344313,TZD are PPARγ agonists that act on nuclear receptors, thereby triggering certain transcription factors.
32344313,TZD were widely used for type-2 diabetes in the first decade of this century and although concerns have been raised for possible side effects associated with long-term treatment, their use has been recently revaluated for their anti-inflammatory properties in numerous medical conditions.
32344320,To explore the clinical course and its dynamic features of immune status in COVID-19 patients and find predictors correlated with severity and prognosis of COVID-19.
32344320,The electronic medical records of 204 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia confirmed by nucleic acid testing were retrospectively collected and analyzed.
32344320,All patients were divided into severe (69) and non-severe group (135).
32344320,Lymphocyte subsets count, including CD3<sup>+</sup> T cell, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell, B cell (CD19<sup>+</sup>) and NK cell (CD16<sup>+</sup> 56<sup>+</sup>), were significantly lower in severe group (P＜0.001).
32344320,The dynamic levels of T lymphocyte in severe group were significantly lower from disease onset, but in the improved subgroup the value of T lymphocyte began to increase after about 15-day treatment and finally returned to the normal level.
32344320,The cut-off value of the counts of CD3<sup>+</sup> (576), CD4<sup>+</sup> (391) and CD8<sup>+</sup> (214) T cell were calculated and indicated significantly high sensitivity and specificity for severity of COVID-19.
32344320,Our results shown that the decrease of CD3<sup>+</sup>, CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocyte correlated with the course of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, especially in severe cases.
32344320,The level of T lymphocyte could be used as an indicator for prediction of severity and prognosis of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.
32344320,The application of glucocorticoid should be cautious in severe cases.
32344425,In the current COVID 19 pandemic, the only treatments are supportive as no definitive pharmacological intervention is available.
32344425,The heterogeneity of the immune response in different patient groups is clear with less severe illness in children.
32344425,Understanding these disparities is particularly important as severely affected patients with COVID19 cannot always be predicted before they experience a cytokine storm and multiorgan dysfunction.
32344425,Over 100 years ago, the concept of individualised immunotherapy was introduced by Sir Almroth Wright and immortalised in GB Shaw's play The Doctor's Dilemma.
32344425,Shaw's play The Doctor's Dilemma explores the issues of private medical practice, equality of health care delivery, rationing of scarce resources (intensive care) and high-risk therapies.
32344425,The play also describes the dilemma of rationing of resources and selecting the correct patient for new experimental therapies.
32344425,Immunological theories of the time are now reflected in current understanding of inflammatory responses in sepsis and immunomodulation during the COVID19 pandemic.
32344438,Preparations of health systems to accommodate large number of severely ill COVID-19 patients in March/April 2020 has a significant impact on nuclear medicine departments.
32344438,A web-based questionnaire was designed to differentiate the impact of the pandemic on inpatient and outpatient nuclear medicine operations and on public versus private health systems, respectively.
32344438,Questions were addressing the following issues: impact on nuclear medicine diagnostics and therapy, use of recommendations, personal protective equipment, and organizational adaptations.
32344438,The survey was available for 6 days and closed on April 20, 2020.  113 complete responses were recorded.
32344438,Nearly all participants (97 %) report a decline of nuclear medicine diagnostic procedures.
32344438,The mean reduction in the last three weeks for PET/CT, scintigraphies of bone, myocardium, lung thyroid, sentinel lymph-node are -14.4 %, -47.2 %, -47.5 %, -40.7 %, -58.4 %, and -25.2 % respectively.
32344438,Furthermore, 76 % of the participants report a reduction in therapies especially for benign thyroid disease (-41.8 %) and radiosynoviorthesis (-53.8 %) while tumor therapies remained mainly stable. 48 % of the participants report a shortage of personal protective equipment.
32344438,Nuclear medicine services are notably reduced 3 weeks after the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic reached Germany, Austria and Switzerland on a large scale.
32344438,We must be aware that the current crisis will also have a significant economic impact on the healthcare system.
32344438,As the survey cannot adapt to daily dynamic changes in priorities, it serves as a first snapshot requiring follow-up studies and comparisons with other countries and regions.
32344438,Die Vorbereitungen der Gesundheitssysteme auf die Aufnahme einer großen Zahl schwerkranker COVID-19-Patienten im März/April 2020 haben erhebliche Auswirkungen auf nuklearmedizinische Abteilungen und Praxen, deren Ausmaß unbekannt ist.
32344438,Ziel dieser Online-Umfrage ist es, den aktuellen Status der nuklearmedizinischen Abteilungen in Deutschland, Österreich und der Schweiz zu erfassen.
32344438,Ein webbasierter Fragebogen wurde entwickelt, um die Auswirkungen der Pandemie auf stationäre und ambulante nuklearmedizinische Abteilungen zu erfassen.
32344438,Die Fragen bezogen sich auf die folgenden Themen: Merkmale der nuklearmedizinischen Abteilung, Auswirkungen auf die nuklearmedizinische Diagnostik und Therapie, Anwendung von Empfehlungen, persönliche Schutzausrüstung (PSA) und organisatorische Anpassungen an die neuen Rahmenbedingungen.
32344438,Die Umfrage war 6 Tage lang verfügbar und wurde am 20.
32344438,April 2020 geschlossen.  113 vollständige Antworten wurden erfasst und ausgewertet.
32344438,Nahezu alle Teilnehmer (97 %) berichten über einen Rückgang der nuklearmedizinischen Diagnostik.
32344438,Die durchschnittliche Abnahme in den letzten drei Wochen für PET/CT, Szintigraphien von Knochen, Myokard, Lunge, Schilddrüse, Sentinel-Lymphknoten beträgt –14,4 %, –47,5 %, –40,7 %, –58,4 % beziehungsweise –25,2 %. 76 % der Teilnehmer berichten über einen Rückgang der Therapien.
32344438,Hiervon betroffen sind insbesondere die Radiojodtherapie von gutartigen Schilddrüsenerkrankungen (–41,8 %) und die Radiosynoviorthese (–53,8 %), während die Tumortherapien weitgehend stabil blieben. 48 % der Teilnehmer berichten über einen Mangel an persönlicher Schutzausrüstung.
32344438,Organisatorische Anpassungen wie Kurzarbeit und Versetzung von Mitarbeitern wurden in 36 % beziehungsweise 19 % berichtet.
32344438,Die nuklearmedizinischen Leistungen sind 3 Wochen, nachdem die Pandemie SARS-CoV-2 Deutschland, Österreich und die Schweiz in großem Umfang erreicht hat, deutlich reduziert.
32344438,Wir müssen uns bewusst sein, dass die gegenwärtige Krise auch erhebliche wirtschaftliche Auswirkungen auf das Gesundheitssystem haben wird, sowohl in Krankenhäusern als auch in Praxen.
32344438,Da sich die Umfrage nicht an die täglichen dynamischen Veränderungen der Prioritäten anpassen kann, dient sie als eine erste Momentaufnahme, die Folgestudien und Vergleiche mit anderen Ländern und Regionen erfordert.
32344439,The new pandemic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 causing coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) poses immense challenges to health care systems worldwide.
32344439,In the current manuscript we summarize the strategies, organisational approaches and actions of the Task-force Coronavirus at the University Medical Center Freiburg.
32344439,We also report on experiences with implementation of these approaches and treatment outcomes in the first 115 COVID patients.
32344439,Retrospective, narrative process description and analysis of the time period between end of January and beginning of April 2020, performed by representatives of the involved departments and institutes.
32344439,Additionally a retrospective observational cohort study with descriptive analysis of epidemiological and clinical data of COVID patients admitted until March 31st was performed.
32344439,A multidisciplinary Task-force Coronavirus initiated measures concerning outpatient testing and counseling, reorganisation and separation of patient flow processes alongside with substantial escalation of inpatient capacities on regular wards and intensive care units.
32344439,Within the framework of the resulting dynamic care model, 115 patients suffering from COVID could be treated without shortages in staff or bed capacities.
32344439,In the upcoming pandemic, adequate COVID management and care could be secured by a collaborative approach with inclusion of administrative departments, clinical disciplines and theoretical institutes of the University Medical Center Freiburg.
32344439,Das neue, pandemische Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 und die damit einhergehende Erkrankung COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) stellt die medizinischen Versorgungssysteme vor große Herausforderungen.
32344439,Die vorliegende Arbeit fasst die Strategie, Organisation und Maßnahmen der COVID-Taskforce des Universitätsklinikums Freiburg zusammen und berichtet über Erfahrungen und Behandlungsergebnisse von der Versorgung der ersten 115 COVID-19-Patienten.
32344439,Retrospektive, narrative Prozessbeschreibung und -analyse des Zeitraums Ende Januar bis Anfang April 2020, durchgeführt unter Mitwirken der beteiligten Departments, Kliniken und Institute des Universitätsklinikums Freiburg.
32344439,Ergänzend erfolgte eine retrospektive Beobachtungsstudie mit deskriptiver statistischer Auswertung der epidemiologischen und klinischen Daten aller bis 31.
32344439,März 2020 hospitalisierten COVID-19-Patienten.
32344439,Durch eine interdisziplinär zusammengesetzte Taskforce Coronavirus wurden Maßnahmen in den Bereichen ambulante Testung und Beratung, Separierung der Patientenströme sowie Eskalation der Versorgungskapazitäten auf Normal- und Intensivstationen im Sinne eines dynamischen Stufenmodells angeregt und umgesetzt.
32344439,Die Versorgung der ersten 115 Patienten gelang somit ohne Entstehung von Engpässen.
32344439,Durch Zusammenwirken sämtlicher Disziplinen und Abteilungen des Universitätsklinikums Freiburg konnte eine adäquate Versorgung von COVID-19-Patienten sichergestellt und die Handlungsfähigkeit des Klinikums in der aktuellen Ausbruchsituation erhalten werden.
32344441,Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory tract infection that was first identified in China.
32344441,Since its emergence in December 2019, the virus has rapidly spread, transcending geographic barriers.
32344441,The World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have declared COVID-19 as a public health crisis.
32344441,Data regarding COVID-19 in pregnancy is limited, consisting of case reports and small cohort studies.
32344441,However, obstetric patients are not immune from the current COVID-19 pandemic, and obstetric care will inevitably be impacted by the current epidemic.
32344441,As such, clinical protocols and practice on labor and delivery units must adapt to optimize the safety of patients and health care workers and to better conserve health care resources.
32344441,In this commentary, we provide suggestions to meet these goals without impacting maternal or neonatal outcomes.
32344441,KEY POINTS: • Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic.
32344441,• COVID-19 impacts care of obstetric patients.
32344441,• Health care should be adapted for the COVID-19 pandemic.
32344444,The first case of a SARS-Cov-2 virus infection was confirmed on January 27th in Munich.
32344444,For both, plastic and hand surgeons it is crucial to act responsible, minimize the transmission of the virus and aid in reasonable and adequate allocation of resources for the treatment of affected patients during this pandemia.
32344444,This article aims to provide an overview over the latest developments and insights that affect plastic and hand surgeons.
32344444,At the same time plastic and hand surgeons are required to participate actively in the discussion of new regulatory measures that on one hand aim to ensure a proper medical care of COVID-19 patients and on the other hand need to guarantee coverage of all other patients.
32344444,Furthermore exit - strategies after the pandemia need to be discussed by our societies.
32344444,Naturally, this manuscript provides insight into the current situation, which might undergo changes due to the swift progression of the pandemia.
32344444,In Deutschland wurde der erste Patient mit SARS-Cov-2 Virus Infektion am 27.
32344444,Januar 2020 in München bestätigt.
32344444,Für uns als Plastische Chirurgen und Handchirurgen ist es von zentralerBedeutung, dass wir uns als verantwortungsbewusste Menschen und Ärzte dafür einsetzen, die Übertragung von Viren zu verringern und die Ressourcen zur Behandlung von Patienten, die an der Krankheit schwer erkrankt sind, frei geben.
32344444,Die vorliegende Arbeit gibt einer Übersicht zu aktuellen Entwicklungen und Erkenntnissen für das Fachgebiet Plastische Chirurgie und für die Handchirurgie.Gleichzeitig müssen wir über unsere Fachgesellschaften aktiv Kriterien und Regularien zur Versorgung von an COVID-19 erkrankten Patienten mitgestalten, den Erhalt unserer Notfallversorgung sichern und sinnvolle Exit-Strategien erarbeiten.
32344444,Naturgemäß kann dabei gerade bei der rasanten Entwicklung der Erkenntnisse in der aktuellen Pandemie nur eine Momentaufnahme gegeben werden.
32344449,Hydroxychloroquine is an antimalarial drug being tested as a potential treatment for the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2( (SARS-CoV-2.
32344449,Although the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 remains uncertain, it may serve as a potential prophylactic agent especially in those at high risk, such as healthcare workers, household contacts of infected patients, and the immunocompromised.
32344449,Our aim was to identify possible hydroxychloroquine dosing regimens through simulation in those at high risk of infections by optimizing exposures above the in vitro generated half maximal effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub> ) and to help guide researchers in dose-selection for COVID-19 prophylactic studies.
32344449,To maintain weekly troughs above EC<sub>50</sub> in &gt;50% of subjects at steady state in a pre-exposure prophylaxis setting, an 800 mg loading dose followed by 400 mg twice or three times weekly is required.
32344449,In an exposure driven post-exposure prophylaxis setting, 800 mg loading dose followed in 6 hours by 600 mg, then 600 mg daily for 4 more days achieved daily troughs above EC<sub>50</sub> in &gt;50% subjects.
32344449,These doses are higher than recommended for malaria chemoprophylaxis, and clinical trials are needed to establish safety and efficacy.
32344456,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had a significant impact on global healthcare services.
32344456,In an attempt to limit the spread of infection and to preserve healthcare resources, one commonly used strategy has been to postpone elective surgery, whilst maintaining the provision of anaesthetic care for urgent and emergency surgery.
32344456,General anaesthesia with airway intervention leads to aerosol generation, which increases the risk of COVID-19 contamination in operating rooms and significantly exposes the healthcare teams to COVID-19 infection during both tracheal intubation and extubation.
32344456,Therefore, the provision of regional anaesthesia may be key during this pandemic, as it may reduce the need for general anaesthesia and the associated risk from aerosol-generating procedures.
32344456,However, guidelines on the safe performance of regional anaesthesia in light of the COVID-19 pandemic are limited.
32344456,The goal of this review is to provide up-to-date, evidence-based recommendations or expert opinion when evidence is limited, for performing regional anaesthesia procedures in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection.
32344456,These recommendations focus on seven specific domains including: planning of resources and staffing; modifying the clinical environment; preparing equipment, supplies and drugs; selecting appropriate personal protective equipment; providing adequate oxygen therapy; assessing for and safely performing regional anaesthesia procedures; and monitoring during the conduct of anaesthesia and post-anaesthetic care.
32344456,Implicit in these recommendations is preserving patient safety whilst protecting healthcare providers from possible exposure.
32344469,The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is an exceptional challenge for the health systems throughout the world.
32344469,So far, no causative therapy nor protective vaccines are available.
32344469,In several countries, the capacities for intensive care and for support in case of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are overstretched, and the mortality is considerable.
32344469,In this situation, useful prognostic parameters and targeted supportive treatment are urgently needed.
32344526,The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a main role in regulating blood pressure and electrolyte and liquid balance.
32344526,Previous evidence suggests that RAS may represent an important target for the treatment of lung pathologies, especially for acute respiratory distress syndrome and chronic fibrotic disease.
32344526,The scientific community has recently focused its attention on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1R) inhibitors and their possible benefit/harms for patients infected by Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) who experience pneumonia, but there are still some doubts about the effects of these drugs in this setting.
32344708,Novel coronaviruses (CoV) have emerged periodically around the world in recent years.
32344708,The recurrent spreading of CoVs imposes an ongoing threat to global health and the economy.
32344708,Since no specific therapy for these CoVs is available, any beneficial approach (including nutritional and dietary approach) is worth investigation.
32344708,Based on recent advances in nutrients and phytonutrients research, a novel combination of vitamin C, curcumin and glycyrrhizic acid (VCG Plus) was developed that has potential against CoV infection.
32344708,System biology tools were applied to explore the potential of VCG Plus in modulating targets and pathways relevant to immune and inflammation responses.
32344708,Gene target acquisition, gene ontology and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment were conducted consecutively along with network analysis.
32344708,The results show that VCG Plus can act on 88 hub targets which are closely connected and associated with immune and inflammatory responses.
32344708,Specifically, VCG Plus has the potential to regulate innate immune response by acting on NOD-like and Toll-like signaling pathways to promote interferons production, activate and balance T-cells, and regulate the inflammatory response by inhibiting PI3K/AKT, NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways.
32344708,All these biological processes and pathways have been well documented in CoV infections studies.
32344708,Therefore, our findings suggest that VCG Plus may be helpful in regulating immune response to combat CoV infections and inhibit excessive inflammatory responses to prevent the onset of cytokine storm.
32344708,However, further in vitro and in vivo experiments are warranted to validate the current findings with system biology tools.
32344708,Our current approach provides a new strategy in predicting formulation rationale when developing new dietary supplements.
32345226,Since December 2019, the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has expanded to cause a worldwide outbreak that more than 600,000 people infected and tens of thousands died.
32345226,To date, the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients in the non-Wuhan areas of Hubei Province in China have not been described.
32345226,We retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics and treatment progress of 91 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Jingzhou Central Hospital.
32345226,Of the 91 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 30 cases (33.0%) were severe and two patients (2.2%) died.
32345226,The severe disease group tended to be older (50.5 vs.
32345226,42.0 years; p = 0.049) and have more chronic disease (40% vs.
32345226,14.8%; p = 0.009) relative to mild disease group.
32345226,Only 73.6% of the patients were quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)-positive on their first tests, while typical chest computed tomography images were obtained for each patient.
32345226,The most common complaints were cough (n = 75; 82.4%), fever (n = 59; 64.8%), fatigue (n = 35; 38.5%), and diarrhea (n = 14; 15.4%).
32345226,Non-respiratory injury was identified by elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase (n = 18; 19.8%), creatinine (n = 5; 5.5%), and creatine kinase (n = 14; 15.4%) in laboratory tests.
32345226,Twenty-eight cases (30.8%) suffered non-respiratory injury, including 50% of the critically ill patients and 21.3% of the mild patients.
32345226,Overall, the mortality rate of patients in Jingzhou was lower than that of Wuhan.
32345226,Importantly, we found liver, kidney, digestive tract, and heart injuries in COVID-19 cases besides respiratory problems.
32345226,Combining chest computed tomography images with the qPCR analysis of throat swab samples can improve the accuracy of COVID-19 diagnosis.
32345443,In view of the current pandemic by SARS-CoV-2 it deems essential to understand the key concepts about the infection: its epidemiological origin, presentation, clinical course, diagnosis and treatment (still experimental in many cases).
32345443,The knowledge about the virus is still limited, but as the pandemic progresses and the physiopathology of the disease is understood, new evidence is being massively published.
32345443,Surgical specialists are facing an unprecedented situation: they must collaborate in the ER or medical wards attending these patients, while still needing to make decisions about surgical patients with probable COVID-19.
32345443,The present narrative review aims to summarize the most relevant aspects and synthetize concepts on COVID-19 for surgeons.
32345485,Use of convalescent plasma transfusions could be of great value in the current pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), given the lack of specific preventative and therapeutic options.
32345485,This convalescent plasma therapy is of particular interest when a vaccine or specific therapy is not yet available for emerging viruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19.
32345485,This report summarizes existing literature around convalescent plasma as a therapeutic option for COVID-19.
32345485,It also includes recommendations for establishing a convalescent plasma program, enhancement considerations for convalescent plasma, and considerations around pathogen reduction treatment of convalescent plasma.
32345485,Time is of the essence to set up protocols for collection, preparation, and administration of apheresis-collected convalescent plasma in response to the current pandemic.
32345485,The immediate use of convalescent plasma provides prompt availability of a promising treatment while specific vaccines and treatments are evaluated and brought to scale.
32345485,Further development of improved convalescent plasma, vaccines and other therapeutics depends on quick generation of additional data on pathogenesis and immune response.
32345485,Additionally, given the lack of information around the natural history of this disease, PRT should be considered to add a layer of safety to protect recipients of convalescent plasma.
32345594,The novel COVID-19 outbreak has affected more than 200 countries and territories as of March 2020.
32345594,Given that patients with cancer are generally more vulnerable to infections, systematic analysis of diverse cohorts of patients with cancer affected by COVID-19 is needed.
32345594,We performed a multicenter study including 105 patients with cancer and 536 age-matched noncancer patients confirmed with COVID-19.
32345594,Our results showed COVID-19 patients with cancer had higher risks in all severe outcomes.
32345594,Patients with hematologic cancer, lung cancer, or with metastatic cancer (stage IV) had the highest frequency of severe events.
32345594,Patients with nonmetastatic cancer experienced similar frequencies of severe conditions to those observed in patients without cancer.
32345594,Patients who received surgery had higher risks of having severe events, whereas patients who underwent only radiotherapy did not demonstrate significant differences in severe events when compared with patients without cancer.
32345594,These findings indicate that patients with cancer appear more vulnerable to SARS-COV-2 outbreak.
32345594,SIGNIFICANCE: Because this is the first large cohort study on this topic, our report will provide much-needed information that will benefit patients with cancer globally.
32345594,As such, we believe it is extremely important that our study be disseminated widely to alert clinicians and patients.
32345864,From February 20 to April 2020, the coronavirus SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome)-CoV-2 spread in northern Italy, drastically challenging the care capacities of the national health care system.
32345864,Unprepared for this emergency, hospitals have quickly reformulated paths of assistance in an effort to guarantee treatment for infected patients.
32345864,Orthopaedic departments have been focused on elderly traumatology, especially the treatment of femoral neck fractures in patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19).
32345864,The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the orthopaedic management strategy for femoral fragility fractures in COVID-19-positive patients with the hypothesis that operative treatment may contribute to the overall stability of the patient.
32345864,Sixteen patients affected by proximal femoral fracture and a recent history of fever, shortness of breath, and desaturation were admitted to the emergency room.
32345864,Thoracic computed tomography (CT) and oropharyngeal swabs confirmed that they were positive for COVID-19, requiring hospitalization and prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin.
32345864,Three patients died before surgery because of severe respiratory insufficiency and multiple-organ-failure syndrome.
32345864,Ten patients underwent surgery on the day after admission, whereas 3 patients had suspended their use of direct thrombin inhibitors and needed surgery to be delayed until the third day after admission.
32345864,In all patients except 1, we noted an improvement in terms of O2 saturation and assisted respiration.
32345864,In 9 patients, hemodynamic and respiratory stability was observed at an average of 7 days postoperatively.
32345864,Four patients who underwent surgical treatment died of respiratory failure on the first day after surgery (1 patient), the third day after surgery (2 patients), or the seventh day after surgery (1 patient).
32345864,We noted a stabilization of respiratory parameters in 12 COVID-19-positive patients who underwent surgery treatment of proximal femoral fractures.
32345864,We believe that in elderly patients with COVID-19 who have proximal femoral fractures, surgery may contribute to the overall stability of the patient, seated mobilization, improvement in physiological ventilation, and general patient comfort in bed.
32345864,Prognostic Level IV.
32345864,See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.
32346392,Across much of the world, cancer care has been sidelined to a variable degree by the global effort against the coronavirus pandemic.
32346392,This paper discusses the impact of coronavirus infection on cancer diagnosis and treatment in two leading cancer centres in Pakistan.
32346392,It also describes the effect that preparations for the expected surge in cases in Pakistan over the next few weeks have had on cancer care.
32346392,There is an urgent need to evaluate the effect of delays in diagnosis and treatment on cancer stage and treatment, and to decide how to minimise these during likely future cycles of lockdown over the coming months and years.
32346394,Cancer patients in conflict settings experience significant barriers in accessing chemotherapy and radiotherapy as well as palliative care and psychosocial support.
32346394,Now they face an additional possible risk of infection by SARS-CoV-2 novel coronavirus and the indirect impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on movement restrictions and their access to care.
32346394,In this commentary, we highlight that despite the low COVID-19 burden in conflict settings like Gaza, COVID-19 could lead to further inequity in cancer care and poorer outcomes for Palestinians with cancer.
32346394,This is due to the pre-existing shortage in cancer resources as well as the lack of context-specific guidelines to prepare for COVID-19 in war-torn settings.
32346491,An outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and its caused coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been reported in China since December 2019.
32346491,More than 16% of patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, and the fatality ratio was about 1%-2%.
32346491,No specific treatment has been reported.
32346491,Herein, we examine the effects of Favipiravir (FPV) versus Lopinavir (LPV)/ritonavir (RTV) for the treatment of COVID-19.
32346491,Patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who received oral FPV (Day 1: 1600 mg twice daily; Days 2-14: 600 mg twice daily) plus interferon (IFN)-α by aerosol inhalation (5 million U twice daily) were included in the FPV arm of this study, whereas patients who were treated with LPV/RTV (Days 1-14: 400 mg/100 mg twice daily) plus IFN-α by aerosol inhalation (5 million U twice daily) were included in the control arm.
32346491,Changes in chest computed tomography (CT), viral clearance, and drug safety were compared between the two groups.
32346491,For the 35 patients enrolled in the FPV arm and the 45 patients in the control arm, all baseline characteristics were comparable between the two arms.
32346491,A shorter viral clearance time was found for the FPV arm versus the control arm (median (interquartile range, IQR), 4 (2.5-9) d versus 11 (8-13) d, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001).
32346491,The FPV arm also showed significant improvement in chest imaging compared with the control arm, with an improvement rate of 91.43% versus 62.22% (<i>P</i> = 0.004).
32346491,After adjustment for potential confounders, the FPV arm also showed a significantly higher improvement rate in chest imaging.
32346491,Multivariable Cox regression showed that FPV was independently associated with faster viral clearance.
32346491,In addition, fewer adverse reactions were found in the FPV arm than in the control arm.
32346491,In this open-label nonrandomized control study, FPV showed significantly better treatment effects on COVID-19 in terms of disease progression and viral clearance; if causal, these results should be important information for establishing standard treatment guidelines to combat the SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32346492,Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was first diagnosed in Wuhan in December 2019.
32346492,The World Health Organization defined the subsequent outbreak of COVID-19 worldwide as a public health emergency of international concern.
32346492,Epidemiological data indicate that at least 20% of COVID-19 patients have severe disease.
32346492,In addition to impairment of the respiratory system, acute kidney injury (AKI) is a major complication.
32346492,Immune damage mediated by cytokine storms and concomitant AKI is a key factor for poor prognosis.
32346492,Based on previous experience of blood purification for patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome combined with clinical front-line practice, we developed a blood purification protocol for patients with severe COVID-19.
32346492,This protocol is divided into four major steps.
32346492,The first step is to assess whether patients with severe COVID-19 require blood purification.
32346492,The second step is to prescribe a blood purification treatment for patients with COVID-19.
32346492,The third step is to monitor and adjust parameters of blood purification.
32346492,The fourth step is to evaluate the timing of discontinuation of blood purification.
32346492,It is expected that blood purification will play a key role in effectively reducing the mortality of patients with severe COVID-19 through the standardized implementation of the present protocol.
32346593,Since December 2019, multiple cases of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have been reported in Wuhan in China's Hubei Province, a disease which has subsequently spread rapidly across the entire country.
32346593,Highly infectious, COVID-19 has numerous transmission channels and humans are highly susceptible to infection.
32346593,The main clinical symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, fatigue, and a dry cough.
32346593,Laboratory examination in the early stage of the disease shows a normal or decreased white blood cell count, and a decreased lymphocyte count.
32346593,While CT examination serves as the screening and diagnostic basis for COVID-19, its accuracy is limited.
32346593,The nucleic acid testing is the gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19, but has a low sensitivity is low.
32346593,There is clearly a divide between the two means of examination.
32346593,This paper reviews the published literature, guidelines and consensus, and summarizes the clinical and imaging characteristics of COVID-19, in order to provide a reliable basis for early diagnosis and treatment.
32346656,During the COVID-19 pandemic, alternative methods of care are needed to reduce the relative risk of transmission in departments.
32346656,Also needed is the ability to provide vital radiation oncological care if radiation oncologists (RO) are reallocated to other departments.
32346656,We implemented a novel remote RO SBRT coverage practice, requiring it to be reliable, of high audio and visual quality, timely, and the same level of specialty care as our current in-person treatment coverage practice.
32346656,All observed failure modes were recorded during implementation over the first 15 sequential fractions.
32346656,The time from CBCT to treatment was calculated before and after implementation to determine timeliness of remote coverage.
32346656,Image quality metrics were calculated between the imaging console screen and the RO's shared screen.
32346656,Comfort levels with audio/visual communication as well as overall comfort in comparison to in-person RO coverage was evaluated using Likert scale surveys after treatment.
32346656,Remote RO SBRT coverage was successfully implemented in 14/15 fractions with 3 observed process failures that were all corrected before treatment.
32346656,Average times of pre-treatment coverage before and after implementation were 8.74 and 8.51min, respectively.
32346656,The cross correlation between the imaging console screen and RO's shared screen was r=0.96 and lag was 0.05s.
32346656,The average value for all survey questions was above 4.5, approaching in-person RO coverage comfort levels.
32346656,Our novel method of remote RO SBRT coverage permits reduced personnel and patient interactions surrounding RT procedures.
32346656,This may help to reduce transmission of COVID-19 in our department and provides a means for SBRT coverage if ROs are reallocated to other areas of the hospital for COVID-19 support.
32346843,The magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic will result in substantial neurological disease, whether through direct infection (rare), para-infectious complications (less rare), or critical illness more generally (common).
32346843,Here, we raise the importance of stringent diagnosis and data collection regarding neurological complications of COVID-19; we urge caution in the over-diagnosis of neurological disease where it does not exist, but equally strongly encourage the concerted surveillance for such conditions.
32346843,Additional to the direct neurological complications of COVID-19 infection, neurological patients are at risk of harm from both structural limitations (such as number of intensive care beds), and a hesitancy to treat with certain necessary medications given risk of nosocomial COVID-19 infection.
32346843,We therefore also outline the specific management of patients with neuroinflammatory diseases in the context of the pandemic.
32346843,This article describes the implications of COVID-19 on neurological disease and advertises the Neurocritical Care Society's international data collection collaborative that seeks to align data elements.
32346873,Few studies reported the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected patients with completely asymptomatic throughout the disease course.
32346873,We investigated the epidemiological and clinical features of patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 without any symptoms.
32346873,Patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were retrospectively recruited.
32346873,The demographic characteristics, clinical data, treatment, and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients without any symptoms were analyzed.
32346873,Fifteen (4.4%) of 342 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients did not develop any symptom during the course of the disease.
32346873,The median time from exposure to diagnosis was 7.0 days (interquartile range [IQR]: 1.0-15.0 days).
32346873,Of the 15 patients, 14 patients were diagnosed by tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in throat swabs, while one patient was only tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in anal swabs.
32346873,During hospitalization, only 1 (6.7%) patient developed lymphopenia.
32346873,Abnormalities of chest computed tomography examinations were detected in 8 (53.4%) patients on admission.
32346873,As of 8 March 2020, all patients have been discharged.
32346873,The median time of SARS-CoV-2 tested negative from admission was 7.0 days (IQR: 4.0-9.0 days).
32346873,Patients without any symptoms but with SARS-CoV-2 exposure should be closely monitored and tested for SARS-CoV-2 both in anal and throat swabs to excluded the infection.
32346873,Asymptomatic patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 have favorable outcomes.
32346958,The global COVID-19 death toll stands at the time of writing at 163,500.
32346958,By the time you read this, that number will have increased significantly, and it is likely that we won't have seen the end of it by that time.
32346958,Policy makers in both the global north as well as the global south rose to the challenge, with decidedly mixed responses as well as decidedly mixed results, as comparisons between reported case loads of, say the UK and Germany or between Brazil and the PR of China, show.
32346958,Discipline specific responses translated into many global collaborative efforts aimed at developing treatments, modelling of the impact of varying policy options on the continuing pandemic, preventive vaccine trials, and so on and so forth.
32347053,The ongoing outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as named by the World Health Organization has millions of confirmed cases around the world and has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives.
32347053,The virus was named SARS-CoV-2 in February by International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses.
32347053,COVID-19 presents as fever, dry cough, dyspnea, headache and pneumonia.
32347053,In a small subset of severe cases, the disease quickly progresses to respiratory failure and even death.
32347053,Since the 21st century, there have been three major outbreaks caused by human coronaviruses, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) that broke out in 2003, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012, and the recent pandemic of COVID-19.
32347053,Since 2003, significant progress has been made in the study of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV concerning their natural origins, pathogenesis, antiviral development and vaccine design.
32347053,Since SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV are closely related, previous findings on SARS-CoV are highly relevant to a better understanding as well as diagnosis, treatment, prevention and control of SARS-CoV-2.
32347053,In this review, we highlight recent progresses in the field; compare the biological characteristics of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2; summarize the urgently-needed diagnostic, treatment, prevention and control options; and provide future perspectives for the outcome of the outbreak and research questions to be answered, including some of the difficulties in vaccine development.
32347053,Hopefully, our comments and suggestions would prove useful for the control of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in China and the world.
32347053,2019 新型冠状病毒的暴发持续至今，导致了世界各地数以百万计的感染个例，更夺去了数十万人的生命。
32347053,世界卫生组织在2020 年2 月将此病毒引起的疾病定名为2019 冠状病毒病 (Coronavirus disease 2019，COVID-19)，而国际病毒分类委员会也将此病毒命名为SARS-CoV-2。
32347053,COVID-19 的典型临床症状类似感冒，少数病人可发展为重症甚至死亡。
32347053,21 世纪以来，人类冠状病毒有3 次大暴发，分别是2003 年暴发的严重急性呼吸综合征(SARS)、2012 年暴发的中东呼吸综合征 (MERS) 和本次的新型肺炎。
32347053,自2003 年以来，对SARS 和MERS 冠状病毒的研究从未间断，对其自然起源、致病机理、药物筛选及疫苗研发等已取得一定进展。
32347053,鉴于SARS-CoV-2 和SARS-CoV的基因组序列高度相似，以往对SARS-CoV 的研究对深入探讨SARS-CoV-2 生物学特性、诊断、治疗和防控有很强的借鉴性。
32347053,文中通过回顾过往的研究进展，对比SARS-CoV 和SARS-CoV-2 的生物学特性，分析当前亟需的防控和诊疗措施，探讨疫苗研发所面对的一些难题，并展望疫情发展趋势及对本领域研究与开发的主要挑战，冀为我国和全世界有效控制COVID-19 疫情提供参考。.
32347112,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic during the first months of 2020 is causing profound changes in worldwide health care systems, resulting in a major reduction of surgical interventions and routine non-urgent outpatient diagnostic procedures.
32347112,The lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy, one of the most affected countries in Europe, is having severe effects on the otolaryngology medical and surgical activities.
32347112,The main changes are represented by the postponement of outpatient visits and scheduled surgery, while the only guaranteed service is reserved to diagnostics and surgery for oncology and urgent patients.
32347112,In these cases, given the sites of action typical of the otolaryngology practice, physicians and nurses are exposed to a high risk of contagion through virus aerosol transmission.
32347112,Furthermore, as the current measures of lockdown continue, it will be difficult to perform scheduled and new diagnostic assessments, medical treatments and surgical procedures in a timely manner favoring the risk of diagnostic and therapeutic delays with severe impact on patients' health.
32347144,Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has infected more than 3.0 million people worldwide and killed more than 200,000 as of April 27, 2020, making it the most lethal pandemic since the Spanish flu of 1918.<sup>1, 2</sup> COVID-19 may preferentially infect individuals with cardiovascular conditions, is more severe in subjects with cardiovascular comorbidities, may directly or indirectly affect the heart and may interact with cardiovascular medications.<sup>3</sup> In addition, the widespread effects of the pandemic on the global healthcare system affects the routine and emergency cardiac care for patients who are, may be, or are not infected with COVID-19.
32347201,We describe clinical characteristics, treatments and outcomes of 44 Caucasian patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) at a single hospital in Pavia, Italy, from 21-28 February 2020, at the beginning of the outbreak in Europe.
32347201,Seventeen patients developed severe disease, two died.
32347201,After a median of 6 days, 14 patients were discharged from hospital.
32347201,Predictors of lower odds of discharge were age &gt; 65 years, antiviral treatment and for severe disease, lactate dehydrogenase &gt; 300 mg/dL.
32347453,COVID-19 has created an urgent need for reorganization and surge planning among departments of surgery across the USA.
32347453,Review of the COVID-19 planning process and work products in preparation for a patient surge.
32347453,Organizational and process changes, workflow redesign, and communication plans are presented.
32347453,The planning process included widespread collaboration among leadership from many disciplines.
32347453,The department of surgery played a leading role in establishing clinical protocols, guidelines, and policies in preparation for a surge of COVID-19 patients.
32347453,A multidisciplinary approach with input from clinical and nonclinical stakeholders is critical to successful crisis planning.
32347453,A clear communication plan should be implemented early and input from trainees, staff, and faculty should be solicited.
32347453,Major departmental and health system reorganization is required to adapt academic surgical practices to a widespread crisis.
32347453,Surgical leadership, innovation, and flexibility are critical to successful planning and implementation.
32347743,<b>Background</b> - The novel SARs-CoV-2 coronavirus is responsible for the global COVID-19 pandemic.
32347743,Small studies have shown a potential benefit of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine ± azithromycin for the treatment of COVID-19.
32347743,Use of these medications alone, or in combination, can lead to a prolongation of the QT interval, possibly increasing the risk of Torsade de pointes (TdP) and sudden cardiac death. <b>Methods</b> - Hospitalized patients treated with chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine ± azithromycin from March 1st through the 23rd at three hospitals within the Northwell Health system were included in this prospective, observational study.
32347743,Serial assessments of the QT interval were performed.
32347743,The primary outcome was QT prolongation resulting in TdP.
32347743,Secondary outcomes included QT prolongation, the need to prematurely discontinue any of the medications due to QT prolongation and arrhythmogenic death. <b>Results</b> - Two hundred one patients were treated for COVID-19 with chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine.
32347743,Ten patients (5.0%) received chloroquine, 191 (95.0%) received hydroxychloroquine and 119 (59.2%) also received azithromycin.
32347743,The primary outcome of TdP was not observed in the entire population.
32347743,Baseline QTc intervals did not differ between patients treated with chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine (monotherapy group) vs. those treated with combination group (chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin) (440.6 ± 24.9 ms vs.
32347743,439.9 ± 24.7 ms, p =0.834).
32347743,The maximum QTc during treatment was significantly longer in the combination group vs the monotherapy group (470.4 ± 45.0 ms vs.
32347743,453.3 ± 37.0 ms, p = 0.004).
32347743,Seven patients (3.5%) required discontinuation of these medications due to QTc prolongation.
32347743,No arrhythmogenic deaths were reported. <b>Conclusions</b> - In the largest reported cohort of COVID-19 patients to date treated with chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine {plus minus} azithromycin, no instances of TdP or arrhythmogenic death were reported.
32347743,Although use of these medications resulted in QT prolongation, clinicians seldomly needed to discontinue therapy.
32347743,Further study of the need for QT interval monitoring is needed before final recommendations can be made.
32347745,The current outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 has and continues to put huge pressure on intensive care units (ICUs) worldwide.
32347745,Many patients with COVID-19 require some form of respiratory support and often have prolonged ICU stays, which results in a critical shortage of ICU beds.
32347745,It is therefore not always physically possible to treat all the patients who require intensive care, raising major ethical dilemmas related to which patients should benefit from the limited resources and which should not.
32347745,Here we consider some of the approaches to the acute shortages seen during this and other epidemics, including some guidelines for triaging ICU admissions and treatments.
32347761,Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, planned medical and surgical activities are being postponed.
32347761,For the dermatology community, this interruption to the healthcare system can lead to delays in the diagnosis and treatment of melanoma.
32347761,Neglecting melanoma during this crisis can result in increased mortality, morbidity and healthcare costs.
32347761,With the COVID-19 pandemic evolving and no clear solutions in sight, it is time for the prospective evaluation of teledermatology.
32347761,However, dermatologists should be cautious and continue seeing patients with pigmented lesions in person due to the necessity of early surgical intervention.
32347772,In the first two months of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Republic of Korea (South Korea) had the second highest number of cases globally yet was able to dramatically lower the incidence of new cases and sustain a low mortality rate, making it a promising example of strong national response.
32347772,We describe the main strategies undertaken and selected facilitators and challenges in order to identify transferable lessons for other countries working to control the spread and impact of COVID-19.
32347772,Identified strategies included early recognition of the threat and rapid activation of national response protocols led by national leadership; rapid establishment of diagnostic capacity; scale-up of measures for preventing community transmission; and redesigning the triage and treatment systems, mobilizing the necessary resources for clinical care.
32347772,Facilitators included existing hospital capacity, the epidemiology of the COVID-19 outbreak, and strong national leadership despite political changes and population sensitization due to the 2015 Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV) epidemic.
32347772,Challenges included sustaining adequate human resources and supplies in high-caseload areas.
32347772,Key recommendations include (1) recognize the problem, (2) establish diagnostic capacity, (3) implement aggressive measures to prevent community transmission, (4) redesign and reallocate clinical resources for the new environment, and (5) work to limit economic impact through and while prioritizing controlling the spread and impact of COVID-19.
32347772,South Korea's strategies to prevent, detect, and respond to the pandemic represent applicable knowledge that can be adopted by other countries and the global community facing the enormous COVID-19 challenges ahead.
32348003,Worldwide Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic makes the management of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) more complicated, effective treatment without further dissemination is thus quite challenging.
32348003,Recently, we successfully treated three representative AMI cases, by sharing these detailed procedures, we summarized some important issues including patient screening, reperfusion strategy selecting, personnel/catheter lab protection principle, as well as operation tactics, which may lend precious experience on AMI treating during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic situation.
32348025,Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), is highly contagious with devastating impacts for healthcare systems worldwide.
32348025,Medical staff are at high risk of viral contamination and it is imperative to know what personal protective equipment is appropriate for each situation.
32348025,Furthermore, elective clinics and operations have been reduced in order to mobilize manpower to the acute specialties combatting the outbreak; appropriate differentiation between patients who require immediate care and those who can receive telephone consultation or whose treatment might viably be postponed is therefore crucial.
32348025,Italy was one of the earliest and hardest-hit European countries and therefore the Italian Skull Base Society board has promulgated specific recommendations based on consensus best practices and the literature, where available.
32348025,Only urgent surgical operations are recommended and all patients should be tested at least twice (on days 4 and 2 prior to surgery).
32348025,For positive patients, procedures should be postponed until after swab test negativization.
32348025,If the procedure is vital to the survival of the patient, FFP3 and/or PAPRs devices, goggles, full-face visor, double gloves, water-resistant gowns and protective caps, are mandatory.
32348025,For negative patients, use of at least FFP2 mask is recommended.
32348025,In all cases the use of drills, which promote the aerosolization of potentially infected mucous particles, should be avoided.
32348025,Given the potential neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2, dura handling should be minimized.
32348025,It is only through widely-agreed protocols and teamwork that we will be able to deal with the evolving and complex implications of this new pandemic.

32348042,Transplantation has become a valid therapeutic option for an increasing number of patients with end-stage organ disease.
32348042,The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection and associated disease (COVID-19) has alarmed the transplant community, since recommendations for adequate follow-up of organ transplant recipients during the acute phase of a pandemic are limited.
32348042,Furthermore, treatment options against COVID-19 disease and adequate adjustment of immunosuppression in at risk patients remain a concern.
32348042,This review summarizes current knowledge on the incidence and clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with solid organ transplantation.
32348042,It also discusses therapeutic strategies and provides general recommendations on how to proceed with transplantation programs in a time when health care resources may become scarce.
32348042,La transplantation d’organes permet de prolonger et d’améliorer la qualité de vie d’un nombre croissant de patients.
32348042,Dans le contexte de la pandémie actuelle de l’infection au coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 et de la maladie qui en découle (COVID-19), la communauté de transplantation s’interroge sur le risque encouru par les patients greffés, sur la manière d’assurer un suivi adéquat d’une population à risque, et sur le schéma thérapeutique à adopter en cas de maladie avérée.
32348042,Dans cet article nous décrivons les connaissances actuelles quant à l’incidence et à l’évolution de l’infection SARS-CoV-2 chez des patients greffés.
32348042,En accord avec les sociétés de discipline, nous proposons des recommandations de prise en charge thérapeutique, et amenons quelques éléments de réflexion en tenant compte d’une possible limitation des ressources et d’une situation pandémique évolutive.
32348043,Medical oncologists are steering a difficult course during the COVID-19 pandemic between three opposing forces : revisiting optimal standards of cancer care, facing constantly evolving shortages as some resources are being redirected, and acknowledging the paradoxical need to keep patients away from the health care facility.
32348043,This article compiles recommendations fr om cancer societies and expert opinions to provide guidance and practical solutions for the oncology clinic.
32348043,We propose that optimal standards of care be upheld, and short-term safety concerns due to exposure to SARS-CoV-2 be weighed against a long-term compromise in cancer prognosis when deciding on adjustments in cancer care.
32348043,Proper mitigation strategies in the clinic and use of less resource-heavy but equivalent treatment alternatives often allow optimal cancer care.
32348043,The magnitude of benefit of cancer treatments needs to be systematically considered.
32348044,The COVID-19 pandemic impacts the hematology practice.
32348044,Intensive chemotherapies for high-grade lymphomas and acute leukemias, multiple myeloma treatments and most hematopoietic stem cell transplantations should be performed as usual.
32348044,Low-grade lymphomas should only be treated when strictly indicated, maintenance can be postponed.
32348044,Other myeloid neoplasia and their therapies cause imunosupression; dose adjustment is recommended but no brisk stopping.
32348044,Sickle cell anemia patients are highly succeptible to severe COVID-19 course.
32348044,Thrombocytopenia and procoagulant state are associated with severe courses of COVID-19, requiring an individualized therapy.
32348044,No data indicate a risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission through blood product transfusion.
32348044,La pandémie de COVID-19 affecte la prise en charge hématologique.
32348044,Les chimiothérapies intensives pour les lymphomes agressifs et les leucémies aiguës, les traitements du myélome multiple, ainsi que la plupart des greffes de cellules souches hématopoïétiques doivent continuer à être pratiquées.
32348044,Les lymphomes de bas grade seront traités uniquement avec des indications claires ; et la maintenance repoussée.
32348044,Les autres néoplasies myéloïdes et leurs traitements causent une immunosuppression ; on recommande une adaptation des doses, mais pas d’arrêt brusque.
32348044,La drépanocytose rend les patients très vulnérables au COVID-19.
32348044,La thrombopénie signe un état procoagulant et la sévérité du COVID-19, nécessitant un traitement individualisé.
32348044,Aucune donnée n’indique de risque d’une transmission du SARS-CoV-2 par transfusion de produits sanguins.
32348046,Current pandemic implies changes in patient care in rheumatology to reduce the risk of coronavirus transmission to patients visiting health-care facilities, by organizing less frequent blood tests, using teleconsultations, and switching from intravenous to subcutaneous drug administration.
32348046,Patients under immunosuppressive treatment are considered at high risk of severe outcome and are protected accordingly by the Swiss authorities.
32348046,However, current, scarce scientific evidence suggests that patients under immunosuppressive therapy do not necessarily develop severe COVID-19 presentations.
32348046,Therefore, the current guidelines recommend pursuing the treatment throughout the pandemic.
32348046,In case of SARS-CoV-2 infection, immunosuppressive drugs should be temporarily stopped, except for glucocorticoids, hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine.
32348046,La pandémie a impliqué une réorganisation des soins en rhumatologie pour limiter les déplacements des patients : espacement des prises de sang, administration sous-cutanée des traitements, téléconsultations.
32348046,Les patients traités par immunosuppresseurs sont reconnus comme vulnérables par les autorités et bénéficient des protections qui en découlent.
32348046,Sous réserves du peu de données disponibles, il n’est pas constaté d’augmentation du risque de développer de formes graves de COVID-19 chez les patients souffrant de rhumatismes inflammatoires traités par immunosuppresseurs.
32348046,Il existe ainsi un consensus pour recommander la poursuite de ces traitements pendant la pandémie.
32348046,Leur arrêt n’est recommandé qu’en cas d’infection avérée à SARS-CoV-2, à l’exception de la prednisone, de l’hydroxychloroquine et de la sulfasalazine qui peuvent être poursuivis.
32348050,The current epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 infection poses new challenges in the management of patients with gastrointestinal or liver disease.
32348050,Consultations with patients with chronic diseases should ideally be done via telemedicine and treatments administered at home if possible.
32348050,The latter should be maintained in non-infected subjects to limit the risk of decompensation of their underlying disease.
32348050,In the event of proven infection, immunomodulatory or biological treatments will tend to be reduced or discontinued unless the disease is in a severely active phase.
32348050,Elective endoscopy should be postponed, and urgent procedures should be performed with appropriate personal protective equipment.
32348050,L’épidémie actuelle d’infection par le SARS-CoV-2 pose de nouveaux défis dans la prise en charge des patients avec pathologies gastroentérologique ou hépatologique.
32348050,Les consultations avec les patients atteints de maladies chroniques devraient se faire idéalement par télémédecine et les traitements administrés à domicile si possible.
32348050,Ces derniers doivent être maintenus chez les sujets non infectés pour limiter le risque de décompensation de leur maladie de base.
32348050,En cas d’infection avérée, on aura tendance à diminuer voire interrompre les traitements immunomodulateurs ou biologiques sauf si la maladie est en phase sévèrement active.
32348050,Les examens endoscopiques électifs doivent être reportés.
32348050,Les interventions urgentes doivent être effectuées en appliquant des mesures de protection adéquates.
32348052,The safety of NSAIDs, corticosteroids and renin-angiotensin inhibitors in COVID-19 is challenged.
32348052,NSAIDs may interfere with the defense process against viral infection and are best avoided.
32348052,Systemic corticosteroids have not shown benefit in viral infection, including other coronavirus; thus they should be avoided, unless prescribed for another indication.
32348052,The benefit-risk ratio is however clearly in favor of continuing inhaled corticosteroids in patients with asthma or COPD.
32348052,ACE inhibitors and sartans upregulate the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the pulmonary receptor for SARS-CoV-2.
32348052,Any possible clinical impact of these treatments on COVID-19 infection remains to be clarified; in the meantime, they should be continued.
32348052,La sécurité des AINS, corticoïdes et antihypertenseurs agissant sur le système rénine-angiotensine lors d’infection à COVID-19 est mise en question.
32348052,Les AINS pourraient interférer avec le processus de défense face à une infection virale ; ils sont donc plutôt à éviter.
32348052,Les corticoïdes systémiques n’ont pas montré de bénéfice lors d’infections virales, y compris à d’autres coronavirus ; ils sont à éviter, sauf si prescrits pour une autre indication.
32348052,Le rapport bénéfice/risque est en revanche clairement en faveur de la poursuite des corticostéroïdes inhalés chez les asthmatiques ou BPCO.
32348052,Les IEC et les sartans modulent l’expression de l’enzyme de conversion de l’angiotensine 2 (ACE2), récepteur pulmonaire du SARS-CoV-2.
32348052,L’impact clinique de ces traitements sur l’infection à COVID-19 reste à préciser ; en attendant, ils sont à poursuivre.
32348055,The SARS-coronavirus 2 disease initially reported in December 2019 in China (COVID-19) represents a major challenge for intensive care medicine, due to the high number of ICU admission and the prolonged stay for many patients.
32348055,Up to 5 % of COVID-19 infected patients develop severe acute hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation as supportive treatment.
32348055,Apart from early antiviral and anti-inflammatory treatment, the management of COVID-19 patients is mainly applying protective mechanical ventilation, to support the injured lungs.
32348055,However recently acquired data and clinical experience suggest that COVID-19-related ARDS presents some specificities that will be summarized in the present article.
32348055,La maladie à coronavirus SARS-Cov2 apparue en Chine en décembre 2019 (COVID-19) constitue un défi majeur pour les unités de soins intensifs en raison du nombre important d’admissions.
32348055,En effet, près de 5 % des patients infectés nécessitent une ventilation invasive et une part importante de ces patients restent aux soins intensifs durant une longue période.
32348055,À part l’approche pharmacologique antivirale et anti-inflammatoire précoce, le traitement est centré sur la ventilation mécanique protectrice, qui a fait ses preuves dans le syndrome de détresse respiratoire (SDRA) et qui constitue la pierre angulaire du traitement de l’atteinte pulmonaire du COVID-19.
32348055,Toutefois, en l’état actuel des connaissances, le SDRA sur COVID-19 présente des caractéristiques particulières qui nécessitent une approche spécifique que nous résumons dans cet article.
32348056,The rapid progression of COVID-19 is an organizational challenge for all hospitals.
32348056,To secure the patient overflow, the Department internal medicine of the University Hospital of Lausanne increased nurse and medical workforces as well as bed capacity by 65 %, with extraordinary help from other departments.
32348056,The implemented crisis management stood upon three pillars : a crisis management team, steering documents and internal communication.
32348056,In this new form, the Department had already taken care of 442 COVID-19 admissions by April 16, 2020.
32348056,Alongside organizational challenges, clinical issues such as rapid respiratory distress, clinical suspicions with negative PCR and treatment uncertainties in the absence of sufficient evidence were overcome.
32348056,Despite the peak of the pandemic appearing to have passed, the next phase could be just as complicated.
32348056,La progression rapide du COVID-19 constitue un défi organisationnel pour tous les hôpitaux.
32348056,Pour anticiper un afflux important de patients, le service de médecine interne du CHUV a ainsi augmenté ses forces de travail médico-soignantes et son nombre de lits de 65 % avec un soutien extraordinaire de toute l’institution.
32348056,Pour opérer ces changements majeurs, l’organisation de crise mise en place s’est appuyée sur trois piliers : une cellule de conduite, des documents de pilotage et une communication interne.
32348056,Sous cette nouvelle forme, le service a pris en charge 442 hospitalisations COVID-19 jusqu’au 16 avril 2020.
32348056,Si les enjeux organisationnels ont été majeurs, la gestion des situations complexes, comme les manifestations respiratoires et les multiples incertitudes cliniques diagnostiques et thérapeutiques, ont été également une gageure.
32348056,Le pic de la pandémie semble passé, mais la prochaine phase pourrait constituer un nouveau défi organisationnel.
32348166,With the capability of inducing elevated expression of ACE2, the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2, angiotensin II receptor blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ARBs/ACEIs) treatment may have a controversial role in both facilitating virus infection and reducing pathogenic inflammation.
32348166,We aimed to evaluate the effects of ARBs/ACEIs on COVID-19 in a retrospective, single-center study.
32348166,126 COVID-19 patients with preexisting hypertension at Hubei Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine (HPHTCM) in Wuhan from January 5 to February 22, 2020 were retrospectively allocated to ARBs/ACEIs group (n=43) and non-ARBs/ACEIs group (n=83) according to their antihypertensive medication. 125 age- and sex-matched COVID-19 patients without hypertension were randomly selected as non-hypertension controls.
32348166,In addition, the medication history of 1942 hypertension patients that were admitted to HPHTCM from November 1 to December 31, 2019 before COVID-19 outbreak were also reviewed for external comparison.
32348166,Epidemiological, demographic, clinical and laboratory data were collected, analyzed and compared between these groups.
32348166,The frequency of ARBs/ACEIs usage in hypertension patients with or without COVID-19 were comparable.
32348166,Among COVID-19 patients with hypertension, those received either ARBs/ACEIs or non-ARBs/ACEIs had comparable blood pressure.
32348166,However, ARBs/ACEIs group had significantly lower concentrations of CRP (p=0.049) and procalcitonin (PCT, p=0.008).
32348166,Furthermore, a lower proportion of critical patients (9.3% <i>vs</i> 22.9%; p=0.061), and a lower death rate (4.7% <i>vs</i> 13.3%; p=0.216) were observed in ARBs/ACEIs group than non-ARBs/ACEIs group, although these differences failed to reach statistical significance.
32348166,Our findings thus support the use of ARBs/ACEIs in COVID-19 patients with preexisting hypertension.
32348232,After the initial Wuhan outbreak in the end of December 2019, many new cases were found in other provinces of China and also many other countries over the world, including South Korea, Italy, Iran, Japan, and 68 other countries.
32348232,We presented a 61-year-old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus was referred to the emergency department of a referral hospital in Tehran, Iran.
32348232,The patient presented with fever, chills, and myalgia within three days.
32348232,Laboratory analysis showed increased levels of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and mild leukopenia.
32348232,SARSCoV-2 PCR test -under Iran Ministry of Health and Medical Education (MoH&amp;ME) guidelines - result was positive and the chest X-ray shows bilateral ground glass opacity.
32348232,O2 saturation was 87% (without O2 therapy).
32348232,The patient was hospitalized and treated with Oseltamivir 75 mg every 12 hours, Lopinavir/Ritonavir (Kaletra) 400/100 mg every 12 hours and hydroxychloroquine 400 mg stat.
32348232,The patient last O2 saturation measured was 93% and had no fever in the 10th day of hospitalization.
32348232,So she has been discharged from hospital and homeisolated according to Iran Ministry of Health protocol.
32348233,We report 3 patients with coronavirus disease who had a decline in respiratory status during their hospital course that responded well to intravenous steroids and interleukin-6 receptor antagonist therapy.
32348233,These patients later showed development of persistent hypoxia with increased levels of d-dimer levels and were given a diagnosis of pulmonary embolisms.
32348485,Currently, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been reported in almost all countries globally, and no effective therapy has been documented for COVID-19 and the role of convalescent plasma therapy is unknown.
32348485,In current study, 6 COVID-19 subjects with respiratory failure received convalescent plasma at a median of 21.5 days after first detection of viral shedding, all tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by 3 days after infusion, and 5 died eventually.
32348485,In conclusion, convalescent plasma treatment can discontinue SARS-CoV-2 shedding but cannot reduce mortality in critically end-stage COVID-19 patients, and treatment should be initiated earlier.
32348554,We wish to bring your attention to the PsoPROTECT (Psoriasis Patient Registry for Outcomes, Therapy and Epidemiology of Covid-19 infecTion) and SECURE-AD (Surveillance Epidemiology of Coronavirus Under Research Exclusion-Atopic Dermatitis) registries; two urgent global initiatives that address an unmet need for delineating the determinants of COVID-19 outcomes in the common cutaneous immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) psoriasis and atopic dermatitis.
32348585,The COVID-19 pandemic has spread to 185 countries with over 2.1 million confirmed cases and 145,000 deaths, as per the Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 dashboard provided at https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html.
32348585,Imaging modalities such as chest radiography, thoracic and cardiovascular ultrasound, and computed tomography have roles in the diagnosis, prognosis, monitoring, and therapy of COVID-19.
32348585,However, the potential benefits of imaging need to be balanced against resource utilization and infectious risk.
32348588,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2, a novel coronavirus from the same family as SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, has spread worldwide leading the World Health Organization to declare a pandemic.
32348588,The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), presents flu-like symptoms which can become serious in high-risk individuals.
32348588,Here, we provide an overview of the known clinical features and treatment options for COVID-19.
32348588,We carried out a systematic literature search using the main online databases (PubMed, Google Scholar, MEDLINE, UpToDate, Embase and Web of Science) with the following keywords: 'COVID-19', '2019-nCoV', 'coronavirus' and 'SARS-CoV-2'.
32348588,We included publications from 1 January 2019 to 3 April 2020 which focused on clinical features and treatments.
32348588,We found that infection is transmitted from human to human and through contact with contaminated environmental surfaces.
32348588,Hand hygiene is fundamental to prevent contamination.
32348588,Wearing personal protective equipment is recommended in specific environments.
32348588,The main symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough, fatigue, slight dyspnoea, sore throat, headache, conjunctivitis and gastrointestinal issues.
32348588,Real-time PCR is used as a diagnostic tool using nasal swab, tracheal aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage samples.
32348588,Computed tomography findings are important for both diagnosis and follow-up.
32348588,To date, there is no evidence of any effective treatment for COVID-19.
32348588,The main therapies being used to treat the disease are antiviral drugs, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and respiratory therapy.
32348588,In conclusion, although many therapies have been proposed, quarantine is the only intervention that appears to be effective in decreasing the contagion rate.
32348588,Specifically designed randomized clinical trials are needed to determine the most appropriate evidence-based treatment modality.
32348598,The current COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has emerged as a public health emergency.
32348598,All nations are seriously challenged as the virus spreads rapidly across the globe with no regard for borders.
32348598,The primary management of IBD involves treating uncontrolled inflammation with most patients requiring immune-based therapies.
32348598,However, these therapies may weaken the immune system and potentially place IBD patients at increased risk of infections and infectious complications including those from COVID-19.
32348598,To summarise the scale of the COVID-19 pandemic, review unique concerns regarding IBD management and infection risk during the pandemic and assess COVID-19 management options and drug interactions in the IBD population.
32348598,A literature review on IBD, SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 was undertaken and relevant literature was summarised and critically examined.
32348598,IBD patients do not appear to be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and there is no evidence of an association between IBD therapies and increased risk of COVID-19.
32348598,IBD medication adherence should be encouraged to prevent disease flare but where possible high-dose systemic corticosteroids should be avoided.
32348598,Patients should exercise social distancing, optimise co-morbidities and be up to date with influenza and pneumococcal vaccines.
32348598,If a patient develops COVID-19, immune suppressing medications should be withheld until infection resolution and if trial medications for COVID-19 are being considered, potential drug interactions should be checked.
32348598,IBD patient management presents a challenge in the current COVID-19 pandemic.
32348598,The primary focus should remain on keeping bowel inflammation controlled and encouraging medication adherence.
32348692,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32348692,Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) mediate viral infection of host cells.
32348692,We reasoned that differences in ACE2 or TMPRSS2 gene expression in sputum cells among asthma patients may identify subgroups at risk for COVID19 morbidity.
32348692,We analyzed gene expression for ACE2 and TMPRSS2, and for intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1)(rhinovirus receptor as a comparator), in sputum cells from 330 participants in the Severe Asthma Research Program-3 and 79 healthy controls.
32348692,Gene expression of ACE2 was lower than TMPRSS2, and expression levels of both genes was similar in asthma and health.
32348692,Among asthma patients, male gender, African Americans race, and history of diabetes mellitus, was associated with higher expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2.
32348692,Use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) was associated with lower expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, but treatment with triamcinolone acetonide (TA) did not decrease expression of either gene.
32348692,These findings differed from those for ICAM-1, where gene expression was increased in asthma and less consistent differences were observed related to gender, race, and use of ICS.
32348692,Higher expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in males, African Americans, and patients with diabetes mellitus provides rationale for monitoring these asthma subgroups for poor COVID19 outcomes.
32348692,The lower expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 with ICS use warrants prospective study of ICS use as a predictor of decreased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and decreased COVID19 morbidity.

32348711,Palliative care is an important component of health care in pandemics, contributing to symptom control, psychological support, and supporting triage and complex decision making.
32348711,To examine preparedness for, and impact of, the COVID-19 pandemic on hospices in Italy to inform the response in other countries.
32348711,Cross-sectional telephone survey, in March 2020.
32348711,Italian hospices, purposively sampled according to COVID-19 regional prevalence categorised as high (&gt;25), medium (15-25) and low prevalence (&lt;15) COVID-19 cases per 100,000 inhabitants.
32348711,A brief questionnaire was developed to guide the interviews.
32348711,Analysis was descriptive.
32348711,Seven high, five medium and four low prevalence hospices provided data.
32348711,Two high prevalence hospices had experienced COVID-19 cases among both patients and staff.
32348711,All hospices had implemented policy changes, and several had rapidly implemented changes in practice including transfer of staff from inpatient to community settings, change in admission criteria and daily telephone support for families.
32348711,Concerns included scarcity of personal protective equipment, a lack of hospice-specific guidance on COVID-19, anxiety about needing to care for children and other relatives, and poor integration of palliative care in the acute planning response.
32348711,The hospice sector is capable of responding flexibly and rapidly to the COVID-19 pandemic.
32348711,Governments must urgently recognise the essential contribution of hospice and palliative care to the COVID-19 pandemic and ensure these services are integrated into the health care system response.
32348711,Availability of personal protective equipment and setting-specific guidance is essential.
32348711,Hospices may also need to be proactive in connecting with the acute pandemic response.
32349032,The rapid surge and wide-spread of the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) overshadows the entire medical industries worldwide.
32349032,The stringent medical resources hinder the diagnostic capacity globally, while 84 thousands of new cases confirmed within a single day of 14 April 2020.
32349032,Real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with is the current first-line diagnosis, but the false-negative rate remains concerned.
32349032,Radiographic technologies and tools, including Computed tomography (CT) and Chest X-ray (CXR), were applied for initial screening and follow-up, from which provides detail diagnosis with specific pathologic features for staging and treatment arrangement.
32349032,Although the radiographic imaging is found less sensitive, numerous CT-positive patients were not screened out by RT-PCR initially and later confirmed as COVID-19 positive.
32349032,Besides, the shortage of sampling kits and the longer turn-over time of PCR examinations in some areas were noticed due to logistic issues and healthcare burden.
32349032,In this review, we will discuss the challenges and the future perspectives of using radiographic modalities for COVID-19 diagnosis in view of securing human lives amid the crisis.
32349053,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel infectious disease that started in Wuhan, China, and has rapidly spread all across the world.
32349053,With limited ability to contain the virus and relatively high transmissibility and case fatality rates, governmental institutions and pharmaceutical companies are racing to find therapeutics and vaccines that target this novel coronavirus.
32349053,However, once again, pregnant and breastfeeding women are excluded from participating in clinical trials during this pandemic.
32349053,This &quot;protection by exclusion&quot; of pregnant women from drug development and clinical therapeutic trials, even during epidemics and pandemics, is not unprecedented.
32349053,Moreover, it is both misguided and not justifiable and may have excluded them from potentially beneficial interventions.
32349053,This is another missed opportunity to obtain pregnancy-specific safety and efficacy data, because therapeutics developed for men and nonpregnant women may not be generalizable to pregnant women.
32349053,Therefore, we recommend and urge the scientific community and professional societies that, without clear justification for exclusion, pregnant women should be given the opportunity to be included in clinical trials for COVID-19 based on the concepts of justice, equity, autonomy, and informed consent.
32349115,The proposed doses of chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for treatment of COVID-19 (1000 mg/day for 10 days, CQ; 800 mg first day then 400 mg/day for 5 days, HCQ) in many guidelines worldwide, are considerably higher than the maximum recommended daily safe doses of both agents (≤2.3 mg/kg/day, CQ; ≤5.0 mg/kg/day, HCQ) for development of retinal toxicity.
32349115,Irreversible retinal damage can occur if the exposure to the safe doses is &gt;5 years.
32349115,It is not known whether exposure to high doses over a short period of time can also cause the damage.
32349115,We recommend that before prescribing CQ or HCQ, history of ocular disease should be obtained to avoid the prescription if appropriate.
32349115,If either agent is to be used, routine baseline ocular examination is not absolutely necessary.
32349115,Patients who do not have ocular disease should also be informed about the potential risk of retinal toxicity.
32349115,Both agents, however, have not yet been proven to be beneficial to COVID-19.
32349133,The novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is clinically characterized by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is responsible for a high number of patients needing mechanical ventilation or intensive care units treatment and for the elevated mortality risk.
32349133,A link between COVID-19 and multiorgan failure may be dependent on the fact that most COVID-19 patients are complicated by pneumonia, which is known to be associated with early changes of clotting and platelet activation and artery dysfunction; these changes may implicate in thrombotic-related events such as myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke.
32349133,Recent data showed that myocardial injury compatible with coronary ischemia may be detectable in SARS-CoV-2 patients and laboratory data exploring clotting system suggest the presence of a hypercoagulation state.
32349133,Thus, we performed a systematic review of COVID-19 literature reporting measures of clotting activation to assess if changes are detectable in this setting and their relationship with clinical severity.
32349133,Furthermore, we discussed the biologic plausibility of the thrombotic risk in SARS-CoV-2 and the potential use of an antithrombotic treatment.
32349517,The outbreak caused by COVID-19 is causing a major challenge to clinical management and a worldwide threat to public health.
32349517,So far, there is no specific anti-coronavirus therapy approved for the treatment of COVID-19.
32349517,Recently, as the efficacy and safety of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is widely acknowledged, it has been brought to a crucial status by the public, governments, and World Health Organization (WHO).
32349517,For a better popularization of TCM, governments have made several advances in regulations and policies for treatment and measures of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP).
32349517,Therefore, on the basis of epidemiology and virology information, we reviewed relevant meta-analysis and clinical studies of anti-coronavirus therapeutics by TCM, in the aspect of mortality, symptom improvement, duration and dosage of corticosteroid, incidence of complications and the like.
32349517,In addition, we also summarized preclinical rationale for anti-coronavirus activity by TCM in terms of virion assembly and release, as well as viral entry and replication, which could be a useful contribution for figuring out effective Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) for coronavirus, including ingredients from single monomeric compounds, Chinese herbs, Chinese herb extracts and Chinese herb formulas, or potential targets for medicine.
32349517,We would like to see these relevant studies, ranging from basic researches to clinical application, could provide some idea on effects of CHM to combat COVID-19 or other coronaviruses, and also offer new thinking for the exploration of therapeutic strategies under the guidance of TCM.
32349902,In these unprecedented times, OMFS surgeons are faced with dilemmas over the priority of treatment, safety of staff, safety of patients and the most appropriate use of available resources.
32349902,Efforts should be made to provide the best evidence-based care, which will mean revisiting old techniques, and risk stratifying patients on a case by case basis.
32349902,Recent experience from colleagues internationally has shown that even the wealthiest health care infrastructure is at best fragile.
32349902,We hope this paper will add to the debate and hopefully provide a framework for decision making in OMFS trauma care during this difficult time.
32349982,Due to the frequent presence of interstitial lung disease and widespread use of immunosuppressive treatment, systemic sclerosis (SSc) patients may be considered at risk for a more severe disease course and higher mortality when they develop Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Coronavirus - 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus infection.
32349982,Therefore, with World Scleroderma Foundation endorsement, experts from different specialties including rheumatology, virology and clinical immunology gathered virtually to answer to the main practical clinical questions regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection coming from both patients and physicians.
32349982,This preliminary advice is aligned with other national and international recommendations, adapted for SSc patients.
32350134,After analyzing the immune characteristics of patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we have identified that pathogenic T cells and inflammatory monocytes with large amount of interleukin 6 secreting may incite the inflammatory storm, which may potentially be curbed through monoclonal antibody that targets the IL-6 pathways.
32350134,Here, we aimed to assess the efficacy of tocilizumab in severe patients with COVID-19 and seek a therapeutic strategy.
32350134,The patients diagnosed as severe or critical COVID-19 in The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China (Anhui Provincial Hospital) and Anhui Fuyang Second People's Hospital were given tocilizumab in addition to routine therapy between 5 and 14 February 2020.
32350134,The changes of clinical manifestations, computerized tomography (CT) scan image, and laboratory examinations were retrospectively analyzed.
32350134,Fever returned to normal on the first day, and other symptoms improved remarkably within a few days.
32350134,Within 5 d after tocilizumab, 15 of the 20 patients (75.0%) had lowered their oxygen intake, and 1 patient needed no oxygen therapy.
32350134,CT scans manifested that the lung lesion opacity absorbed in 19 patients (90.5%).
32350134,The percentage of lymphocytes in peripheral blood, which decreased in 85.0% of patients (17/20) before treatment (mean, 15.52 ± 8.89%), returned to normal in 52.6% of patients (10/19) on the fifth day after treatment.
32350134,Abnormally elevated C-reactive protein decreased significantly in 84.2% of patients (16/19).
32350134,No obvious adverse reactions were observed.
32350134,All patients have been discharged on average 15.1 d after giving tocilizumab.
32350134,Preliminary data show that tocilizumab, which improved the clinical outcome immediately in severe and critical COVID-19 patients, is an effective treatment to reduce mortality.
32350235,Despite the rapidly increasing attention being given to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, more commonly known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the relationship between cardiovascular disease and COVID-19 has not been fully described.Methods and Results:A systematic review was undertaken to summarize the important aspects of COVID-19 for cardiologists.
32350235,Protection both for patients and healthcare providers, indication for treatments, collaboration with other departments and hospitals, and regular update of information are essentials to front COVID-19 patients.
32350235,Because the chief manifestations of COVID-19 infection are respiratory and acute respiratory distress syndrome, cardiologists do not see infected patients directly.
32350235,Cardiologists need to be better prepared regarding standard disinfection procedures, and be aware of the indications for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and its use in the critical care setting.
32350543,Due to the current COVID-19 pandemic there is a need for a rapid increase in intensive care and ventilation capacities.
32350543,Delivery times for additional intensive care respirators are currently not foreseeable.
32350543,An option to increase ventilation capacities not only for COVID-19, but for all patients requiring mechanical ventilation is to use home respirators.
32350543,Home respirators are turbine respirators, so they can usually be operated without high-pressure oxygen connections and can therefore also be used in areas outside the classical intensive care medical infrastructure.
32350543,Due to their limited technical features, home respirators are not suitable for the treatment of severely affected patients but can be used for weaning after respiratory improvement, which means that intensive care respirators are available again more quickly.
32350543,Respiratory therapists are specially trained nurses or therapists in the field of out of hospital ventilation and can independently use home ventilation respirators, for example for weaning in the intensive care unit.
32350543,Thus, they relieve intensive care nursing staff in the pandemic.
32350543,Due to the COVID-19 pandemic medical students from the Oldenburg University are currently being trained in operating home respirators to provide basic support in the hospital if necessary.
32350584,This study aimed to describe the epidemiologic characteristics of fracture in the elderly during the COVID-19.
32350584,This was a retrospective multi-centre study, which included patients who sustained fractures between 20 January and 19 February 2020.
32350584,The collected data included patients' demographics (age and gender), injury-related (injury type, fracture location, injury mechanism, places where fracture occurred), and treatment modality.
32350584,SPSS 23.0 was used to describe the data and perform some analysis.
32350584,A total of 436 patients with 453 fractures were included; there were 153 males and 283 females, with an average age of 76.2 years (standard deviation, SD, 7.7 years; 65 to 105).
32350584,For either males or females, 70-74 years was the most commonly involved age group.
32350584,A total of 317 (72.7%) patients had their fractures occurring at home.
32350584,Among 453 fractures, there were 264 (58.3%) hip fractures, accounting for 58.3%.
32350584,Fall from standing height was the most common cause of fracture, making a proportion of 89.4% (405/453).
32350584,Most fractures (95.8%, 434/453) were treated surgically, and 4.2% (19/453) were treated by plaster fixation or traction.
32350584,Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) was the most used surgical method, taking a proportion of 49.2% (223/453).
32350584,These findings highlighted the importance of primary prevention (home prevention) measures and could be used for references for individuals, health care providers, or health administrative department during the global pandemic of COVID-19.
32350686,The World Health Organization (WHO) called the outbreak of coronavirus infectious disease-2019 (COVID-19) a &quot;Public Health Emergency of International Concern&quot; (PHEIC).
32350686,According to the WHO, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), currently there are no medicines or vaccines that have been claimed to be useful in the prevention or treatment of COVID-19.
32350686,Several existing antiviral drugs, previously developed or used as treatments for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and malaria, are being investigated as COVID-19 treatments and some of them are being used in clinical trials.
32350686,According to the CDC and Chinese treatment guidelines for COVID-19, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and one of the investigational agents (remdesivir) are recommended in critically ill older patients.
32350686,The use of other potential drugs reported in different studies may be considered if treatment with first-line drugs is ineffective.
32350686,There are currently no complete data available from large randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to provide clinical guidance on the use, dosing, or duration to validate the effective role, safety profile, and adverse effects of all of the trial drugs for prophylaxis or treatment of COVID-19.
32350686,Until now, it is still unclear which drug can successfully fight against the disease.
32350686,Therefore, for the better safety of patients with COVID-19, further clinical trials and large randomized controlled studies are needed to validate the effective role, safety profile, and adverse effects of all the potential drugs.
32350686,Such a measure requires action at the global level.
32350773,The COVID-19 pandemic is reinforcing health inequities among vulnerable populations, including men who have sex with men (MSM).
32350773,We conducted a rapid online survey (April 2 to April 13, 2020) of COVID-19 related impacts on the sexual health of 1051 US MSM.
32350773,Many participants had adverse impacts to general wellbeing, social interactions, money, food, drug use and alcohol consumption.
32350773,Half had fewer sex partners and most had no change in condom access or use.
32350773,Some reported challenges in accessing HIV testing, prevention and treatment services.
32350773,Compared to older MSM, those 15-24 years were more likely to report economic and service impacts.
32350773,While additional studies of COVID-19 epidemiology among MSM are needed, there is already evidence of emerging interruptions to HIV-related services.
32350773,Scalable remote solutions such as telehealth and mailed testing and prevention supplies may be urgently needed to avert increased HIV incidence among MSM during the COVID-19 pandemic era.
32350794,The COVID-19 pandemic started in Italy in February 2020 with an exponential growth that has exceeded the number of cases reported in China.
32350794,Italian radiology departments found themselves at the forefront in the management of suspected and positive COVID cases, both in diagnosis, in estimating the severity of the disease and in follow-up.
32350794,In this context SIRM recommends chest X-ray as first-line imaging tool, CT as additional tool that shows typical features of COVID pneumonia, and ultrasound of the lungs as monitoring tool.
32350794,SIRM recommends, as high priority, to ensure appropriate sanitation procedures on the scan equipment after detecting any suspected or positive COVID-19 patients.
32350794,In this emergency situation, several expectations have been raised by the scientific community about the role that artificial intelligence can have in improving the diagnosis and treatment of coronavirus infection, and SIRM wishes to deliver clear statements to the radiological community, on the usefulness of artificial intelligence as a radiological decision support system in COVID-19 positive patients.
32350794,(1) SIRM supports the research on the use of artificial intelligence as a predictive and prognostic decision support system, especially in hospitalized patients and those admitted to intensive care, and welcomes single center of multicenter studies for a clinical validation of the test.
32350794,(2) SIRM does not support the use of CT with artificial intelligence for screening or as first-line test to diagnose COVID-19.
32350794,(3) Chest CT with artificial intelligence cannot replace molecular diagnosis tests with nose-pharyngeal swab (rRT-PCR) in suspected for COVID-19 patients.
32350796,The current global outbreak of COVID-19 represents a major challenge in terms of epidemiology, contagiousness, treatment, as well as clinical and radiological behavior of this disease.
32350796,Radiological imaging plays a key role in the diagnostic process and during the monitoring of the clinical conditions especially of patients with severe symptoms.
32350796,According to the preliminary data collected in our tertiary center, we have documented a peculiar behavior in patients requiring endotracheal intubation who underwent seriate chest X-rays.
32350796,In fact, the radiological pattern of COVID-19 patients may worsen despite a prompt amelioration after the onset of mechanical ventilation.
32350796,Thus, according to our initial evidence, we recommend to perform seriate chest X-rays in the days following the onset of mechanical ventilation even if the immediate monitoring suggests an improvement.
32350796,Studies on a larger scale are necessary to fully assess the findings at chest radiographs of critical, mechanically ventilated patients and their correlation with the long-term outcome.
32350818,In the battle against the SARS-CoV‑2 pandemic, chloroquine has emerged as a new potential therapeutic option for the treatment of infected patients.
32350818,A safety consideration for the application of chloroquine is its QTc-prolonging potential.
32350818,Thus far, no data are available on the QTc-prolonging potential of chloroquine in COVID-19 patients.
32350818,To assess the degree of chloroquine-induced QTc prolongation in hospitalised COVID-19 patients.
32350818,A baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) and ECGs recorded during chloroquine treatment were retrospectively collected in patients suspected of having COVID-19.
32350818,The QTc interval was calculated by computerised and manual interpretation.
32350818,Baseline and follow-up QTc intervals were compared using the paired samples t-test.
32350818,A total of 95 patients had a baseline ECG recording and at least one ECG recording during chloroquine therapy.
32350818,Chloroquine treatment resulted in a mean QTc prolongation of 35 ms (95% CI 28-43 ms) using computerised interpretation and 34 ms (95% CI 25-43 ms) using manual interpretation.
32350818,No torsade de pointes was observed during chloroquine treatment.
32350818,After manual review, 22 patients (23%) had a QTc interval exceeding 500 ms during chloroquine treatment.
32350818,None of these patients had a prolonged QTc interval prior to the initiation of chloroquine treatment.
32350818,Chloroquine significantly prolongs the QTc interval in a clinically relevant matter.
32350818,This highlights the need for ECG monitoring when prescribing chloroquine to COVID-19 patients.
32350857,The ongoing pandemic is having a collateral health effect on delivery of surgical care to millions of patients.
32350857,Very little is known about pandemic management and effects on other services, including delivery of surgery.
32350857,This was a scoping review of all available literature pertaining to COVID-19 and surgery, using electronic databases, society websites, webinars and preprint repositories.
32350857,Several perioperative guidelines have been issued within a short time.
32350857,Many suggestions are contradictory and based on anecdotal data at best.
32350857,As regions with the highest volume of operations per capita are being hit, an unprecedented number of operations are being cancelled or deferred.
32350857,No major stakeholder seems to have considered how a pandemic deprives patients with a surgical condition of resources, with patients disproportionally affected owing to the nature of treatment (use of anaesthesia, operating rooms, protective equipment, physical invasion and need for perioperative care).
32350857,No recommendations exist regarding how to reopen surgical delivery.
32350857,The postpandemic evaluation and future planning should involve surgical services as an essential part to maintain appropriate surgical care for the population during an outbreak.
32350857,Surgical delivery, owing to its cross-cutting nature and synergistic effects on health systems at large, needs to be built into the WHO agenda for national health planning.
32350857,Patients are being deprived of surgical access, with uncertain loss of function and risk of adverse prognosis as a collateral effect of the pandemic.
32350857,Surgical services need a contingency plan for maintaining surgical care in an ongoing or postpandemic phase.
32350861,COVID-19 is overshadowing society across the world and it will redefine many aspects of how we live and work in the future.
32350861,In a crisis, people are rightly looking for solutions from their leaders and experts and their response and actions will define them for years to come.
32350861,COVID-19 may also be such a defining moment for clinical pharmacology in terms of its role in drug development and therapy.
32350861,Though most drug development takes years from discovery to approval, for the COVID-19 pandemic, drug development is on a fundamentally different timeline.
32350928,There are currently no proven or approved treatments for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32350928,Early anecdotal reports and limited in vitro data led to the significant uptake of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), and to lesser extent chloroquine (CQ), for many patients with this disease.
32350928,As an increasing number of patients with COVID-19 are treated with these agents and more evidence accumulates, there continues to be no high-quality clinical data showing a clear benefit of these agents for this disease.
32350928,Moreover, these agents have the potential to cause harm, including a broad range of adverse events including serious cardiac side effects when combined with other agents.
32350928,In addition, the known and potent immunomodulatory effects of these agents which support their use in the treatment of auto-immune conditions, and provided a component in the original rationale for their use in patients with COVID-19, may, in fact, undermine their utility in the context of the treatment of this respiratory viral infection.
32350928,Specifically, the impact of HCQ on cytokine production and suppression of antigen presentation may have immunologic consequences that hamper innate and adaptive antiviral immune responses for patients with COVID-19.
32350928,Similarly, the reported in vitro inhibition of viral proliferation is largely derived from the blockade of viral fusion that initiates infection rather than the direct inhibition of viral replication as seen with nucleoside/tide analogs in other viral infections.
32350928,Given these facts and the growing uncertainty about these agents for the treatment of COVID-19, it is clear that at the very least thoughtful planning and data collection from randomized clinical trials are needed to understand what if any role these agents may have in this disease.
32350928,In this article, we review the datasets that support or detract from the use of these agents for the treatment of COVID-19 and render a data informed opinion that they should only be used with caution and in the context of carefully thought out clinical trials, or on a case-by-case basis after rigorous consideration of the risks and benefits of this therapeutic approach.
32351121,Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) originated in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 has been declared pandemic by World Health Organization due to an exponential rise in the number of infected and deceased persons across the globe.
32351121,Emerging reports suggest that susceptibility and mortality rates are higher in patients with certain comorbidities when compared to the average population.
32351121,Cardiovascular diseases and diabetes are important risk factors for a lethal outcome of COVID-19.
32351121,Extensive research ensuing the outbreak of coronavirus-related severe acute respiratory syndrome in the year 2003, and COVID-19 recently revealed a role of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) components in the entry of coronavirus wherein angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) had garnered the significant attention.
32351121,This raises the question whether the use of RAS inhibitors, the backbone of treatment of cardiovascular, neurovascular, and kidney diseases could increase the susceptibility for coronavirus infection or unfortunate outcomes of COVID-19.
32351121,Thus, currently, there is a lack of consensus regarding the effects of RAS inhibitors in such patients.
32351121,Moreover, expert bodies like American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology, and so on have now released official statements that RAS inhibitors must be continued, unless suggested otherwise by a physician.
32351121,In this brief review, we will elaborate on the role of RAS and ACE2 in pathogenesis of COVID-19.
32351121,Moreover, we will discuss the potential effect of the use and disuse of RAS inhibitors in patients having COVID-19 with cardiometabolic comorbidities.
32351196,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)pandemic reached Denmark in early 2020.
32351196,This paper presents initial intensive-care unit (ICU) experiences with COVID-19 patients at Roskilde Hospital, which was the primary recipient of COVID-19 patients in need of intensive care in the Zealand Region, Denmark.
32351196,An evaluation was conducted of the COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure from 11 March 2020 to 01 April 2020.
32351196,The number of ICU beds was increased from eight to 22 beds during this period.
32351196,Sixteen patients (four women) were evaluated.
32351196,The median age was 69.5 years (range: 56-84 years).
32351196,All the patients were admitted to the ICU for hypoxemic respiratory failure and all needed mechanical ventilation by orotracheal intubation.
32351196,By 16 April, six patients were still admitted to the ICU, four patients had been discharged from the ICU and seven had died.
32351196,At present, the average length of ICU stay is 14 ± 9 days (mean ± standard deviation).
32351196,One patient has remained on ventilatory support for 31 days.
32351196,The evaluation revealed four key themes.
32351196,COVID-19 patients 1) had greatly increased C-reactive protein levels, 2) needed a significant inspiratory O2fraction, 3) were highly positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) dependent on ventilatory support and 4) suffered highly fluctuating respiratory failure requiring ventilatory support for a significantly longer period of time than non-COVID-19 patients.
32351196,COVID-19 patients have characteristic reproducible laboratory findings and present a major challenge due to their illness severity and required treatment length. none. not relevant.
32351851,After an outbreak in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province of China, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly become a pandemic.
32351851,The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019 nCov), now called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causes a wide spectrum of illness and patients with underlying comorbidities have a high mortality.
32351851,Here we present a 49-year-old male patient with comorbid conditions who presented with fever, cough, myalgia and shortness of breath for five days with likely exposure to a COVID-19 contact.
32351851,A computed tomography scan of the thorax revealed multifocal bilateral ground-glass lung opacities with areas of subpleural sparing.
32351851,He tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by nucleic acid amplification.
32351851,Hydroxychloroquine therapy was started, and the patient responded favorably with improvement of symptoms.
32351851,Early diagnosis and self-isolation or quarantine remain key to stemming the tide of the contagion as there is a real risk of the healthcare system being overwhelmed.
32351873,China has been fighting the epidemic of pneumonia-like diseases first detected for over a month in the city of Wuhan in December 2019.
32351873,The disease epidemic is caused by a novel coronavirus, called COVID-19, which has now infected more than 700,000 people worldwide.
32351873,With a death toll approaching that of China's SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002 and 2003, 2019-nCoV has contributed to an international emergency in public health, placing all health organizations on high alert.
32351873,Such large numbers of infected and deceased people require an urgent need for reliable, inexpensive, and cheap drugs to control and reduce the outbreak.
32351873,To systematically review and evaluate the pattern of COVID-19 and the treatment plans.
32351873,This systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.
32351873,The articles were searched from databases like PubMed, the Cochrane Library, ScienceDirect, and the Health Research and Development Information Network (HERDIN) combining MeSH and free-text terms.
32351873,This analysis highlights the agent of COVID-19 and the possible transmission.
32351873,The current research taking place to overcome this complex disease and the urgent need to develop improved therapeutics are also discussed.
32351873,Herein, we present an epidemiological overview of the currently available information on the treatment claimed to have helped to bring the situation under control.
32352309,<b>OBJECTIVE.</b> Because CT plays an important role in diagnosis, isolation, treatment, and effective evaluation of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), infection prevention and control management of CT examination rooms is important. <b>CONCLUSION.</b> We describe modifications to the CT examination process, strict disinfection of examination rooms, arrangement of waiting areas, and efforts to increase radiographers' awareness of personal protection made at our institution during the COVID-19 outbreak.
32352309,In addition, we discuss the potential of using artificial intelligence in imaging patients with contagious diseases.
32352401,Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV2), is an ongoing pandemic that has already affected millions of patients worldwide, and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality burden.
32352401,Although the clinical and laboratory characteristics of this illness have been reported in patients from China and Europe, data are scant in the United States.
32352401,Methods We extracted data regarding all patients hospitalized at our hospital with COVID-19 infection between March 1 and April 4, 2020.
32352401,Presenting signs and symptoms, laboratory and imaging findings, treatment, and complications were recorded from electronic medical records (EMRs).
32352401,The primary composite endpoint was admission to intensive care unit (ICU), shock, or death.
32352401,Results We had a total of 43 patients tested for COVID-19 at the emergency room (ER) or during hospitalization, 16 (37%) of whom were admitted with COVID-19 infection.
32352401,The mean age was 65.5 years and 75% were males.
32352401,The most common presenting symptoms were fever (94%), cough (88%), and dyspnea (81%).
32352401,A loss of smell and taste sensations were reported by three (19%) patients.
32352401,Low oxygen saturation was present in 38% of patients, whilst 31% were hypotensive on admission.
32352401,Hyponatremia (50%), elevated C-reactive protein (CRP; 100%), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; 80%) were common.
32352401,Acute renal failure, myocardial injury, and elevation in aminotransferases occurred in 69%, 19%, and 38% patients, respectively.
32352401,The primary composite endpoint occurred in 50% of patients.
32352401,A total of three patients died; all were aged 70 years or older.
32352401,Conclusions Laboratory abnormalities and acute renal failure were common in hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV2 infection in our center.
32352401,Admission to ICU and mechanical ventilation were common.
32352633,Important health resources are dedicated worldwide to the management of COVID-19.
32352633,This new disease, due to its large diffusion, may significantly hamper the prognosis of other pathologies, such as ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) because of (a) a possible direct negative impact and (b) shortage of first response medical resources and increased delays to reperfusion.
32352633,We report the case of a 68-year-old man admitted for anterior STEMI and asymptomatic COVID-19.
32352633,Due to extended transportation delays to a cathlab, he received intravenous fibrinolytic therapy, which failed.
32352633,Reperfusion was achieved with rescue coronary angioplasty, but the patient experienced two episodes of acute stent thrombosis at 2- and 36-hr following admission and despite optimal medical therapy.
32352633,He finally died because of cardiogenic shock.
32352633,This raises concerns about a possible increase in platelet aggregability associated with COVID-19 leading to an increased risk of stent thrombosis, particularly in the context of STEMI.
32352633,This pleads for the promotion of primary coronary angioplasty as the first-choice revascularization technique in this population and the use of new generation P2Y12 inhibitors.
32352633,In addition, the use of GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors may be considered in every STEMI patient with COVID-19 to prevent the risk of acute stent thrombosis.
32352637,To explore the potential association of obesity and other chronic diseases with severe outcomes, such as intensive care unit (ICU) admission and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), in patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
32352637,Retrospective cohort of 103 patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
32352637,Demographic data, past medical history and hospital course were collected and analyzed.
32352637,A multivariate logistic regression analysis was implemented to examine associations.
32352637,From February 17th to April 5th, 103 consecutive patients were hospitalized with COVID-19.
32352637,Among them, 41 patients (39.8%) were admitted to the ICU and 29 (70.7%) required (IMV).
32352637,The prevalence of obesity was 47.5% (49/103).
32352637,In a multivariate analysis, severe obesity (BMI ≥35 kg/m2) was associated with ICU admission (aOR 5.39; 95% CI:1.13-25.64).
32352637,Moreover, patients who required IMV, were more likely to have had heart disease (aOR 3.41; 95% CI:1.05-11.06), obesity (BMI=30-34.9 kg/m2) (aOR 6.85; 95% CI: 1.05-44.82) or severe obesity (BMI≥35 kg/m2) (aOR 9.99; 95% CI:1.39-71.69).
32352637,In our analysis, severe obesity (BMI ≥35 kg/m2) was associated with ICU admission, while history of heart disease and obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m2) were independently associated with the use of IMV.
32352637,Increased vigilance and aggressive treatment of patients with obesity and COVID-19 are warranted.
32352944,According to the Situation Report 65 of the World Health Organization of March 25, 2020, the COVID-19 incidence rate indicates 413 467 confirmed cases and 18 433 deaths.
32352944,Genetic diversification of the Corona virus has resulted in strains that cause severe respiratory tract infections in humans via drip and animal mediation.
32352944,S-proteins covering its surface, which bind to the cell receptor - angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) and transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2) are important in shaping virus activity.
32352944,The course of infection varies from mild to severe.
32352944,The ability to control infection is limited because there are no drugs that fully inhibit 2019-nCoV.
32352944,Interferon-alpha (5 million U twice daily by inhalation), lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily orally), as well as chloroquine (500 mg twice daily orally for 10 days) and azithromycin (500 mg twice per day) cause a milder course of the disease and reduce the duration of treatment.
32352944,The administration of glucocorticosteroids and research drugs (tocilizumab) is acceptable for massive infiltrative lesions in the pulmonary parenchyma causing severe lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
32352944,In the system operation it is necessary to create the socalled a safety matrix that would take into account the existing threat on the one hand and all available services and resources on the other.
32352944,Precise analysis and separation of individual tasks can enable the creation of a real crisis management plan.
32353441,Several studies have been published describing the clinical and radiographic findings on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia.
32353441,Therefore, there is currently a lack of pathologic data about its effects in intubated patients.
32353441,Pneumothorax may occur rarely and results from a combination of fibrotic parenchyma with prolonged high-pressure ventilation.
32353441,Chest drain represent the first line treatment.
32353441,However, in case of persistent pneumothorax, thoracoscopy and bleb resection may be a feasible option to reduce air leak and improve ventilation.
32353441,We report the cases of two COVID-19 patients successfully treated with thoracoscopy, bleb resection, and pleurectomy for persistent pneumothorax.
32353547,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which was previously known as 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), was first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019.
32353547,The disease evolved into a serious global emergency, leading to its declaration as a pandemic.
32353547,On the African continent, Nigeria is just experiencing the direct effects of this pandemic, having recorded her index case in February 2020, with an increasing number of cases every day and a current case fatality ratio of 0.03 as at 13 April 2020.
32353547,Although the recorded cases may seem low, it has been forecast that Africa will have some of the worst effects of this disease by the end of the pandemic.
32353547,Generally, African countries have fragile health systems and this remains a source of concern, especially in the event of increased outbreaks.
32353547,Nigeria's current national health systems cannot effectively respond to the growing needs of already infected patients requiring admission into intensive care units for acute respiratory diseases and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS COV-2) pneumonia.
32353547,This has grim implications for Nigeria, especially as increased cases loom that may require critical care.
32353547,Provision of quarantine or isolation facilities and availability of rapid diagnostic kits for fast and reliable testing and diagnosis of the disease can also be a challenge in Africa.
32353547,There is an urgent need to put into perspective these realities peculiar to Africa including Nigeria and explore available collective measures and interventions to address the COVID-19 pandemic.
32353597,The coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak is evolving rapidly worldwide.
32353597,The lungs are the target of the primary infection and patients with lung cancer seem to have a poor prognosis.
32353597,To our knowledge, this is the first reported investigation of a possible role of interleukin-17 target therapy in patients with lung cancer and concomitant severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 infection.
32353634,The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2 causes COVID-19, a pandemic threatening millions.
32353634,As protective immunity does not exist in humans and the virus is capable of escaping innate immune responses, it can proliferate, unhindered, in primarily infected tissues.
32353634,Subsequent cell death results in the release of virus particles and intracellular components to the extracellular space, which result in immune cell recruitment, the generation of immune complexes and associated damage.
32353634,Infection of monocytes/macrophages and/or recruitment of uninfected immune cells can result in massive inflammatory responses later in the disease.
32353634,Uncontrolled production of pro-inflammatory mediators contributes to ARDS and cytokine storm syndrome.
32353634,Antiviral agents and immune modulating treatments are currently being trialled.
32353634,Understanding immune evasion strategies of SARS-CoV2 and the resulting delayed massive immune response will result in the identification of biomarkers that predict outcomes as well as phenotype and disease stage specific treatments that will likely include both antiviral and immune modulating agents.
32353740,Novel coronavirus (NCoV-19), also known as SARS CoV-2, is a pathogen causing an emerging infection that rapidly increases in incidence and geographic range, is associated with the ever-increasing morbidity and mortality rates, and shows sever economic impact worldwide.
32353740,The WHO declares the NCoV-19 infection disease (COVID-19) a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020 and subsequently, on March 11, 2020, declared it a Global Pandemic.
32353740,Although some people infected with SARS CoV-2 have no symptoms, the spectrum of symptomatic infection ranges from mild to critical, with most COVID-19 infections being not severe.
32353740,The common mild symptoms include body aches, dry cough, fatigue, low-grade fever, nasal congestion, and sore throat.
32353740,More severe COVID-19 symptoms are typical of pneumonia, and upon progression, the patient's condition can worsen with severe respiratory and cardiac problems.
32353740,Currently, there is no drug or vaccine for curing patients.
32353740,It has been observed that people with challenged immunity are highly prone to SARS CoV-2 infection and least likely to recover.
32353740,Also, older adults and people of any age with serious underlying medical conditions might be at higher risk for severe forms of COVID-19.
32353740,We are suggesting here a strategy for the COVID-19 treatment that could be effective in curing the patients in the current scenario when no efficient medicine or Vaccine is currently available, and Clinicians solely depend upon the performing trials with drugs with known antiviral activities.
32353740,Our proposed strategy is based on the compilation of published scientific research and concepts.
32353740,The different published research indicates the success of a similar strategy in different physiological conditions, and such a strategy is widely studied at the cellular level and in animal models.
32353825,Epidemic prevention and control measures for the new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has achieved significant results.
32353825,As of 8 April 2020, 22,073 infection cases of COVID-19 among healthcare workers from 52 countries had been reported to WHO.
32353825,COVID-19 has strong infectivity, high transmission speeds, and causes serious infection among healthcare worker.
32353825,Burns are an acute-care condition, and burn treatment needs to be initiated before COVID-19 infection status can be excluded.
32353825,The key step to infection prevention is to identify risk points of infection exposure, strengthen the protection against those risk points, and formulate an appropriate diagnosis and treatment protocol.
32353825,Following an in-depth study of the latest literature on COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment, we reviewed the protocols surrounding hospitalization of patients with extensive burns (area≥50 %) in our hospital from February 2009 to February 2019 and, in accordance with the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19, developed an algorithm for protection during diagnosis and treatment of burns.
32353825,Therefore, the aspects of medical protection and the diagnosis and treatment of burns appear to be particularly important during the prevention and control of the COVID-19.
32353825,This algorithm was followed for 4 patients who received emergency treatment in February 2020 and were hospitalized.
32353825,All healthcare worker were protected according to the three-tiered protective measures, and there was no nosocomial infection.
32353825,During the COVID-19 epidemic, the early stages of emergency treatment for patients with extensive burns requiring the establishment of venous access for rehydration, endotracheal intubation or tracheostomy, wound treatment, and surgery are the risk points for exposure to infection.
32353825,The implementation of effective, appropriate-grade protection and formulation of practical treatment protocols can increase protection of healthcare worke and reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection exposure.
32353870,The novel 2019 strain of coronavirus is a source of profound morbidity and mortality worldwide.
32353870,Compared with recent viral outbreaks, COVID-19 infection has a relatively high mortality rate, the reasons for which are not entirely clear.
32353870,Furthermore, treatment options for COVID-19 infection are currently limited.
32353870,In this Perspective, we explore the contributions of the innate and adaptive immune systems to both viral control as well as toxicity during COVID-19 infections and offer suggestions to both understand and therapeutically modulate anti-COVID immunity.
32354030,On the 31 December 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) was informed of a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown origin detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.
32354030,The infection spread first in China and then in the rest of the world, and on the 11th of March, the WHO declared that COVID-19 was a pandemic.
32354030,Taking into consideration the mortality rate of COVID-19, about 5-7%, and the percentage of positive patients admitted to intensive care units being 9-11%, it should be mandatory to consider and take all necessary measures to contain the COVID-19 infection.
32354030,Moreover, given the recent evidence in different hospitals suggesting IL-6 and TNF-α inhibitor drugs as a possible therapy for COVID-19, we aimed to highlight that a dietary intervention could be useful to prevent the infection and/or to ameliorate the outcomes during therapy.
32354030,Considering that the COVID-19 infection can generate a mild or highly acute respiratory syndrome with a consequent release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6 and TNF-α, a dietary regimen modification in order to improve the levels of adiponectin could be very useful both to prevent the infection and to take care of patients, improving their outcomes.
32354181,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic aroused global public concern and became a major medical issue.
32354181,This study aims to investigate the global research routine and trends of coronavirus over the last twenty years based on the production, hotspots, and frontiers of published articles as well as to provide the global health system with a bibliometric reference.
32354181,The Web of Science core collection database was retrieved for coronavirus articles published from 1 January 2000 to 17 March 2020.
32354181,Duplicates and discrete papers were excluded.
32354181,Analysis parameters including time, regions, impact factors, and citation times were processed through professional software.
32354181,A total of 9043 coronavirus articles originated from 123 countries and were published in 1202 journals.
32354181,The USA contributed most articles (3101) followed by China (2230).
32354181,The research was published in specialized journals including the Journal of Virology.
32354181,Universities were the main institutions of science progress.
32354181,High-impact articles covered fields of basic science and clinical medicine.
32354181,There were two sharp increases in research yields after the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreaks.
32354181,International collaborations promoted study progress, and universities and academies act as the main force in coronavirus research.
32354181,More research on prevention and treatment is needed according to an analysis of term density.
32354369,The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak started in Wuhan, Hubei, China since Dec 2019 and cases of infection have been continuously reported in various countries.
32354369,It is now clear that the SARS-COV-2 coronavirus is transmissible from human to human.
32354369,Nucleic acid detection is considered as the gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
32354369,In this case report, we describe our experience in detection of SARS-COV-2 from a confirmed patient using nucleic acid test of bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid (BALF) samples but not nasopharyngeal swabs.
32354369,We present a case of severely ill SARS-COV-2 infected 46-year-old man with fever, coughing and chest tightness.
32354369,We performed viral detection using his BALF samples and imaging method (CT) for confirmation.
32354369,The patient received combination of interferonalfa-1b and ribavirin, lopinavir and ritonavir for antiviral treatment at different stages.
32354369,Other medication was also given to him in combination for anti-inflammation, intestinal microbial regulation, phlegm elimination, liver protection and pulmonary fibrosis prevention purposes.
32354369,We provided oxygen supply to him using BIPAP ventilator and high-flow humidification oxygen therapy instrument to facilitate respiration.
32354369,The patient was cured and discharged.
32354369,This case report described an effective supportive medication scheme to treat SARS-COV-2 infected patient and emphasized the necessity of detection of the viral genome using BALF samples and its significance in the diagnosis and prognosis of the disease.
32354491,Pandemic by the COVID-19 has found us unprotected to provide an adequate and rapid sanitary response.
32354491,The hospital network of our public health system has provided most of the resources for the treatment of patients affected by the infection.
32354491,Non-essential (non-priority) surgeries have been postponed.
32354491,The optimal and proportionate reestablishment of these non-priority surgeries can be a problem.
32354491,This article offers a technical and non-technical view of reestablishment non-priority surgeries from the perspective of abdominal wall surgery.
32354634,The outcome of SARS-CoV2 infection in patients who have received a kidney allograft and are being treated with immunosuppression is unclear.
32354634,We describe 20 kidney transplant recipients (median age 59 years [inter quartile range 51-64 years], median age of transplant 13 years [9-20 years], baseline eGFR 36.5 [23-47.5]) with SARS-CoV2 induced pneumonia.
32354634,At admission, all had immunosuppression withdrawn and were started on methylprednisolone 16 mg/day, all but one was commenced on antiviral therapy and hydroxychloroquine with doses adjusted for kidney function.
32354634,At baseline, all patients presented fever but only one complained of difficulty in breathing.
32354634,Half of patients showed chest radiographic evidence of bilateral infiltrates while the other half showed unilateral changes or no infiltrates.
32354634,During a median follow-up of seven days, 87% experienced a radiological progression and among those 73% required escalation of oxygen therapy.
32354634,Six patients developed acute kidney injury with one requiring hemodialysis.
32354634,Six of 12 patients were treated with tocilizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody to the IL-6 receptor.
32354634,Overall, five kidney transplant recipients died after a median period of 15 days [15-19] from symptom onset.
32354634,These preliminary findings describe a rapid clinical deterioration associated with chest radiographic deterioration and escalating oxygen requirement in renal transplant recipients with SARS-Cov2 pneumonia.
32354634,Thus, in this limited cohort of long-term kidney transplant patients, SARS-CoV-2 induced pneumonia is characterized by high risk of progression and significant mortality.
32354637,By 21 March 2020 infections related to the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 had affected people from 177 countries and caused 11,252 reported deaths worldwide.
32354637,Little is known about risk, presentation and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection in kidney transplantation recipients, who may be at high-risk due to long-term immunosuppression, comorbidity and residual chronic kidney disease.
32354637,Whilst COVID-19 is predominantly a respiratory disease, in severe cases it can cause kidney and multi-organ failure.
32354637,It is unknown if immunocompromised hosts are at higher risk of more severe systemic disease.
32354637,Therefore, we report on seven cases of COVID-19 in kidney transplant recipients (median age 54 (range 45-69), three females, from a cohort of 2082 managed transplant follow-up patients) over a six-week period in three south London hospitals.
32354637,Two of seven patients presented within three months of transplantation.
32354637,Overall, two were managed on an out-patient basis, but the remaining five required hospital admission, four in intensive care units.
32354637,All patients displayed respiratory symptoms and fever.
32354637,Other common clinical features included hypoxia, chest crepitation, lymphopenia and high C-reactive protein.
32354637,Very high D dimer, ferritin and troponin levels occurred in severe cases and likely prognostic.
32354637,Immunosuppression was modified in six of seven patients.
32354637,Three patients with severe disease were diabetic.
32354637,During a three week follow up one patient recovered, and one patient died.
32354637,Thus, our findings suggest COVID-19 infection in kidney transplant patients may be severe, requiring intensive care admission.
32354637,The symptoms are predominantly respiratory and associated with fever.
32354637,Most patients had their immunosuppression reduced and were treated with supportive therapy.
32354651,In France, the epidemic phase of COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) began in February 2020 and resulted in the implementation of emergency measures and a degradation in the organization of neuromuscular reference centers.
32354651,In this special context, the French Rare Health Care for Neuromuscular Diseases Network (FILNEMUS) has established guidance in an attempt to homogenize the management of neuromuscular (NM) patients within the French territory.
32354651,Hospitalization should be reserved for emergencies, the conduct of treatments that cannot be postponed, check-ups for which the diagnostic delay may result in a loss of survival chance, and cardiorespiratory assessments for which the delay could be detrimental to the patient.
32354651,A national strategy was adopted during a period of 1 to 2months concerning treatments usually administered in hospitalization.
32354651,NM patients treated with steroid/immunosuppressants for a dysimmune pathology should continue all of their treatments in the absence of any manifestations suggestive of COVID-19.
32354651,A frequently asked questions (FAQ) sheet has been compiled and updated on the FILNEMUS website.
32354651,Various support systems for self-rehabilitation and guided exercises have been also provided on the website.
32354651,In the context of NM diseases, particular attention must be paid to two experimental COVID-19 treatments, hydroxycholoroquine and azithromycin: risk of exacerbation of myasthenia gravis and QT prolongation in patients with pre-existing cardiac involvement.
32354651,The unfavorable emergency context related to COVID-19 may specially affect the potential for intensive care admission (ICU) for people with NMD.
32354651,In order to preserve the fairest medical decision, a multidisciplinary working group has listed the neuromuscular diseases with a good prognosis, usually eligible for resuscitation admission in ICU and, for other NM conditions, the positive criteria suggesting a good prognosis.
32354651,Adaptation of the use of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) make it possible to limit nebulization and continue using NIV in ventilator-dependent patients.
32354663,The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented global situation.
32354663,As assisted reproductive technology (ART) specialists, we should be cautious, carefully monitoring the situation while contributing by sharing novel evidence to counsel our patients, both pregnant women and would-be mothers.
32354663,Time to egg collection and drop-out rates are critical parameters for scheduling treatments once the curve of infections has peaked and plateaued in each country.
32354663,In order to reduce the values for these two parameters, infertile patients now require even more support from their IVF team: urgent oocyte collection for oncology patients must be guaranteed, and oocyte retrievals for women of advanced maternal age and/or reduced ovarian reserve cannot be postponed indefinitely.
32354663,This document represents the position of the Italian Society of Fertility and Sterility and Reproductive Medicine (SIFES-MR) in outlining ART priorities during and after this emergency.
32354734,Palliative care is an important component of the medical response to pandemics and other health emergencies.
32354734,The principles of palliative care do not change, but the practice of palliative care has to change as a result of factors such as greater demand and infection control measures.
32354734,This article makes suggestions for palliative care provision during a pandemic (in developed countries), based on a limited review of the literature and personal experience of the ongoing pandemic (COVID-19 infection).
32354798,We sought to explore the prevalence and immediate clinical implications of acute myocardial injury in a cohort of patients with covid-19 in a region of China where medical resources are less stressed than in Wuhan (the epicentre of the pandemic).
32354798,We prospectively assessed the medical records, laboratory results, chest CT images and use of medication in a cohort of patients presenting to two designated covid-19 treatment centres in Sichuan, China.
32354798,Outcomes of interest included death, admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), need for mechanical ventilation, treatment with vasoactive agents and classification of disease severity.
32354798,Acute myocardial injury was defined by a value of high-sensitivity troponin T (hs-TnT) greater than the normal upper limit.
32354798,A total of 101 cases were enrolled from January to 10 March 2020 (average age 49 years, IQR 34-62 years).
32354798,Acute myocardial injury was present in 15.8% of patients, nearly half of whom had a hs-TnT value fivefold greater than the normal upper limit.
32354798,Patients with acute myocardial injury were older, with a higher prevalence of pre-existing cardiovascular disease and more likely to require ICU admission (62.5% vs 24.7%, p=0.003), mechanical ventilation (43.5% vs 4.7%, p&lt;0.001) and treatment with vasoactive agents (31.2% vs 0%, p&lt;0.001).
32354798,Log hs-TnT was associated with disease severity (OR 6.63, 95% CI 2.24 to 19.65), and all of the three deaths occurred in patients with acute myocardial injury.
32354798,Acute myocardial injury is common in patients with covid-19 and is associated with adverse prognosis.
32354800,Since its recognition in December 2019, covid-19 has rapidly spread globally causing a pandemic.
32354800,Pre-existing comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease are associated with a greater severity and higher fatality rate of covid-19.
32354800,Furthermore, covid-19 contributes to cardiovascular complications, including acute myocardial injury as a result of acute coronary syndrome, myocarditis, stress-cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, and cardiac arrest.
32354800,The cardiovascular interactions of covid-19 have similarities to that of severe acute respiratory syndrome, Middle East respiratory syndrome and influenza.
32354800,Specific cardiovascular considerations are also necessary in supportive treatment with anticoagulation, the continued use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors, arrhythmia monitoring, immunosuppression or modulation, and mechanical circulatory support.
32354990,COVID-19 has rapidly become a major health emergency worldwide.
32354990,Patients with IBD are at increased risk of infection, especially when they have active disease and are taking immunosuppressive therapy.
32354990,The characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with IBD remain unclear.
32354990,This Italian prospective observational cohort study enrolled consecutive patients with an established IBD diagnosis and confirmed COVID-19.
32354990,Data regarding age, sex, IBD (type, treatments and clinical activity), other comorbidities (Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI)), signs and symptoms of COVID-19 and therapies were compared with COVID-19 outcomes (pneumonia, hospitalisation, respiratory therapy and death).
32354990,Between 11 and 29 March 2020, 79 patients with IBD with COVID-19 were enrolled at 24 IBD referral units.
32354990,Thirty-six patients had COVID-19-related pneumonia (46%), 22 (28%) were hospitalised, 7 (9%) required non-mechanical ventilation, 9 (11%) required continuous positive airway pressure therapy, 2 (3%) had endotracheal intubation and 6 (8%) died.
32354990,Four patients (6%) were diagnosed with COVID-19 while they were being hospitalised for a severe flare of IBD.
32354990,Age over 65 years (p=0.03), UC diagnosis (p=0.03), IBD activity (p=0.003) and a CCI score &gt;1 (p=0.04) were significantly associated with COVID-19 pneumonia, whereas concomitant IBD treatments were not.
32354990,Age over 65 years (p=0.002), active IBD (p=0.02) and higher CCI score were significantly associated with COVID-19-related death.
32354990,Active IBD, old age and comorbidities were associated with a negative COVID-19 outcome, whereas IBD treatments were not.
32354990,Preventing acute IBD flares may avoid fatal COVID-19 in patients with IBD.
32354990,Further research is needed.
32355107,Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is responsible for a global pandemic.
32355107,It is important to balance the need for access to healthcare services, including testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections (STIs).
32355107,STI programs must consider how to use limited resources and implement novel approaches to provide continued access to care.
32355450,This quasi-experimental study examined a guided learning approach towards the use of mobile devices and investigated the performance of language learners who were guided in the usage.
32355450,A total of 419 students from two faculties were invited to participate in this 8-week intervention, 155 participants in the control group and 264 in the experimental group.
32355450,In the experimental group, the researchers incorporated guided activities Module Intervention Model (MIM) using mobile devices into the ESL lessons whereas the control group lessons were without guided activities.
32355450,Participants from both groups were asked to record their daily mobile device use for activities related to English language learning using an online form.
32355450,These data were compared to the results of the tests conducted pre- and post-treatment.
32355450,At the end of the study, students who received guided language activities utilizing the mobile devices had significantly higher levels of language performance than control group students.
32355450,However, treatment group students who spent more time using mobile devices to learn the language did not display better performance compared to those who spent minimal time.
32355450,This finding re-established the importance of guided activities as intervention to facilitate students' learning and points to the need for curricular modernization and faculty development in the instructional use of technology.
32355450,Due to the increased need for online instruction precipitated by &quot;social distancing and isolation' required to overcome the coronavirus pandemic, the need for faculty to acquire skills in guided use of mobile devices for school-related learning is anticipated to be greater than ever.
32355509,The massive inflow of patients with COVID-19 requiring urgent care has overloaded hospitals in France and impacts the management of other patients.
32355509,Deferring hospitalization and non-urgent surgeries has become a priority for surgeons today in order to relieve the health care system.It is obviously not simple to reduce emergency surgery without altering the quality of care or leading to a loss of chance for the patient.
32355509,Acute appendicitis is a very specific situation and the prevalence of this disease leads us to reconsider this particular disease in the context of the COVID-19 crisis.
32355509,Indeed, while the currently recommended treatment for uncomplicated acute appendicitis is surgical appendectomy, the non-surgical alternative of medical management by antibiotic therapy alone has been widely evaluated by high-quality studies in the literature.
32355509,Insofar as the main limitation of exclusively medical treatment of uncomplicated acute appendicitis is the risk of recurrent appendicitis, this treatment option represents an alternative of choice to reduce the intra-hospital overload in this context of health crisis.The aim of this work is therefore to provide physicians and surgeons with a practical guide based on a review of the literature on the medical treatment of uncomplicated acute appendicitis in adults, to offer this alternative treatment to the right patients and under good conditions, especially when access to the operating room is limited or impossible.
32355564,We propose a likely contribution to severe COVID-19 morbidity by extracellular DNA in neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs).
32355564,Dornase alfa degrades extracellular DNA to reduce mucus rigidity and accumulation, and was associated with respiratory improvement in a first patient.
32355564,Dornase alfa should be considered for clinical trials in treatment of severe COVID-19.
32355607,The COVID-19 outbreak has resulted in uncertainty for patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases for several reasons.
32355607,They are concerned about their risk of developing COVID-19 as many are immune suppressed from their disease and/or treatment, whether they should stop their advanced therapies, if they will have a worse outcome if/when infected due to their underlying medication condition(s) and if they will have drug availability, especially with press (without much data) coverage suggesting hydroxychloroquine may be used in COVID-19 infection causing diversion of medication supply.
32355607,This article discusses how the pandemic affects people with systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases.
32355607,Preliminarily, articles seem to suggest that patients with rheumatic diseases may not have more infections from SARS-CoV-2 and similar outcomes to age and gender matched patients, but fear of rheumatic medications increasing their risk, drug shortages, and work exposure all are concerns for patients.
32355607,The long term effects of the pandemic in patients with rheumatic diseases will not be known until much later and likely include stressors flaring disease (fear, illness, job loss, social isolation), post-traumatic stress, flaring due to stopping medications, less physician visits with subsequent under-treatment, and increases in chronic concomitant fatigue, pain, fibromyalgia.
32355837,Recently, a new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has emerged as a respiratory infection with significant concern for global public health hazards.
32355837,With an initial suspicion of the animal to the human transmission for earlier cases, now the paradigm has shifted towards human to human transmission via droplets, contacts and/or through fomites. with each passing day, more and more confirmed cases are being reported worldwide which has alarmed the global authorities including World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China to take immediate action in order to reduce the transmission and subsequent mortalities associated with COVID-19 to as minimum as possible.
32355837,Unfortunately, like the previous Coronavirus outbreaks, there is no definite antiviral therapy for the treatment of confirmed cases and hence preventing ourselves from contracting 2019-nCoV is the best way to prevent it from becoming pandemic.
32355837,Herein, we aim to discuss the latest updates on the origin, genomic characteristics, diagnosis, treatment options and current efforts being made by international health organizations with regards to the 2019-nCoV outbreak.
32356252,SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus that emerged in 2019 and is causing the COVID-19 pandemic.
32356252,There is no current standard of care.
32356252,Clinicians need to be mindful of the toxicity of a wide variety of possibly unfamiliar substances being tested or repurposed to treat COVID-19.
32356252,The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has provided emergency authorization for the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine.
32356252,These two medications may precipitate ventricular dysrhythmias, necessitating cardiac and electrolyte monitoring, and in severe cases, treatment with epinephrine and high-doses of diazepam.
32356252,Recombinant protein therapeutics may cause serum sickness or immune complex deposition.
32356252,Nucleic acid vaccines may introduce mutations into the human genome.
32356252,ACE inhibitors and ibuprofen have been suggested to exacerbate the pathogenesis of COVID-19.
32356252,Here, we review the use, mechanism of action, and toxicity of proposed COVID-19 therapeutics.
32356301,The aim of the article is to point out the important role of prevention and reduction of mental stress in the general population and in sensitive groups in the context of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
32356301,This article includes the analysis and evaluation of studies and recommendations from organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) that have examined the psychological consequences of epidemics/pandemics on people and their impact on the further course.
32356301,Fear-related behaviors can adversely affect the course of epidemics.
32356301,Past outbreaks of infectious diseases (Ebola and Zika virus) have shown that maladaptive behavior, related to increased psychological stress and anxiety, can interfere with the implementation of treatment strategies and actions and can contribute to a further spread.
32356301,Hereby, strategies for dealing with infectious diseases, that include the suppression of fear, can trigger a vicious circle in which fear and suppression mutually reinforce each other.
32356301,The COVID-19 pandemic poses an immense challenge to governments, health systems and people, with an uncertain outcome, which is associated with a significant burden of mental health in the population.
32356301,In line with WHO recommendations, national guidelines and preventive measures should include the psychological consequences, the acceptance and normalization of fears and the promotion of resilience in the population in dealing with COVID-19 in order to counteract a further spread.
32356301,ZIEL: Das Ziel des Beitrages besteht darin, auf die bedeutsame Rolle der Prävention und Reduktion der psychischen Belastungen in der Allgemeinbevölkerung und in sensiblen Gruppen im Rahmen der Coronavirus-Krankheit-2019 (COVID-19) -Pandemie hinzuweisen.
32356301,Der vorliegende Beitrag umfasst die Analyse und Bewertung von Studien und Empfehlungen von Organisationen wie der Weltgesundheitsorganisation (WHO), die die bevölkerungsbezogenen psychischen Auswirkungen von Epi-/Pandemien und deren Einfluss auf den weiteren Verlauf untersucht haben.
32356301,Angstbedingte Verhaltensweisen können sich negativ auf den Verlauf von Epidemien auswirken.
32356301,Im Rahmen vergangener Ausbrüche von Infektionskrankheiten (Ebola- und Zika-Virus) konnte ermittelt werden, dass maladaptive Verhaltensweisen, bedingt durch erhöhte psychische Belastungen und Ängste, die Implementierung von Behandlungsstrategien und -maßnahmen beeinträchtigen und zu einer stärkeren Ausbreitung beitragen können.
32356301,Hierbei können Strategien im Umgang mit Infektionskrankheiten, die Verdrängung und Unterdrückung von Ängsten beinhalten, einen Teufelskreis auslösen, wobei Ängste und Verdrängung sich gegenseitig verstärken.
32356301,Die COVID-19-Pandemie stellt eine immense Herausforderung mit noch ungewissem Ausgang für Regierungen, Gesundheitssysteme und Menschen dar, die mit erheblichen Beeinträchtigungen der psychischen Gesundheit in der Bevölkerung verbunden ist.
32356301,Im Einklang mit Empfehlungen der WHO sollten nationale Leitlinien und präventive Maßnahmen die psychischen Auswirkungen, die Akzeptanz und Normalisierung von Ängsten und die Förderung von Resilienz in der Bevölkerung im Umgang mit COVID-19 umfassen, um einer weiteren Ausbreitung entgegenwirken zu können.
32356508,The 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has forced many healthcare organizations to divert efforts and resources to emergent patient care, delaying many elective oncological surgeries.
32356508,We investigated an association between delay in radical prostatectomy (RP) and oncological outcome.
32356508,This is a retrospective review of men with intermediate and high-risk prostate cancer (PC) in the National Cancer Database (NCDB) underdoing radical prostatectomy from 2010-2016.
32356508,Immediate RP was defined as RP within 3-months of diagnosis, while delayed RP was analyzed in 3-month intervals up to 12-months.
32356508,Multivariable logistic regression models were fit to test for associations between levels of delayed RP and outcomes of interest (adverse pathology, upgrading on RP, node positive disease, and post-RP secondary treatments) compared with men undergoing immediate RP.
32356508,We identified 128,062 men with intermediate- and high-risk PC treated with RP.
32356508,After adjustment, we did not appreciate a significant difference in odds of adverse pathology, upgrading, node positive disease, or post-RP secondary treatments between men treated with immediate RP and any level of delay up to 12 months.
32356508,Subgroup analysis of men with Grade group 4 and 5 PC did not demonstrate an association between delayed RP and worse oncological outcomes.
32356508,In the NCDB, delayed RP was not associated with early adverse oncological outcomes at RP.
32356508,These results may provide reassurance to patients and urologists balancing care in the current pandemic.
32356569,The unprecedented challenges posed by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic highlight the urgency for applying clinical pharmacology and model-informed drug development in (i) dosage optimization for COVID-19 therapies, (ii) approaching therapeutic dilemmas in clinical trial settings, and (iii) maximizing value of information from impacted non-COVID-19 trials.
32356569,More than ever, we have a responsibility for adaptive evidence synthesis with a Totality of Evidence mindset in this race against time across biomedical research, clinical practice, drug development, and regulation.
32356626,Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) may disproportionately affect people with cardiovascular disease.
32356626,Concern has been aroused regarding a potential harmful effect of angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) in this clinical context.
32356626,Using an observational database from 169 hospitals in Asia, Europe, and North America, we evaluated the relationship of cardiovascular disease and drug therapy with in-hospital death among hospitalized patients with Covid-19 who were admitted between December 20, 2019, and March 15, 2020, and were recorded in the Surgical Outcomes Collaborative registry as having either died in the hospital or survived to discharge as of March 28, 2020.
32356626,Of the 8910 patients with Covid-19 for whom discharge status was available at the time of the analysis, a total of 515 died in the hospital (5.8%) and 8395 survived to discharge.
32356626,The factors we found to be independently associated with an increased risk of in-hospital death were an age greater than 65 years (mortality of 10.0%, vs.
32356626,4.9% among those ≤65 years of age; odds ratio, 1.93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.60 to 2.41), coronary artery disease (10.2%, vs.
32356626,5.2% among those without disease; odds ratio, 2.70; 95% CI, 2.08 to 3.51), heart failure (15.3%, vs.
32356626,5.6% among those without heart failure; odds ratio, 2.48; 95% CI, 1.62 to 3.79), cardiac arrhythmia (11.5%, vs.
32356626,5.6% among those without arrhythmia; odds ratio, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.33 to 2.86), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (14.2%, vs.
32356626,5.6% among those without disease; odds ratio, 2.96; 95% CI, 2.00 to 4.40), and current smoking (9.4%, vs.
32356626,5.6% among former smokers or nonsmokers; odds ratio, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.29 to 2.47).
32356626,No increased risk of in-hospital death was found to be associated with the use of ACE inhibitors (2.1% vs.
32356626,6.1%; odds ratio, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.54) or the use of ARBs (6.8% vs.
32356626,5.7%; odds ratio, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.87 to 1.74).
32356626,Our study confirmed previous observations suggesting that underlying cardiovascular disease is associated with an increased risk of in-hospital death among patients hospitalized with Covid-19.
32356626,Our results did not confirm previous concerns regarding a potential harmful association of ACE inhibitors or ARBs with in-hospital death in this clinical context.
32356626,(Funded by the William Harvey Distinguished Chair in Advanced Cardiovascular Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital.).
32356628,There is concern about the potential of an increased risk related to medications that act on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in patients exposed to coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), because the viral receptor is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
32356628,We assessed the relation between previous treatment with ACE inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, beta-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, or thiazide diuretics and the likelihood of a positive or negative result on Covid-19 testing as well as the likelihood of severe illness (defined as intensive care, mechanical ventilation, or death) among patients who tested positive.
32356628,Using Bayesian methods, we compared outcomes in patients who had been treated with these medications and in untreated patients, overall and in those with hypertension, after propensity-score matching for receipt of each medication class.
32356628,A difference of at least 10 percentage points was prespecified as a substantial difference.
32356628,Among 12,594 patients who were tested for Covid-19, a total of 5894 (46.8%) were positive; 1002 of these patients (17.0%) had severe illness.
32356628,A history of hypertension was present in 4357 patients (34.6%), among whom 2573 (59.1%) had a positive test; 634 of these patients (24.6%) had severe illness.
32356628,There was no association between any single medication class and an increased likelihood of a positive test.
32356628,None of the medications examined was associated with a substantial increase in the risk of severe illness among patients who tested positive.
32356628,We found no substantial increase in the likelihood of a positive test for Covid-19 or in the risk of severe Covid-19 among patients who tested positive in association with five common classes of antihypertensive medications.
32356760,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is spreading rapidly around the world, resulting in a massive death toll.
32356760,Lung infection or pneumonia is the common complication of COVID-19, and imaging techniques, especially computed tomography (CT), have played an important role in diagnosis and treatment assessment of the disease.
32356760,Herein, we review the imaging characteristics and computing models that have been applied for the management of COVID-19.
32356760,CT, positron emission tomography - CT (PET/CT), lung ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been used for detection, treatment, and follow-up.
32356760,The quantitative analysis of imaging data using artificial intelligence (AI) is also explored.
32356760,Our findings indicate that typical imaging characteristics and their changes can play crucial roles in the detection and management of COVID-19.
32356760,In addition, AI or other quantitative image analysis methods are urgently needed to maximize the value of imaging in the management of COVID-19.
32356863,Administration of hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-associated pneumonia carries increased risk of corrected QT (QTc) prolongation and cardiac arrhythmias.
32356863,To characterize the risk and degree of QT prolongation in patients with COVID-19 in association with their use of hydroxychloroquine with or without concomitant azithromycin.
32356863,This was a cohort study performed at an academic tertiary care center in Boston, Massachusetts, of patients hospitalized with at least 1 positive COVID-19 nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction test result and clinical findings consistent with pneumonia who received at least 1 day of hydroxychloroquine from March 1, 2020, through April 7, 2020.
32356863,Change in QT interval after receiving hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin; occurrence of other potential adverse drug events.
32356863,Among 90 patients given hydroxychloroquine, 53 received concomitant azithromycin; 44 (48.9%) were female, and the mean (SD) body mass index was 31.5 (6.6).
32356863,Hypertension (in 48 patients [53.3%]) and diabetes mellitus (in 26 patients [28.9%]) were the most common comorbid conditions.
32356863,The overall median (interquartile range) baseline QTc was 455 (430-474) milliseconds (hydroxychloroquine, 473 [454-487] milliseconds vs hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, 442 [427-461] milliseconds; P &lt; .001).
32356863,Those receiving concomitant azithromycin had a greater median (interquartile range) change in QT interval (23 [10-40] milliseconds) compared with those receiving hydroxychloroquine alone (5.5 [-15.5 to 34.25] milliseconds; P = .03).
32356863,Seven patients (19%) who received hydroxychloroquine monotherapy developed prolonged QTc of 500 milliseconds or more, and 3 patients (3%) had a change in QTc of 60 milliseconds or more.
32356863,Of those who received concomitant azithromycin, 11 of 53 (21%) had prolonged QTc of 500 milliseconds or more and 7 of 53 (13 %) had a change in QTc of 60 milliseconds or more.
32356863,The likelihood of prolonged QTc was greater in those who received concomitant loop diuretics (adjusted odds ratio, 3.38 [95% CI, 1.03-11.08]) or had a baseline QTc of 450 milliseconds or more (adjusted odds ratio, 7.11 [95% CI, 1.75-28.87]).
32356863,Ten patients had hydroxychloroquine discontinued early because of potential adverse drug events, including intractable nausea, hypoglycemia, and 1 case of torsades de pointes.
32356863,In this cohort study, patients who received hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of pneumonia associated with COVID-19 were at high risk of QTc prolongation, and concurrent treatment with azithromycin was associated with greater changes in QTc.
32356863,Clinicians should carefully weigh risks and benefits if considering hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, with close monitoring of QTc and concomitant medication usage.
32356908,We have applied mathematical modeling to investigate the infections of the ongoing coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus.
32356908,We first validated our model using the well-studied influenza viruses and then compared the pathogenesis processes between the two viruses.
32356908,The interaction between host innate and adaptive immune responses was found to be a potential cause for the higher severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients.
32356908,Specifically, the timing mismatch between the two immune responses has a major impact on disease progression.
32356908,The adaptive immune response of the COVID-19 patients is more likely to come before the peak of viral load, while the opposite is true for influenza patients.
32356908,This difference in timing causes delayed depletion of vulnerable epithelial cells in the lungs in COVID-19 patients while enhancing viral clearance in influenza patients.
32356908,Stronger adaptive immunity in COVID-19 patients can potentially lead to longer recovery time and more severe secondary complications.
32356908,Based on our analysis, delaying the onset of adaptive immune responses during the early phase of infections may be a potential treatment option for high-risk COVID-19 patients.
32356908,Suppressing the adaptive immune response temporarily and avoiding its interference with the innate immune response may allow the innate immunity to more efficiently clear the virus.
32356910,The recent emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has reassessed the usefulness of historic convalescent plasma transfusion (CPT).
32356910,This review was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of CPT therapy in COVID-19 patients based on the publications reported till date.
32356910,To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review on convalescent plasma on clinically relevant outcomes in individuals with COVID-19.
32356910,PubMed, EMBASE, and Medline databases were searched upto 19 April 2020.
32356910,All records were screened as per the protocol eligibility criteria.
32356910,We included five studies reporting CPT to COVID-19 patients.
32356910,The main findings from available data are as follows: (a) Convalescent plasma may reduce mortality in critically ill patients, (b) Increase in neutralizing antibody titers and disappearance of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was observed in almost all the patients after CPT therapy, and (c) Beneficial effect on clinical symptoms after administration of convalescent plasma.
32356910,Based on the limited scientific data, CPT therapy in COVID-19 patients appears safe, clinically effective, and reduces mortality.
32356910,Well-designed large multicenter clinical trial studies should be conducted urgently to establish the efficacy of CPT to COVID-19 patients.
32356955,Novel coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19) is an escalating, highly infectious global pandemic that is quickly overwhelming healthcare systems.
32356955,This has implications on standard cardiac care for ST-elevation myocardial infarctions (STEMIs).
32356955,In the setting of anticipated resource scarcity in the future, we are forced to reconsider fibrinolytic therapy in our management algorithms.
32356955,We encourage clinicians to maintain a high level of suspicion for STEMI mimics, such as myopericarditis which is a known, not infrequent, complication of COVID-19 disease.
32356955,Herein, we present a pathway developed by a multidisciplinary panel of stakeholders at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center for the management of STEMI in suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients.
32357072,<b> <i>Objective:</i> </b> Previous studies on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were based on information from the general population.
32357072,We aimed to further clarify the clinical characteristics of diabetes with COVID-19. <i> <b>Methods:</b> </i> Twenty-eight patients with diabetes and COVID-19 were enrolled from January 29, 2020, to February 10, 2020, with a final follow-up on February 22, 2020.
32357072,Epidemiologic, demographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment, and outcome data were analyzed. <i> <b>Results:</b> </i> The average age of the 28 patients was 68.6 ± 9.0 years.
32357072,Most (75%) patients were male.
32357072,Only 39.3% of the patients had a clear exposure of COVID-19.
32357072,Fever (92.9%), dry cough (82.1%), and fatigue (64.3%) were the most common symptoms, followed by dyspnea (57.1%), anorexia (57.1%), diarrhea (42.9%), expectoration (25.0%), and nausea (21.4%).
32357072,Fourteen patients were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).
32357072,The hemoglobin A1c level was similar between ICU and non-ICU patients.
32357072,ICU patients had a higher respiratory rate, higher levels of random blood glucose, aspartate transaminase, bilirubin, creatine, N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide, troponin I, D-dimers, procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, ferritin, interleukin (IL)-2R, IL-6, and IL-8 than non-ICU patients.
32357072,Eleven of 14 ICU patients received noninvasive ventilation and 7 patients received invasive mechanical ventilation.
32357072,Twelve patients died in the ICU group and no patients died in the nonICU group. <i> <b>Conclusion:</b> </i> ICU cases showed higher rates of organ failure and mortality than non-ICU cases.
32357072,The poor outcomes of patients with diabetes and COVID-19 indicated that more supervision is required in these patients. <b>(Endocr Pract. 2020;26:xxx-xxx)</b>.
32357074,The severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV-2 is an emerging viral pathogen responsible for the global coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic resulting in significant human morbidity and mortality.
32357074,Based on preliminary clinical reports, hypoxic respiratory failure complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome is the leading cause of death.
32357074,Further, septic shock, late-onset cardiac dysfunction, and multiorgan system failure are also described as contributors to overall mortality.
32357074,Although extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and other modalities of mechanical cardiopulmonary support are increasingly being utilized in the treatment of respiratory and circulatory failure refractory to conventional management, their role and efficacy as support modalities in the present pandemic are unclear.
32357074,We review the rapidly changing epidemiology, pathophysiology, emerging therapy, and clinical outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019; and based on these data and previous experience with artificial cardiopulmonary support strategies, particularly in the setting of infectious diseases, provide consensus recommendations from American Society for Artificial Internal Organs.
32357074,Of note, this is a living document, which will be updated periodically, as additional information and understanding emerges.
32357281,In India, oral cancer is the most common head and neck cancer (HNC) in men, mainly caused by the consumption of smoked and smokeless tobacco.
32357281,During the current pandemic, delaying surgery for even 1 or 2 months may lead to more extensive surgery or inoperability, where only supportive care can be provided.
32357281,Being semi-emergent in nature, treatment for these patients is currently on hold or delayed in most centers across the country.
32357281,This study was conducted to assess the impact of COVID-19 pandemic and inability of the health system to treat HNC in a timely fashion and how surgeons are coping to this emergent situation.
32357281,This article highlights the situation in India, a country burdened with one of the highest incidence rates of HNC.
32357288,The prolonged lockdown of health facilities providing non-urgent gamete cryopreservation-as currently recommended by many reproductive medicine entities and regulatory authorities due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic will be detrimental for subgroups of male infertility patients.
32357288,We believe the existing recommendations should be promptly modified and propose that the same permissive approach for sperm banking granted for men with cancer is expanded to other groups of vulnerable patients.
32357288,These groups include infertility patients (eg, azoospermic and cryptozoospermic) undergoing medical or surgical treatment to improve sperm quantity and quality, as well as males of reproductive age affected by inflammatory and systemic auto-immune diseases who are about to start treatment with gonadotoxic drugs or who are under remission.
32357288,In both scenarios, the &quot;fertility window&quot; may be transitory; postponing diagnostic semen analysis and sperm banking in these men could compromise the prospects of biological parenthood.
32357288,Moreover, we provide recommendations on how to continue the provision of andrological services in a considered manner and a safe environment.
32357288,Our opinion is timely and relevant given the fact that fertility services are currently rated as of low priority in most countries.
32357380,The COVID-19 pandemic has raised controversies regarding safe and effective care of head and neck cancer patients.
32357380,It is unknown how much the pandemic has changed surgeon practice.
32357380,A questionnaire was distributed to head and neck surgeons assessing opinions related to treatment and concerns for the safety of patients, self, family, and staff.
32357380,A total of 67 head and neck surgeons responded during the study period.
32357380,Surgeons continued to recommend primary surgical treatment for oral cavity cancers.
32357380,Respondents were more likely to consider non-surgical therapy for patients with early glottic cancers and HPV-mediated oropharynx cancer.
32357380,Surgeons were least likely to be concerned for their own health and safety and had the greatest concern for their resident trainees.
32357380,This study highlights differences in the willingness of head and neck surgeons to delay surgery or alter plans during times when hospital resources are scarce and risk is high.

32357503,The current outbreak of COVID-19 severe respiratory disease, which started in Wuhan, China, is an ongoing challenge, and a major threat to public health that requires surveillance, prompt diagnosis, and research efforts to understand this emergent pathogen and to develop an effective response.
32357503,Due to the scientific community's efforts, there is an increasing body of published studies describing the virus' biology, its transmission and diagnosis, its clinical features, its radiological findings, and the development of candidate therapeutics and vaccines.
32357503,Despite the decline in postmortem examination rate, autopsy remains the gold standard to determine why and how death happens.
32357503,Defining the pathophysiology of death is not only limited to forensic considerations; it may also provide useful clinical and epidemiologic insights.
32357503,Selective approaches to postmortem diagnosis, such as limited postmortem sampling over full autopsy, can also be useful in the control of disease outbreaks and provide valuable knowledge for managing appropriate control measures.
32357503,In this scenario, we strongly recommend performing full autopsies on patients who died with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection, particularly in the presence of several comorbidities.
32357503,Only by working with a complete set of histological samples obtained through autopsy can one ascertain the exact cause(s) of death, optimize clinical management, and assist clinicians in pointing out a timely and effective treatment to reduce mortality.
32357503,Death can teach us not only about the disease, it might also help with its prevention and, above all, treatment.
32357545,New coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) treatments and vaccines are under development to combat COVID-19.
32357545,Several approaches are being used by scientists for investigation, including (1) various small molecule approaches targeting RNA polymerase, 3C-like protease, and RNA endonuclease; and (2) exploration of antibodies obtained from convalescent plasma from patients who have recovered from COVID-19.
32357545,The coronavirus genome is highly prone to mutations that lead to genetic drift and escape from immune recognition; thus, it is imperative that sub-strains with different mutations are also accounted for during vaccine development.
32357545,As the disease has grown to become a pandemic, B-cell and T-cell epitopes predicted from SARS coronavirus have been reported.
32357545,Using the epitope information along with variants of the virus, we have found several variants which might cause drifts.
32357545,Among such variants, 23403A&gt;G variant (p.D614G) in spike protein B-cell epitope is observed frequently in European countries, such as the Netherlands, Switzerland, and France, but seldom observed in China.
32357553,In January 2020, Chinese health agencies reported an outbreak of a novel coronavirus-2 (CoV-2) which can lead to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).
32357553,The virus, which belongs to the coronavirus family (SARS-CoV-2), was named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO).
32357553,Full-length genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 showed 79.6% sequence identity to SARS-CoV, with 96% identity to a bat coronavirus at the whole-genome level.
32357553,COVID-19 has caused over 133,000 deaths and there are over 2 million total confirmed cases as of April 15th, 2020.
32357553,Current treatment plans are still under investigation due to a lack of understanding of COVID-19.
32357553,One potential mechanism to slow disease progression is the use of antiviral drugs to either block the entry of the virus or interfere with viral replication and maturation.
32357553,Currently, antiviral drugs, including chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, and lopinavir/ritonavir, have shown effective inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
32357553,Due to the high dose needed and narrow therapeutic window, many patients are experiencing severe side effects with the above drugs.
32357553,Hence, repurposing these drugs with a proper formulation is needed to improve the safety and efficacy for COVID-19 treatment.
32357553,Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are a family of natural carriers in the human body.
32357553,They play a critical role in cell-to-cell communications.
32357553,EVs can be used as unique drug carriers to deliver protease inhibitors to treat COVID-19.
32357553,EVs may provide targeted delivery of protease inhibitors, with fewer systemic side effects.
32357553,More importantly, EVs are eligible for major aseptic processing and can be upscaled for mass production.
32357553,Currently, the FDA is facilitating applications to treat COVID-19, which provides a very good chance to use EVs to contribute in this combat.
32357575,The older Italian population is posing a challenge in the number of deaths for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32357575,According to previous data from China, pre-existing health conditions dramatically increase the risk of dying from COVID-19.
32357575,The presence of multiple diseases in older patients may be considered as a mark of frailty, which increases the person's vulnerability to stress and impairs the multisystemic compensatory effort to restore homeostasis.
32357575,The clinical complexity associated with the management of frailty may increase the risk of complications during infection as well as the lack of the early recognition of atypical symptoms.
32357575,There is an urgent need to share expertise and clinical management skills with geriatricians as well as the need for early diagnosis to start treatment at the earliest convenience in the community, with the aim to avoid the collapse of intensive care units.
32357975,While some risk factors have been identified, the reasons for the disparities in disease progression with COVID-19 are unclear, with some patients developing progressive and severe disease while in others the course is benign.
32357975,Given this sense of randomness, and in the absence of a definitive treatment, medical professionals can feel helpless.
32357975,It is useful to remember how much can be done to affect the trajectory of illness, even without a 'magic bullet'.
32357975,With evidence emerging that late presentation is directly associated with increased mortality, we make the case for increased vigilance in the community and earlier intervention.
32357994,Cancer patients are presumed to be at increased risk from COVID-19 infection fatality due to underlying malignancy, treatment-related immunosuppression, or increased comorbidities.
32357994,A total of 218 COVID-19 positive patients from March 18th-April 8th, 2020 with a malignant diagnosis were identified.
32357994,A total of 61 (28%) cancer patients died from COVID-19 with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 37% (20/54) for hematologic malignancies and 25% (41/164) for solid malignancies. 6/11 (55%) lung cancer patients died from COVID-19 disease.
32357994,Increased mortality was significantly associated with older age, multiple comorbidities, need for ICU support, and elevated levels of D-Dimers, LDH and lactate on multivariable analysis.
32357994,Age-adjusted CFRs in cancer patients compared to non-cancer patients at our institution and NYC reported a significant increase in case fatality for cancer patients.
32357994,These data suggest the need for proactive strategies to reduce likelihood of infection and improve early identification in this vulnerable patient population.
32358230,A novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was first reported in December 2019 in China and was soon declared a pandemic by World Health Organization.
32358230,Many elective and non-essential surgeries were postponed worldwide in an effort to minimize spread of disease as well as to conserve resources.
32358230,Our goal with this article is to review current practice guidelines in setting of the COVID-19 pandemic, based on available data and literature.
32358230,Websites pertaining to surgical and medical societies, and government agencies were reviewed, along with recently published literature to identify recommendations related to COVID-19 and plastic surgery procedures.
32358230,Clinical practice modifications are recommended during the pandemic, in outpatient and perioperative settings.
32358230,Use of personal protective equipment is critical for aerosol generating procedures such as surgery in the head and neck area.
32358230,Care for trauma and malignancy should continue during the pandemic, however definitive reconstruction could be delayed for select cases.
32358230,Specific recommendations were made for surgical treatment of cancer, trauma and semi-urgent reconstructive procedures based on available data and literature.
32358230,The risk and benefit of each reconstructive procedure should be carefully analyzed in relation to necessary patient care, minimized COVID-19 spread, protection of health care personnel and utilization of resources.
32358230,Recommendations in this manuscript should be taken in the context of each institute's resources and prevalance of COVID-19 in the region.
32358230,It should be emphasized that the guidelines provided are a snapshot of current practices and are subject to change as the pandemic continues to evolve.
32358232,The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 is an emerging viral pathogen responsible for the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID)-19 pandemic resulting in significant human morbidity and mortality.
32358232,Based on preliminary clinical reports, hypoxic respiratory failure complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome is the leading cause of death.
32358232,Further, septic shock, late-onset cardiac dysfunction, and multiorgan system failure are also described as contributors to overall mortality.
32358232,Although extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and other modalities of mechanical cardiopulmonary support are increasingly being utilized in the treatment of respiratory and circulatory failure refractory to conventional management, their role and efficacy as support modalities in the present pandemic are unclear.
32358232,We review the rapidly changing epidemiology, pathophysiology, emerging therapy, and clinical outcomes of COVID-19; and based on these data and previous experience with artificial cardiopulmonary support strategies, particularly in the setting of infectious diseases, provide consensus recommendations from ASAIO.
32358232,Of note, this is a &quot;living document,&quot; which will be updated periodically, as additional information and understanding emerges.
32358234,The novel coronavirus 2 pandemic is causing widespread disruption in everyday life necessitating urgent and radical adaptations in operating procedures at Nuclear Medicine facilities.
32358234,The potential for causing severe illness, COVID-19, calls for strict observance of preventive measures aimed to mitigate the spread of the virus.
32358234,The threat of COVID-19 is particularly serious as there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral therapy.
32358234,Further complications are introduced by shortages of personal protective equipment for healthcare workers who have direct contact with patients and effective testing to identify infected patients, raising the need for delaying some testing and therapies.
32358234,Certain vulnerable segments of the general population have been identified (advanced age and certain comorbidities), which should heighten further their preventive efforts.
32358234,Therefore, this guidance is intended to be operationalized depending on a facility's specific needs and local disease prevalence.
32358406,The cystic features of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) found on computed tomography (CT) have not yet been reported in the published literature.
32358406,We report the cystic chest CT findings of 2 patients confirmed to have COVID-19-related pneumonia.
32358406,A 38-year-old man and a 35-year-old man diagnosed with severe COVID-19 pneumonia were admitted to the intensive care unit.
32358406,Chest CT findings showed multiple cysts in ground-glass opacities (bilaterally) with/without pneumothorax.
32358406,The cysts had a smooth inner wall.
32358406,The patients continued to be given oxygen by mask and received antitussive, phlegm-dispelling treatment.
32358406,At follow up, there was a reduction in the number of multiple cystic lesions on CT.
32358406,To date, 1 patient was discharged from hospital, while the other had been transferred to the rehabilitation department.
32358406,COVID-19 may independently result in pulmonary cyst formation and pneumothorax; the application of a ventilator may be another causative factor.
32358568,Since early 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has a massive impact on health care systems worldwide.
32358568,Patients with malignant diseases are assumed to be at increased risk for a worse outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and therefore, guidance regarding prevention and management of the infection as well as safe administration of cancer-therapy is required.
32358568,Here, we provide recommendations for the management of patients with malignant disease in the times of COVID-19.
32358568,These recommendations were prepared by an international panel of experts and then consented by the EHA Scientific Working Group on Infection in Hematology.
32358568,The primary aim is to enable clinicians to provide optimal cancer care as safely as possible, since the most important protection for patients with malignant disease is the best-possible control of the underlying disease.
32358689,Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus recently isolated from humans.
32358689,SARS-CoV-2 was discovered to be the pathogen responsible for a cluster of pneumonia cases associated with severe respiratory disease that occurred in December 2019 in China.
32358689,This novel pulmonary infection, formally called Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), has spread rapidly in China and beyond.
32358689,On 8 March 2020, the number of Italians with SARS-CoV-2 infection was 7375 with a 48% hospitalization rate.
32358689,At present, chest-computed tomography imaging is considered the most effective method for the detection of lung abnormalities in early-stage disease and quantitative assessment of severity and progression of COVID-19 pneumonia.
32358689,Although chest X-ray (CXR) is considered not sensitive for the detection of pulmonary involvement in the early stage of the disease, we believe that, in the current emergency setting, CXR can be a useful diagnostic tool for monitoring the rapid progression of lung abnormalities in infected patients, particularly in intensive care units.
32358689,In this short communication, we present our experimental CXR scoring system that we are applying to hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia to quantify and monitor the severity and progression of this new infectious disease.
32358689,We also present the results of our preliminary validation study on a sample of 100 hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection for whom the final outcome (recovery or death) was available.
32358691,To improve the risk stratification of patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), an experimental chest X-ray (CXR) scoring system for quantifying lung abnormalities was introduced in our Diagnostic Imaging Department.
32358691,The purpose of this study was to retrospectively evaluate correlations between the CXR score and the age or sex of Italian patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.
32358691,Between March 4, 2020, and March 18, 2020, all CXR reports containing the new scoring system were retrieved.
32358691,Only hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled.
32358691,For each patient, age, sex, and the CXR report containing the highest score were considered for the analysis.
32358691,Patients were also divided into seven groups according to age.
32358691,Nonparametric statistical tests were used to examine the relationship between the severity of lung disease and the age or sex.
32358691,783 Italian patients (532 males and 251 females) with SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled.
32358691,The CXR score was significantly higher in males than in females only in groups aged 50 to 79 years.
32358691,A significant correlation was observed between the CXR score and age in both males and females.
32358691,Males aged 50 years or older and females aged 80 years or older with coronavirus disease 2019 showed the highest CXR score (median ≥ 8).
32358691,Males aged 50 years or older and females aged 80 years or older showed the highest risk of developing severe lung disease.
32358691,Our results may help to identify the highest-risk patients and those who require specific treatment strategies.
32358791,we read with great interest the article entitled &quot;SARS-CoV-2 infection in a psoriatic patient treated with IL-23 inhibitor&quot; published by Messina F. and Piaserico S. in the JEADV.<sup>1</sup> This is the first report of COronaVIrus DIsease 2019 (COVID-19) in a psoriatic patient treated with a biologic.
32358791,Whilst the authors reported an infection that occurred during therapy with an IL-23 inhibitor, we would like to briefly report one that occurred during therapy with an IL-17 inhibitor.
32358833,In this review, we identify opportunities for drug discovery in the treatment of COVID-19 and in so doing, provide a rational roadmap whereby pharmacology and pharmacologists can mitigate against the global pandemic.
32358833,We assess the scope for targetting key host and viral targets in the mid-term, by first screening these targets against drugs already licensed; an agenda for drug re-purposing, which should allow rapid translation to clinical trials.
32358833,A simultaneous, multi-pronged approach using conventional drug discovery methodologies aimed at discovering novel chemical and biological means targetting a short-list of host and viral entities should extend the arsenal of anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents.
32358833,This longer-term strategy would provide a deeper pool of drug choices for future-proofing against acquired drug resistance.
32358833,Second, there will be further viral threats, which will inevitably evade existing vaccines.
32358833,This will require a coherent therapeutic strategy which pharmacology and pharmacologists are best placed to provide.
32358880,With the arrival of the coronavirus disease (SARS-CoV-2) in the United States, care practice paradigms have drastically changed.
32358880,Data from China suggest that the new virus poses additional risks as case fatality of patients with cancer was higher at 5.6% compared to 2.3% of the general population.
32358880,There are three proposed major strategies to address care for patients with cancer in this SARS-CoV-2 pandemic with postponing treatment for those with stable cancer, increasing personal protection provisions for patients with cancer, and increasing monitoring if a patient becomes infected with SARS-CoV-2.
32358880,In this present commentary, we discuss the unique mental health challenges and burdens of patients with head and neck cancer in the times of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and approaches to mitigate these stressors through telemedicine to reduce future burdens to the patient and the health care system.
32358890,COVID-19 disease is a highly contagious and particularly popular problem in all countries.
32358890,A variety of repurposed drugs and investigational drugs such as remdesivir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, ritonavir, lopinavir, interferon-beta, and other potential drugs have been studied for COVID19 treatment.
32358890,We reviewed the potential dermatological side-effects of these drugs.
32358954,To explore and describe the current literature surrounding bacterial/fungal co-infection in patients with coronavirus infection.
32358954,MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science were searched using broad based search criteria relating to coronavirus and bacterial co-infection.
32358954,Articles presenting clinical data for patients with coronavirus infection (defined as SARS-1, MERS, SARS-COV-2, and other coronavirus) and bacterial/fungal co-infection reported in English, Mandarin, or Italian were included.
32358954,Data describing bacterial/fungal co-infections, treatments, and outcomes were extracted.
32358954,Secondary analysis of studies reporting antimicrobial prescribing in SARS-COV-2 even in the absence of co-infection was performed. 1007 abstracts were identified.
32358954,Eighteen full texts reported bacterial/fungal co-infection were included.
32358954,Most studies did not identify or report bacterial/fungal coinfection (85/140;61%). 9/18 (50%) studies reported on COVID-19, 5/18 (28%) SARS-1, 1/18 (6%) MERS, and 3/18 (17%) other coronavirus.For COVID-19, 62/806 (8%) patients were reported as experiencing bacterial/fungal co-infection during hospital admission.
32358954,Secondary analysis demonstrated wide use of broad-spectrum antibacterials, despite a paucity of evidence for bacterial coinfection.
32358954,On secondary analysis, 1450/2010 (72%) of patients reported received antimicrobial therapy.
32358954,No antimicrobial stewardship interventions were described.For non-COVID-19 cases bacterial/fungal co-infection was reported in 89/815 (11%) of patients.
32358954,Broad-spectrum antibiotic use was reported.
32358954,Despite frequent prescription of broad-spectrum empirical antimicrobials in patients with coronavirus associated respiratory infections, there is a paucity of data to support the association with respiratory bacterial/fungal co-infection.
32358954,Generation of prospective evidence to support development of antimicrobial policy and appropriate stewardship interventions specific for the COVID-19 pandemic are urgently required.
32358956,A novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has recently emerged and caused the rapid spread of COVID-19 worldwide.
32358956,We did a retrospective study and included COVID-19 patients admitted to Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University between February 1 and February 29, 2020.
32358956,Antibody assay was conducted to detect COVID-19 envelope protein E and nucleocapsid protein N antigen. 112 patients were recruited with symptoms of fever, cough, fatigue, myalgia, and diarrhoea.
32358956,All patients underwent antibody tests.
32358956,Fifty-eight (51.79%) were positive for both IgM and IgG, 7 (6.25%) were negative for both antibodies, 1 (0.89%) was positive for only IgM, and 46 (41.07%) were positive for only IgG.
32358956,IgM antibody appeared within a week post disease onset, and lasted for one month and gradually decreased, while IgG antibody was produced 10 days after infection, and lasted for a longer time.
32358956,However, no significant difference in level of IgM and IgG antibody between positive and negative patients of nucleic acid test after treatment was found.
32358956,Our results indicate that serological tests could be powerful approach for the early diagnosis of COVID-19.
32359035,No agent has yet been proven to be effective for the treatment of patients with severe COVID-19.
32359035,We conducted a pilot prospective open, single-arm multicentre study on off-label use of tocilizumab (TCZ) involving 63 hospitalised adult patients (56 males, age 62.6±12.5) with severe COVID-19.
32359035,Clinical and laboratory parameters were prospectively collected at baseline, day 1, 2, 7 and 14.
32359035,No moderate-to-severe adverse events attributable to TCZ were recorded.
32359035,We observed a significant improvement in the levels of ferritin, C-reactive protein, D-dimer.
32359035,The ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen (Pa02) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fi02) improved (mean±SD Pa02/Fi02 at admission: 152±53; at day 7: 283.73±115.9, at day 14: 302.2±126, p&lt;0.05).
32359035,The overall mortality was 11%; D-dimer level at baseline, but not IL-6 levels were predictors of mortality.
32359035,TCZ administration within 6 days from admission in the hospital was associated with an increased likelihood of survival (HR 2.2 95%CI 1.3-6.7, p&lt;0.05).
32359035,In hospitalised adult patients with severe COVID-19, TCZ could be a safe option.
32359035,An improvement in respiratory and laboratory parameters was observed.
32359035,Future controlled trials in patients with severe illness are urgently needed to confirm the definite benefit with IL-6 target therapy.
32359182,we read with great interest the article entitled &quot;Should SARS-CoV-2 influence immunosuppressive therapy for autoimmune blistering diseases?
32359182,&quot; published by Di Altobrando A. et al. in the JEADV.
32359182,This is the first report of COronaVIrus DIsease 2019 (COVID-19) in a patient affected by autoimmune blistering disease (ABD) during immunosuppressive treatment (i.e. azathioprine).
32359182,The authors conclude that it is crucial to learn of more cases of ABD patients under immunosuppressive treatment who have developed COVID-19, in order to better quantify the risk of infection under immunosuppressive therapy.
32359201,The natural history of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 is extremely variable, ranging from asymptomatic or mild infection, mainly in children, to multi-organ failure, eventually fatal, mainly in the eldest.
32359201,We propose here the first model, explaining how the outcome of first, crucial 10-15 days after infection, hangs on the balance between the cumulative dose of viral exposure and the efficacy of the local innate immune response (natural IgA and IgM antibodies, Mannose Binding Lectin ).
32359201,If SARS-CoV-2 runs the blockade of this innate immunity and spreads from the upper airways to the alveoli in the early phases of the infections, it can replicate with no local resistance, causing pneumonia and releasing high amounts of antigens.
32359201,The delayed and strong adaptive immune response (high affinity IgM and IgG antibodies) that follows, causes severe inflammation and triggers mediator cascades (complement, coagulation, and cytokine storm) leading to complications often requiring intensive therapy and being, in some patients, fatal.
32359201,Low-moderate physical activity can still be recommended.
32359201,However, extreme physical activity and hyperventilation during the incubation days and early stages of COVID-19, facilitates early direct penetration of high numbers of virus particles in the lower airways and the alveoli, without impacting on the airway's mucosae covered by neutralizing antibodies.
32359201,This allows the virus bypassing the efficient immune barrier of the upper airways mucosa in already infected, young and otherwise healthy athletes.
32359201,In conclusion, whether the virus or the adaptative immune response reach the lungs first, is a crucial factor deciding the fate of the patient.
32359201,This &quot;quantitative and time-sequence dependent&quot; model has several implications for prevention, diagnosis, and therapy of COVID-19 at all ages.
32359203,The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has presented clinicians with a difficult therapeutic dilemma.
32359203,With supportive care as the current mainstay of treatment, the fatality rate of COVID-19 is 6.9%.
32359203,There are currently several trials assessing the efficacy of different antivirals as treatment.
32359203,Of these, chloroquine (CQ) and its derivative hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have garnered the most attention.
32359203,In this study, the literature currently available on CQ and HCQ as treatment of COVID-19 was surveyed using EMBASE, PubMed, Cochrane Library, MedRxiv, and one clinical trial registry.
32359203,Upon gathering published and preprint trials, risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool 2.0.
32359203,There are currently seven completed clinical trials and 29 registered clinical trials focusing on HCQ or CQ as a therapeutic avenue for COVID-19.
32359203,Of these, five of seven trials have shown favorable outcomes for patients using CQ or HCQ and two of seven have shown no change compared to control.
32359203,However, all seven trials carried varying degrees of bias and poor study design.
32359203,There are currently not enough data available to support the routine use of HCQ and CQ as therapies for COVID-19.
32359203,Pending further results from more extensive studies with more stringent study parameters, clinicians should defer from routine use of HCQ and CQ.
32359203,There are several clinical trials currently under way with results expected soon.
32359205,Data on patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) who have had 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) disease (COVID-19) are lacking.
32359205,To report the clinical characteristics, including gastrointestinal symptoms, of COVID-19 in IBD patients, and to assess the risk of COVID-19 in IBD.
32359205,This case series included consecutive IBD patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19.
32359205,Age-adjusted cumulative incidences were compared with the general population in the Madrid region.
32359205,Through April 8, 12 patients of 1918 IBD patients were diagnosed of COVID-19.
32359205,The average age was 52 years, 75% of the patients were female, and 58.3% had Crohn's disease.
32359205,Seven patients (58%) were on maintenance treatment with immunomodulators/biologics, of these 4 with combined therapy (33%).
32359205,Eight patients (66%) required hospitalization (1 intensive care unit admission, and 2 deaths), and 4 patients were isolated at home.
32359205,Nine patients had diarrhoea ranging between 4-10 loose stools per day (mean 5.4, SD 1.6).
32359205,In 5 patients (42%) diarrhoea was a presenting symptom.
32359205,In 2 patients, diarrhoea was the only symptom at debut.
32359205,Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was 6.1 per 1000 IBD patients.
32359205,IBD patients had a lower adjusted incidence ratio of COVID-19 (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.70-0.77; p&lt;0.001), and a similar associated mortality ratio (OR 0.95, 95% CI: 0.84-1.06; p=0.36), compared with the general population.
32359205,IBD patients do not have an increased risk of COVID-19 and associated mortality compared with the general population.
32359205,In many IBD patients diarrhoea was a presenting symptom, and sometimes, was the only symptom at onset of COVID-19.
32359223,The rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has created unprecedented challenges for the medical and surgical healthcare systems.
32359223,With the ongoing need for urgent and emergency colorectal surgery, including surgery for colorectal cancer, several questions pertaining to operating room (OR) utilization and techniques needed to be rapidly addressed.
32359223,This manuscript discusses knowledge related to the critical considerations of patient and caregiver safety relating to personal protective equipment (PPE) and the operating room environment.
32359223,During the COVID-19 pandemic, additional personal protective equipment (PPE) may be required contingent upon local availability of COVID-19 testing and the incidence of known COVID-19 infection in the respective community.
32359223,In addition to standard COVID-19 PPE precautions, a negative-pressure environment, including an OR, has been recommended, especially for the performance of aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs).
32359223,Hospital spaces ranging from patient wards to ORs to endoscopy rooms have been successfully converted from standard positive-pressure to negative-pressure spaces.
32359223,Another important consideration is the method of surgical access; specifically, minimally invasive surgery with pneumoperitoneum is an AGP and thus must be carefully considered.
32359223,Current debate centres around whether it should be avoided in patients known to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 or whether it can be performed under precautions with safety measures in place to minimize exposure to aerosolized virus particles.
32359223,Several important lessons learned from pressurized intraperitoneal aerosolized chemotherapy procedures are demonstrated to help improve our understanding and management.
32359223,This paper evaluates the issues surrounding these challenges including the OR environment and AGPs which are germane to surgical practices around the world.
32359223,Although there is no single universally agreed upon set of answers, we have presented what we think is a balanced cogent description of logical safe approaches to colorectal surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32359771,As the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) global pandemic rages across the globe, the race to prevent and treat this deadly disease has led to the &quot;off-label&quot; repurposing of drugs such as hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir, which have the potential for unwanted QT-interval prolongation and a risk of drug-induced sudden cardiac death.
32359771,With the possibility that a considerable proportion of the world's population soon could receive COVID-19 pharmacotherapies with torsadogenic potential for therapy or postexposure prophylaxis, this document serves to help health care professionals mitigate the risk of drug-induced ventricular arrhythmias while minimizing risk of COVID-19 exposure to personnel and conserving the limited supply of personal protective equipment.
32359788,As the world faces the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, extensive efforts have been applied to identify effective therapeutic agents.
32359788,Convalescent plasma collected from recovered patients has been a therapeutic modality employed for over a hundred years for various infectious pathogens.
32359788,Specifically, it has been used in the treatment of many viral infections with varying degrees of clinical efficacy.
32359788,As we consider the use of convalescent plasma in the battle against this new strain of coronavirus, it is prudent to review what is known from past experiences.
32359788,Accordingly, the aim of this review is to examine in detail studies of convalescent plasma used during previous viral outbreaks and pandemics with particular focus on hemorrhagic fevers, influenza, and other coronaviruses.
32359788,The concluding sections of this review address the potential use of convalescent plasma during the present-day SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, not only insofar as its clinical benefit but also the steps required to make convalescent plasma treatments readily available for an exponentially growing patient population.
32359788,By the end, the authors hope to address the extent to which convalescent plasma represents a realistic therapeutic approach, or a distraction from other potentially useful treatments.
32359846,COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was declared a global pandemic in March 2020.
32359846,It has impacted the world medically, financially, politically and socially, with countries such as China and Italy adopting a full lockdown of their cities to mitigate the transmission.
32359846,The current mortality rate is 5.4%, with 1 056 159 people infected worldwide.
32359846,The disease is reminiscent of SARS in 2002, from which the healthcare system of Singapore has garnered many lessons and applied them in the current climate.
32359846,As a result of the high transmissibility of the virus, hospitals in Singapore have reduced clinic loads and elective treatments to halt propagation of the virus and also to allow redistribution of healthcare workforce to the frontline.
32359846,Cancer patients, who are often immunocompromised, are at risk of contracting the disease and becoming seriously ill.
32359846,At the same time, delaying treatment such as radiotherapy in cancer patients can be detrimental.
32359846,Here, we describe our experience as a large radiation oncology department in Singapore, including the challenges we encountered and how we managed our patient flow.
32359937,The purpose of this study was to highlight the importance of timely brachytherapy treatment for patients with gynecologic, breast, and prostate malignancies, and provide a framework for brachytherapy clinical practice and management in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
32359937,We review amassing evidence to help guide the management and timing of brachytherapy for gynecologic, breast, and prostate cancers.
32359937,Where concrete data could not be found, peer-reviewed expert opinion is provided.
32359937,There may be a significant negative impact on oncologic outcomes for patients with gynecologic malignancies who have a delay in the timely completion of therapy.
32359937,Delay of prostate or breast cancer treatment may also impact oncologic outcomes.
32359937,If a treatment delay is expected, endocrine therapy may be an appropriate temporizing measure before delivery of radiation therapy.
32359937,The use of shorter brachytherapy fractionation schedules will help minimize patient exposure and conserve resources.
32359937,Brachytherapy remains a critical treatment for patients and may shorten treatment time and exposure for some.
32359937,Reduced patient exposure and resource utilization is important during COVID-19.
32359937,Every effort should be made to ensure timely brachytherapy delivery for patients with gynecologic malignancies, and endocrine therapy may help temporize treatment delays for breast and prostate cancer patients.
32359937,Physicians should continue to follow developing institutional, state, and federal guidelines/recommendations as challenges in delivering care during COVID-19 will continue to evolve.
32360053,In late 2019, an outbreak of a new coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was detected in Wuhan, China.
32360053,A great percentage of patients with this disease developed symptoms of dry cough, malaise, and a high fever.
32360053,During this time, several patients requiring assessment and treatment of endodontic emergencies were directed to the School and Hospital of Stomatology at Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.
32360053,We examined the characteristics of these patients.
32360053,A total of 96 patients with a mean age of 42.24 ± 18.32 years visited the general and emergency department of the School and Hospital of Stomatology at Wuhan University because of endodontic emergencies during the peak period of February 22 to March 2, 2020.
32360053,Patient information was collected and organized by date of visit, sex, age, and systemic disease history.
32360053,Body temperature was measured and acquired for each patient, a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemiologic investigation questionnaire was given to each patient, an endodontic diagnosis was determined for the offending tooth, and a verbal numerical rating scale (VNRS) was used to record pain levels.
32360053,Of the total patient visits during this period, 50.26% of visits were for endodontic treatment.
32360053,No patients had a fever (&gt;37.2°C).
32360053,One patient with a confirmed COVID-19 history was admitted after recovery.
32360053,Three admitted patients had been exposed to confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients.
32360053,Twelve admitted patients (12.5%) with a mean age of 62.42 ± 13.77 years had a history of systemic diseases.
32360053,The most common age group for endodontic emergencies was 45-64 years (30.21%), and patients of this group showed a significantly higher mean VNRS score compared with that of the 6- to 19-year age group and the 20- to 34-year age group (P &lt; .05).
32360053,The majority of endodontic emergency diagnoses were diseases of symptomatic irreversible pulpitis (53.10%).
32360053,Patients who were diagnosed with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis, symptomatic apical periodontitis, and acute apical abscess showed a significantly higher mean VNRS score than that of other groups (P &lt; .05).
32360053,Endodontic emergencies, with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis being the most common, consist of a much higher proportion of dental emergencies in a COVID-19 high-risk area than normally.
32360053,Vital pulp therapy can advantageously reduce treatment time, resulting in a reduced risk of infection for vital pulp cases.
32360053,Rubber dams, personal protective equipment, and patient screening are of great importance during the COVID-19 outbreak in protecting clinicians.
32360133,Coronavirus disease 2019 has been recently classified as pandemic infection by the World Health Organization.
32360133,Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are invited to follow the national recommendations as any other person.
32360133,It is unclear whether a more aggressive clinical course might develop in asymptomatic COVID-19 infected subjects during biological therapy and current evidence does not support treatment suspension.
32360133,However, during pandemic, the start of treatment with immunosuppressive drugs and biologics should be postponed whenever possible and based on an individual risk assessment.
32360133,When clinical conditions and the disease activity do not allow a treatment delay, before starting a biological therapy, screening of IBD patients for COVID-19 active infection by RT-PCR should be advisable, even in absence of clinical suspicion.
32360133,Serum antibody testing, when available, could provide evidence of infection as well as identify patients already immune to the disease.
32360181,The 2019 Coronavirus infection (COVID-19) caused by a novel strain of coronavirus was detected in China in December 2019, and declared a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020.
32360181,Community pharmacists have an important role in supporting the local health emergency preparedness and response arrangements.
32360181,To investigate pharmacists and pharmacy students' awareness and source of their information regard the management of the coronavirus pandemic, and their perspective of their role during this emergent situation.
32360181,This descriptive cross-sectional online survey study was conducted in Jordan during the COVID-19 outbreak (from 15 to 30 March 2020).
32360181,A validated online questionnaire addressing participants' current awareness about epidemics/pandemics and COVID-19, source of information and their perspectives of their role.
32360181,Data were analyzed using statistical package for social science (SPSS).
32360181,Participants (n = 726) had a mean age of 26.9 (8.0) years with 71.9% females.
32360181,Pharmacy students made 35.3% of the sample while the rest were pharmacists.
32360181,Only 54.3% of participants believed that they got enough education about epidemics/pandemics, and 94.6% of them follow on the latest coronavirus updates on treatments, and that is mainly from the media (59.5%) followed by the World Health Organization reports (58.7%) and then the published researches (57%).
32360181,Awareness score (out of 20) of pharmacists (n = 470) was significantly higher (p &lt; 0.001) than that of students (n = 256).
32360181,Better Awareness scores were also associated with higher age of participants, graduating from a public versus a private university, and attending more educational workshops.
32360181,The majority of pharmacists and pharmacy students reported that they have a major role in the management of epidemics/pandemics through the community pharmacies but the majority follow on the latest coronavirus updates from the media.
32360181,This fact rings bills considering the numerous conflicting messages publicized during the pandemic through the media.
32360182,There is an urgent need to identify antivirals to curtail the COVID-19 pandemic.
32360182,Herein, we report the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 to recombinant human interferons α and β (IFNα/β).
32360182,Treatment with IFN-α or IFN-β at a concentration of 50 international units (IU) per milliliter reduces viral titers by 3.4 log or over 4 log, respectively, in Vero cells.
32360182,The EC<sub>50</sub> of IFN-α and IFN-β treatment is 1.35 IU/ml and 0.76 IU/ml, respectively, in Vero cells.
32360182,These results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is more sensitive than many other human pathogenic viruses, including SARS-CoV.
32360182,Overall, our results demonstrate the potential efficacy of human Type I IFN in suppressing SARS-CoV-2 infection, a finding which could inform future treatment options for COVID-19.
32360231,The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is a global public health emergency, and new therapeutics are needed.
32360231,This article reports the potential drug target and mechanism of action of Arbidol (umifenovir) to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32360231,Molecular dynamics and structural analysis were used to show how Arbidol targets the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and impedes its trimerization, which is key for host cell adhesion and hijacking, indicating the potential of Arbidol to treat COVID-19.
32360231,It is hoped that knowledge of the potential drug target and mechanism of action of Arbidol will help in the development of new therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2.
32360238,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic presents unique challenges to Asian countries like Singapore with a predominantly Confucian culture.
32360238,Palliative care providers play an important role in supporting their patients and family members in these difficult times.
32360420,Clinical intervention in patients with corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has demonstrated a strong upregulation of cytokine production in patients who are critically ill with SARS-CoV2-induced pneumonia.
32360420,In a retrospective study of 41 patients with COVID-19, most patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection developed mild symptoms, whereas some patients later developed aggravated disease symptoms, and eventually passed away because of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), as a consequence of a severe cytokine storm.
32360420,Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infected pneumonia were first published January 30<sup>th</sup>, 2020; these guidelines recommended for the first time that cytokine monitoring should be applied in severely ill patients to reduce pneumonia related mortality.
32360420,The cytokine storm observed in COVID-19 illness is also an important component of mortality in other viral diseases, including SARS, MERS and influenza.
32360420,In view of the severe morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 pneumonia, we review the current understanding of treatment of human coronavirus infections from the perspective of a dysregulated cytokine and immune response.
32360432,COVID-19 infection has been reported to be related with an increased risk of thrombotic complications because of the hypercoagulability state and inflammation.
32360432,At the moment, no reports are available regarding thrombosis of prosthetic vascular grafts.
32360432,We present the case of a patient with COVID-19-related pneumonia, who suffered from the acute thrombosis of a previously implanted aortic graft.
32360432,A 67-year-old male patient, who had undergone open repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm with a bifurcated graft 6 years before, was admitted to the emergency department with high fever for a week without cough or dyspnea.
32360432,Thoracic ultrasound showed signs of bilateral interstitial pneumonia, and the Sars-Cov-2 swab was positive.
32360432,Antiretroviral therapy and prophylactic low molecular weight heparin treatment were initiated.
32360432,Owing to the progressive impairment of the respiratory function, the patient was intubated after eight days from the admission, the day after he showed signs of bilateral acute limb ischemia.
32360432,A duplex ultrasound demonstrated the complete thrombosis of the aortic graft without flow at the femoral level.
32360432,An urgent angio-computed tomography scan for revascularization purpose was requested, but the patient died on the arrival in the radiological suite.
32360432,Acute thrombosis of vascular prosthetic grafts is a possible, catastrophic complication of COVID-19 infection.
32360432,In COVID-19 patients with prosthetic graft, an aggressive antithrombotic treatment could be considered to prevent such an event.
32360439,Acute stroke remains a medical emergency even during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32360439,Most patients with COVID-19 present with constitutional and respiratory symptoms, some patients present with atypical symptoms including gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, or neurological symptoms.
32360439,Here we present a series of four COVID-19 patients with acute stroke as a presenting symptom.
32360439,We searched the hospital databases for patients presenting with acute strokes and suspected COVID-19 features.
32360439,All patients that had imaging confirmed strokes and PCR confirmed COVID-19 were included in the study.
32360439,Patients admitted to the hospital with PCR confirmed COVID-19 disease whose hospital course was complicated with acute stroke while inpatient were excluded from the study.
32360439,Retrospective patient data were obtained from electronic medical records.
32360439,Informed consent was obtained.
32360439,We identified four patients presenting with imaging confirmed acute strokes and PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32360439,We elucidate the clinical characteristics, imaging findings, and the clinical course.
32360439,Timely assessment and hyperacute treatment is the key to minimize mortality and morbidity of patients with acute stroke.
32360439,Stroke teams should be wary of the fact that COVID-19 patients can present with cerebrovascular accidents and dawn appropriate personal protective equipment in every suspected patient.
32360439,Further studies are urgently needed for a comprehensive understanding of the neurological pathology of COVID-19 and its effects on the nervous system.
32360444,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has rapidly become epidemic in Italy and other European countries.
32360444,The disease spectrum ranges from asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic presentations to acute respiratory failure.
32360444,At the present time the absolute number of severe cases requiring ventilator support is reaching or even surpassing the intensive care unit bed capacity in the most affected regions and countries.
32360444,To narratively summarize the available literature on the management of COVID-19 in order to combine current evidence and frontline opinions and to provide balanced answers to pressing clinical questions.
32360444,Inductive PubMed search for publications relevant to the topic.
32360444,The available literature and the authors' frontline-based opinion are summarized in brief narrative answers to selected clinical questions, with a conclusive statement provided for each answer.
32360444,Many off-label antiviral and anti-inflammatory drugs are currently being administered to patients with COVID-19.
32360444,Physicians must be aware that, as they are not supported by high-level evidence, these treatments may often be ethically justifiable only in those worsening patients unlikely to improve only with supportive care, and who cannot be enrolled onto randomized clinical trials.
32360444,Access to well-designed randomized controlled trials should be expanded as much as possible because it is the most secure way to change for the better our approach to COVID-19 patients.
32360479,To analyze the diagnosis and treatment of patients with chronic renal failure complicated with novel coronavirus pneumonia, and to evaluate the effect of blood purification technology on the treatment and prognosis of such patients.
32360479,Two COVID-19 cases undergoing hemodialysis with chronic renal failure were retrospectively analysed in our hospital.
32360479,Two COVID-19 patients were admitted to hospital due to cough, with or without fever.
32360479,Laboratory tests showed decreased lymphocyte count, elevated PCT, IL-10, IL-6, TNF-α, IL-2R, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I, NT-proBNP, creatinine, and urea nitrogen.
32360479,Chest CT scan showed multiple blurred plaques and patchy shadows in both patients.
32360479,Two patients received continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) every other day for 4-6 h everytime, in addition to the standard treatment.
32360479,After CVVHDF, not only cytokines were reduced, but also liver function and cardiac function significantly improved.
32360479,Both patients did not develop severe pneumonia.
32360479,They were discharged on March 1, 2020 when meeting the discharge criteria.
32360479,Two COVID-19 patients on maintenance hemodialysis discharged after a month of hospitalization.
32360479,The removal of cytokines through blood purification technology may be beneficial for the recovery of COVID-19 patients.
32360481,Since December 2019, new COVID-19 outbreaks have occurred and spread around the world.
32360481,However, the clinical characteristics of patients in other areas around Wuhan, Hubei Province are still unclear.
32360481,In this study, we performed epidemiological and clinical characteristics analysis on these regional cases.
32360481,We retrospectively investigated COVID-19 patients positively confirmed by nucleic acid Q-PCR at Taihe Hospital from January 16 to February 4, 2020.
32360481,Their epidemiological, clinical manifestations, and imaging characteristics were analysed.
32360481,Among the 73 patients studied, 12.3 % developed symptoms after returning to Shiyan from Wuhan, and 71.2 % had a history of close contact with Wuhan personnel or confirmed cases.
32360481,Among these patients, 9 cases were associated with family clustering.
32360481,The first main symptoms presented by these patients were fever (84.9 %) and cough (21.9 %).
32360481,The longest incubation period was 26 days, and the median interval from the first symptoms to admission was 5 days.
32360481,Of the patients, 67.1 % were originally healthy people with no underlying diseases, others mostly had common comorbidities including hypertension (12.3 %) and diabetes (5.5 %), 10.9 % were current smokers, 30.1 % had low white blood cell counts and 45.2 % showed decreased lymphocytes at the first time of diagnosis.
32360481,CT scans showed that multiple patchy ground glass shadows outside of the patient lungs were commonly observed, and a single sub-pleural sheet of ground glass shadow with enhanced vascular bundles was also found located under the pleura.
32360481,Patient follow-up to February 14 presented 38.4 % severe cases and 2.7 % critical cases.
32360481,After follow-up, the parameter of lymphocyte counts below 0.8 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L cannot be used to predict severe and critical groups from the ordinary group, and a lower proportion of smokers and higher proportion of diabetes patients occur in the poor outcome group.
32360481,Other co-morbidities are observed but did not lead to poor outcomes.
32360481,The epidemiological characteristics of patients in the area around Wuhan, such as Shiyan, at first diagnosis are described as follows: Patients had histories of Wuhan residences in the early stage and family clustering in the later period.
32360481,The incubation period was relatively long, and the incidence was relatively hidden, but the virulence was relatively low.
32360481,The initial diagnosis of the patients was mostly ordinary, and the percentage of critical patients who evolved into the ICU during follow-up is 2.7 %, which is lower than the 26.1 % reported by Wuhan city.
32360481,According to the Shiyan experience, early diagnosis with multiple swaps of the Q-PCR test and timely treatment can reduce the death rate.
32360481,Diabetes could be one of the risk factors for progression to severe/critical outcomes.
32360481,No evidence exists that smoking protects COVID-19 patients from developing to severe/critical cases, and the absolute number of lymphocytes at initial diagnosis could not predict the progression risk from severe to critical condition.
32360481,Multivariate regression analysis should be used to further guide the allocation of clinical resources.
32360482,Taking anti-inflammatory drugs, including non-steroidal (NSAIDs), during Covid-19 infection, how much is risky?
32360482,The French Minister of Health, who has raised an alarm on a possible risk deriving from the use of ibuprofen for the control of fever and other symptoms during the disease, opened the debate a few days ago.
32360482,In this paper we examine available evidence from preclinical and clinical studies that had analysed the role of COX in the inflammatory process and the effects of NSAIDs in patients with infections.
32360482,Most of the published studies that suggested not protective effects of NSAIDs were mainly performed in vitro or on animals.
32360482,Therefore, their meaning in humans is to be considered with great caution.
32360482,Based also on data suggesting protective effects of NSAIDs, we concluded that currently there is no evidence suggesting a correlation between NSAIDs and a worsening of infections.
32360482,Further studies will be certainly needed to better define the role of NSAIDs and particularly COX2 inhibitors in patients with infections.
32360482,In the meantime, we must wait for results of the revision started by the PRAC on May 2019 on the association ibuprofen/ketoprofen​​​​​​ and worsening of infections.
32360482,Since nowadays no scientific evidence establishes a correlation between NSAIDS and worsening of COVID-19, patients should be advice against any NSAIDs self-medication when COVID-19 like symptoms are present.
32360500,Chinese pediatricians are working on the front line to fight COVID-19.
32360500,They have published a great amount of first-hand clinical data.
32360500,Collecting their data and forming a large sample for analysis is more conducive to the recognition, prevention and treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 in children.
32360500,The epidemic prevention and control experience of Chinese pediatricians should be shared with the world.
32360500,By searching Chinese and English literature, the data of 406 children with COVID-19 in China were analyzed.
32360500,It was found that the clustered incidence of children's families is a dynamic transmission feature; the incidence is low; asymptomatic infections and mild cases account for 44.8%, with only 7 cases of critical illness; laboratory examination of lymphocyte counts is not reduced, as it is for adults; chest CT findings are less severe than those for adults.
32360500,These presentations are the clinical features of COVID-19 in children.
32360500,Only 55 of the 406 cases were tested by anal swab for virus nucleic acid, 45 of which were positive, accounting for 81.8% of stool samples.
32360500,There are more children than adults with asymptomatic infections, milder conditions, faster recovery, and a better prognosis.
32360500,Some concealed morbidity characteristics also bring difficulties to the early identification, prevention and control of COVID-19.
32360500,COVID-19 screening is needed in the pediatric fever clinic, and respiratory and digestive tract nucleic acid tests should be performed.
32360500,Efforts should be made to prevent children from becoming a hidden source of transmission in kindergartens, schools or families.
32360500,Furthermore, China's experience in treating COVID-19 in children has led to faster recovery of sick children.
32360578,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is currently accelerating.
32360578,Patients with locally advanced NSCLC (LA-NSCLC) may require treatment in locations where resources are limited, and the prevalence of infection is high.
32360578,Patients with LA-NSCLC frequently present with comorbidities that increase the risk of severe morbidity and mortality from COVID-19.
32360578,These risks may be further increased by treatments for LA-NSCLC.
32360578,Although guiding data is scarce, we present an expert thoracic oncology multidisciplinary (radiation oncology, medical oncology, surgical oncology) consensus of alternative strategies for the treatment of LA-NSCLC during a pandemic.
32360578,The overarching goals of these approaches are the following: (1) reduce the number of visits to a health care facility, (2) reduce the risk of exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2, (3) attenuate the immunocompromising effects of lung cancer therapies, and (4) provide effective oncologic therapy.
32360578,Patients with resectable disease can be treated with definitive nonoperative management if surgical resources are limited or the risks of perioperative care are high.
32360578,Nonoperative options include chemotherapy, chemoimmunotherapy, and radiation therapy with sequential schedules that may or may not affect long-term outcomes in an era in which immunotherapy is available.
32360578,The order of treatments may be on the basis of patient factors and clinical resources.
32360578,Whenever radiation therapy is delivered without concurrent chemotherapy, hypofractionated schedules are appropriate.
32360578,For patients who are confirmed to have COVID-19, usually, cancer therapies may be withheld until symptoms have resolved with negative viral test results.
32360578,The risk of severe treatment-related morbidity and mortality is increased for patients undergoing treatment for LA-NSCLC during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32360578,Adapting alternative treatment strategies as quickly as possible may save lives and should be implemented through communication with the multidisciplinary cancer team.
32360580,Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread worldwide through person-to-person contact, causing a public health emergency of international concern.
32360580,At present, there is no specific antiviral treatment recommended for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32360580,Liu Shen capsule (LS), a traditional Chinese medicine, has been proven to have a wide spectrum of pharmacological properties, such as anti-inflammatory, antiviral and immunomodulatory activities.
32360580,However, little is known about the antiviral effect of LS against SARS-CoV-2.
32360580,Herein, the study was designed to investigate the antiviral activity of SARS-CoV-2 and its potential effect in regulating the host's immune response.
32360580,The inhibitory effect of LS against SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells was evaluated by using the cytopathic effect (CPE) and plaque reduction assay.
32360580,The number of virions of SARS-CoV-2 was observed under transmission electron microscope after treatment with LS.
32360580,Proinflammatory cytokine expression levels upon SARS-CoV-2 infection in Huh-7 cells were measured by real-time quantitative PCR assays.
32360580,The results showed that LS could significantly inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells, and reduce the number of virus particles and it could markedly reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, IL-8, CCL-2/MCP-1 and CXCL-10/IP-10) production at the mRNA levels.
32360580,Moreover, the expression of the key proteins in the NF-κB/MAPK signaling pathway was detected by western blot and it was found that LS could inhibit the expression of p-NF-κB p65, p-IκBα and p-p38 MAPK, while increasing the expression of IκBα.
32360580,These findings indicate that LS could inhibit SARS-CoV-2 virus infection via downregulating the expression of inflammatory cytokines induced virus and regulating the activity of NF-κB/MAPK signaling pathway in vitro, making its promising candidate treatment for controlling COVID-19 disease.
32360583,The rapidly progressing of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has become a global concern.
32360583,This meta-analysis aimed at evaluating the efficacy and safety of current option of therapies for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) besides COVID-19, in an attempt to identify promising therapy for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected patients.
32360583,We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), China Science and Technology Journal Database (VIP), and WANFANG DATA for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), prospective cohort, and retrospective cohort studies that evaluated therapies (hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir-based therapy, and ribavirin-based therapy, etc.) for SARS, MERS, and COVID-19.
32360583,The primary outcomes were mortality, virological eradication and clinical improvement, and secondary outcomes were improvement of symptoms and chest radiography results, incidence of acute respiratory disease syndrome (ARDS), utilization of mechanical ventilation, and adverse events (AEs).
32360583,Summary relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using random-effects models, and the quality of evidence was appraised using GRADEpro.
32360583,Eighteen articles (5 RCTs, 2 prospective cohort studies, and 11 retrospective cohort studies) involving 4,941 patients were included.
32360583,Compared with control treatment, anti-coronary virus interventions significantly reduced mortality (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.44-0.96; I<sup>2</sup> = 81.3%), remarkably ameliorate clinical improvement (RR 1.52, 95% CI 1.05-2.19) and radiographical improvement (RR 1.62, 95% CI 1.11-2.36, I<sup>2</sup> = 11.0 %), without manifesting clear effect on virological eradication, incidence of ARDS, intubation, and AEs.
32360583,Subgroup analyses demonstrated that the combination of ribavirin and corticosteroids remarkably decreased mortality (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.27-0.68).
32360583,The lopinavir/ritonavir-based combination showed superior virological eradication and radiographical improvement with reduced rate of ARDS.
32360583,Likewise, hydroxychloroquine improved radiographical result.
32360583,For safety, ribavirin could induce more bradycardia, anemia and transaminitis.
32360583,Meanwhile, hydroxychloroquine could increase AEs rate especially diarrhea.
32360583,Overall, the quality of evidence on most outcomes were very low.
32360583,In conclusion, although we could not draw a clear conclusion for the recommendation of potential therapies for COVID-19 considering the very low quality of evidence and wide heterogeneity of interventions and indications, our results may help clinicians to comprehensively understand the advantages and drawbacks of each anti-coronavirus agents on efficacy and safety profiles.
32360583,Lopinavir/ritonavir combinations might observe better virological eradication capability than other anti-coronavirus agents.
32360583,Conversely, ribavirin might cause more safety concerns especially bradycardia.
32360583,Thus, large RCTs objectively assessing the efficacy of antiviral therapies for SARS-CoV-2 infections should be conducted with high priority.
32360585,SARS-CoV-2 is a novel strain, causing a global pandemic since the end of 2019.
32360585,The majority of patients showed nonspecific symptoms such as fever, dry cough, and fatigue.
32360585,Most patients have a good prognosis while some with severe conditions could rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, coagulation dysfunction, and even die.
32360585,The exacerbation of the patient's condition may be due to a cytokine storm in the body.
32360585,Effective targeted therapies including antiviral and immunization are urgently needed.
32360585,Although many clinical trials are already underway and the majority of patients have received antiviral therapy based on medication experience with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and preliminary results from some clinical trials, there are no antiviral drugs proven to be effective currently.
32360585,We summarize the current therapeutic medicines used in the clinic, hope to be able to provide some implications for clinical medication.
32360608,In December 2019, an atypical pneumonia invaded the city of Wuhan, China, and the causative agent of this disease turned out to be a new coronavirus.
32360608,In January 2020, the World Health Organization named the new coronavirus 2019-nCoV and subsequently it is referred to as SARS-CoV2 and the related disease as CoViD-19 (Lai et al., 2020).
32360608,Very quickly, the epidemic led to a pandemic and it is now a worldwide emergency requiring the creation of new antiviral therapies and a related vaccine.
32360608,The purpose of this article is to review and investigate further the molecular mechanism by which the SARS-CoV2 virus infection proceeds via the formation of a hetero-trimer between its protein S, the ACE2 receptor and the B0AT1 protein, which is the &quot;entry receptor&quot; for the infection process involving membrane fusion (Li et al., 2003).
32360608,A reverse engineering process uses the formalism of the Hill function to represent the functions related to the dynamics of the biochemical interactions of the viral infection process.
32360608,Then, using a logical evaluation of viral density that measures the rate at which the cells are hijacked by the virus (and they provide a place for the virus to replicate) and considering the &quot;time delay&quot; given by the interaction between cell and virus, the expected duration of the incubation period is predicted.
32360608,The conclusion is that the density of the virus varies from the &quot;exposure time&quot; to the &quot;interaction time&quot; (virus-cells).
32360608,This model can be used both to evaluate the infectious condition and to analyze the incubation period.
32360608,The ongoing threat of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV2 pandemic is alarming and strategies for combating infection are highly desired.
32360608,This RNA virus belongs to the β-coronavirus genus and is similar in some features to SARS-CoV.
32360608,Currently, no vaccine or approved medical treatment is available.
32360608,The complex dynamics of the rapid spread of this virus can be demonstrated with the aid of a computational framework.
32360608,A mathematical model based on the principles of cell-virus interaction is developed in this manuscript.
32360608,The amino acid sequence of S proein and its interaction with the ACE-2 protein is mimicked with the aid of Hill function.
32360608,The mathematical model with delay is solved with the aid of numerical solvers and the parametric values are obtained with the help of MCMC algorithm.
32360608,A delay differential equation model is developed to demonstrate the dynamics of target cells, infected cells and the SARS-CoV2.
32360608,The important parameters and coefficients are demonstrated with the aid of numerical computations.
32360608,The resulting thresholds and forecasting may prove to be useful tools for future experimental studies and control strategies.
32360608,From the analysis, I is concluded that control strategy via delay is a promising technique and the role of Hill function formalism in control strategies can be better interpreted in an inexpensive manner with the aid of a theoretical framework.
32360679,The aim of our study was to determine the incidence, characteristics, and clinical outcomes of patients with the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection who had presented with and been treated for acute limb ischemia (ALI) during the 2020 coronavirus pandemic.
32360679,We performed a single-center, observational cohort study.
32360679,The data from all patients who had tested positive for COVID-19 and had presented with ALI requiring urgent operative treatment were collected in a prospectively maintained database.
32360679,For the present series, successful revascularization of the treated arterial segment was defined as the absence of early (&lt;30 days) re-occlusion or major amputation or death within 24 hours.
32360679,The primary outcomes were successful revascularization, early (≤30 days) and late (≥30 days) survival, postoperative (≤30 days) complications, and limb salvage.
32360679,We evaluated the data from 20 patients with ALI who were positive for COVID-19.
32360679,For the period from January to March, the incidence rate of patients presenting with ALI in 2020 was significantly greater than that for the same months in 2019 (23 of 141 [16.3%] vs 3 of 163 [1.8%]; P &lt; .001)].
32360679,Of the 20 included patients, 18 were men (90%) and two were women (10%).
32360679,Their mean age was 75 ± 9 years (range, 62-95 years).
32360679,All 20 patients already had a diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia.
32360679,Operative treatment was performed in 17 patients (85%).
32360679,Revascularization was successful in 12 of the 17 (70.6%).
32360679,Although successful revascularization was not significantly associated with the postoperative use of intravenous heparin (64.7% vs 83.3%; P = .622), no patient who had received intravenous heparin required reintervention.
32360679,Of the 20 patients, eight (40%) had died in the hospital.
32360679,The patients who had died were significantly older (81 ± 10 years vs 71 ± 5 years; P = .008).
32360679,The use of continuous postoperative systemic heparin infusion was significantly associated with survival (0% vs 57.1%; P = .042).
32360679,In our preliminary experience, the incidence of ALI has significantly increased during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Italian Lombardy region.
32360679,Successful revascularization was lower than expected, which we believed was due to a virus-related hypercoagulable state.
32360679,The use of prolonged systemic heparin might improve surgical treatment efficacy, limb salvage, and overall survival.
32360703,The current COVID-19 pandemic started several months ago and is still exponentially growing in most parts of the world - this is the most recent and alarming update.
32360703,COVID-19 requires the collaboration of nearly 200 countries to curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2 while gaining time to explore and improve treatment options especially for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and immunocompromised patients, who appear to be at high-risk to die from cardiopulmonary failure.
32360703,Currently unanswered questions are why elderly people, particularly those with pre-existing comorbidities seem to exhibit higher mortality rates after SARS-CoV-2 infection and whether intensive care becomes indispensable for these patients to prevent multi-organ failure and sudden death.
32360703,To face these challenges, we here summarize the molecular insights into viral infection mechanisms and implications for cardiovascular disease.
32360703,Since the infection starts in the upper respiratory system, first flu-like symptoms develop that spread throughout the body.
32360703,The wide range of affected organs is presumably based on the common expression of the major SARS-CoV-2 entry-receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
32360703,Physiologically, ACE2 degrades angiotensin II, the master regulator of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), thereby converting it into vasodilatory molecules, which have well-documented cardio-protective effects.
32360703,Thus, RAAS inhibitors, which may increase the expression levels of ACE2, are commonly used for the treatment of hypertension and CVD.
32360703,This, and the fact that SARS-CoV-2 hijacks ACE2 for cell-entry, have spurred controversial discussions on the role of ACE2 in COVID-19 patients.
32360703,In this review, we highlight the state-of-the-art knowledge on SARS-CoV-2-dependent mechanisms and the potential interaction with ACE2 expression and cell surface localization.
32360703,We aim to provide a list of potential treatment options and a better understanding of why CVD is a high risk factor for COVID-19 susceptibility and further discuss the acute as well as long-term cardiac consequences.
32360811,The first cases of COVID-19 infection were reported in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China.
32360811,Italy (in particular Lombardy) and France (in particular Northeast) have been gravely hit.
32360811,Both physicians and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients are deeply concerned that immunosuppressants or biologics may increase the risk of COVID-19 infection.
32360811,IOIBD has put in place an international registry, SECURE-IBD, for tracking all the cases with IBDs infected by COVID-19 (SECURE-IBD registry: http://www.covidibd.org).
32360811,It will describe the outcomes of infected patients and the association between IBD-related medications and these outcomes.
32361161,Since early December 2019, a number of pneumonia cases associated with unknown coronavirus infection were identified in Wuhan, China, and many additional cases were identified in other regions of China and in other countries within 3 months.
32361161,Currently, more than 80,000 cases have been diagnosed in China, including more than 3000 deaths.
32361161,The epidemic is spreading to the rest of the world, posing a grave challenge to prevention and control.
32361161,On February 12, 2020, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses and the World Health Organization officially named the novel coronavirus and associated pneumonia as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), respectively.
32361161,According to the recent research on SARS-CoV-2, the virus mainly infects the respiratory system but may cause damage to other systems.
32361161,In this paper, we will systematically review the pathogenic features, transmission routes, and infection mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2, as well as any adverse effects on the digestive system, urogenital system, central nervous system, and circulatory system, in order to provide a theoretical and clinical basis for the diagnosis, classification, treatment, and prognosis assessment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32361325,Vietnam was slowing the spread of COVID-19 to 200 cases by the end of March.
32361325,From perspective of a relatively vulnerable healthcare systems, timely interventions were implemented to different stage of pandemic progress to limit the spread.
32361325,The authors compiled literature on different public health measures in Vietnam in compared to the progression of COVID-19 from January to March 2020.
32361325,Three stages of pandemic progression of COVID-19 were recorded in Vietnam.
32361325,At 213 confirmed cases under treatment and isolation, a range of interventions were enforced including intensive and expansive contact, mass testing, isolation, and sterilization.
32361325,Many were in place before any case were reported.
32361325,Preparation were key for Vietnam's healthcare system in the ever-changing landscape of COVID-19 pandemic.
32361327,A few studies have revealed the clinical characteristics of hospitalized patients with COVID-19.
32361327,However, predictive factors for the outcomes remain unclear.
32361327,Attempted to determine the predictive factors for the poor outcomes of patients with COVID-19.
32361327,This is a single-center, retrospective study.
32361327,Clinical, laboratory, and treatment data were collected and analyzed from 111 hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Union Hospital.
32361327,The gathered data of discharged and deteriorated patients were compared.
32361327,Among these 111 patients, 93 patients were discharged and 18 patients were deteriorated.
32361327,The lymphocyte count (0.56 G/L [0.47-0.63] vs 1.30 G/L [0.95-1.65]) was lower in the deteriorated group than those in the discharged group.
32361327,The numbers of pulmonary lobe involved (5.00 [5.00-5.00] vs 4.00 [2.00-5.00]), serum C-reactive protein (CRP, 79.52 mg/L [61.25-102.98] vs 7.93 mg/L [3.14-22.50]), IL-6 (35.72 pg/mL [9.24-85.19] vs 5.09 pg/mL [3.16-9.72]), and IL-10 (5.35 pg/mL [4.48-7.84] vs 3.97 pg/mL [3.34-4.79]) concentrations in deteriorated patients were elevated compared with discharged patients.
32361327,Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that male gender (OR, 24.8 [1.8-342.1]), comorbidity (OR, 52.6 [3.6-776.4]), lymphopenia (OR, 17.3 [1.1-261.8]), and elevated CRP (OR, 96.5 [4.6-2017.6]) were the independent risk factors for the poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients.
32361327,This finding would facilitate the early identification of high-risk COVID-19 patients.
32361388,The spread of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global major public health event, threatening people's physical and mental health and even life safety.
32361388,This study is to investigate the psychological abnormality in health care workers battling the COVID-19 epidemic and to explore the associations among social support, resilience and mental health.
32361388,A total of 1521 health care workers, of whom 147 had public health emergency experience while 1374 showed no experience, completed the Symptom Check-List-90 (SCL-90), Chinese version of Connor-Davidson resilience scale (CD-RISC) and Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS). χ<sup>2</sup> test, t test and multiple regression analyses were used in statistical analysis.
32361388,The results showed that people without public health emergency treatment experience showed worse performance in mental health, resilience and social support, and tended to suffer from psychological abnormality on interpersonal sensitivity and photic anxiety.
32361388,This finding suggested that high levels of training and professional experience, resilience and social support were necessary to health care workers who are first taking part in public health emergence.
32361528,The world is facing a pandemic of unseen proportions caused by a corona virus named SARS-CoV-2 with unprecedent worldwide measures being taken to tackle its contagion.
32361528,Person-to-person transmission is accepted but WHO only considers aerosol transmission when procedures or support treatments that produce aerosol are performed.
32361528,Transmission mechanisms are not fully understood and there is evidence for an airborne route to be considered, as the virus remains viable in aerosols for at least 3 h and that mask usage was the best intervention to prevent infection.
32361528,Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning Systems (HVAC) are used as a primary infection disease control measure.
32361528,However, if not correctly used, they may contribute to the transmission/spreading of airborne diseases as proposed in the past for SARS.
32361528,The authors believe that airborne transmission is possible and that HVAC systems when not adequately used may contribute to the transmission of the virus, as suggested by descriptions from Japan, Germany, and the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship.
32361528,Previous SARS outbreaks reported at Amoy Gardens, Emergency Rooms and Hotels, also suggested an airborne transmission.
32361528,Further studies are warranted to confirm our hypotheses but the assumption of such way of transmission would cause a major shift in measures recommended to prevent infection such as the disseminated use of masks and structural changes to hospital and other facilities with HVAC systems.
32361701,in the reports presented about COVID-19, patients receiving kidney transplantation have not been specifically studied and based on national flowchart, this population is classified as highrisk group, thus it is necessary to be aware of the step-by-step treatment approach of these patients.
32361701,Suspicious cases included patients with a history of dry cough, chills or sore throat accompanying by shortness of breath with or without fever, patients with upper/lower respiratory symptoms with radiological manifestations as single or double-sided multilobular infiltrations on CT scan or plain chest radiography, any one that has a history of close contact with a definite COVID-19 case within the last 14 days, any one with a history of presence in COVID-19 epidemic regions within the last 14 days and patient with pneumonia that despite of proper treatment has an inappropriate clinical response and clinical condition becomes more severe in an unusual way or unexpectedly.
32361703,During the COVID-19 pandemic, we had a 25 years old male case without any underlying disease or history of autoimmune disease in COVID-19 Clinic, Isfahan, Iran.
32361703,He presented with arthralgia and weakness so we started COVID-19 therapeutic regimen.
32361703,In his hospitalization, creatinine increases and abnormalities in random urine sediment was seen.
32361703,Methylprednisolone and cyclophosphamide were prescribed due to suspected glomerulonephritis.
32361703,After renal biopsy the diagnose was confirmed as crescentic proliferative glomerulonephritis.
32361703,The patient also, underwent plasmapheresis and intravenous immunoglobulin injection.
32361703,He was discharged healthy without development of new pulmonary symptoms despite immunosuppressive treatment.
32361715,&quot;...but why think?
32361715,Why not try the experiment?...&quot; John Hunter (1728-1793), in a letter to Edward Jenner.
32361715,August 2<sup>nd</sup>, 1775.
32361715,When Galen of Pergamum (2<sup>nd</sup> c.
32361715,A.D.), physician, philosopher and experimentalist, sought to ascertain the therapeutic properties of Theriac, an antidote of repute against poisons, he resorted to an experiment.
32361715,Theriac or Theriaca was a compound drug, containing in some versions used in antiquity numerous components; Galen's own composition included over 70 ingredients!
32361715,One of its uses was as an antidote against snakebites, a frequent peril for the Roman armies marching on in sandals.
32361715,Galen spent most of his life in Rome and was elevated to Imperial Physician at the court of Marcus Aurelius, who apparently took daily doses of Theriac, which among other components included opium.
32361715,Describing the experiment to his friend Pison, Galen wrote, &quot;as I could not possibly conduct a trial on humans, I experimented on roosters&quot; For his experiment, Galen, studied two groups of roosters, but he doesn't tell us how many animals he included in each category.
32361715,Both groups were exposed to poisonous snakebites.
32361715,All roosters who were fed with theriac prior to exposure to viper bites survived, whereas in the second group that had not received prophylactic Theriac, all roosters died.
32361715,Not only is Galen's methodology remarkable, preceding the modern randomised trial by eighteen centuries, but more importantly, it is notable for his ethical stance at a time when sensitivities about human rights, prevalent in our times, were largely absent in societies of widespread slavery.
32361715,For example, Mithridates VI (132-63 BC), the King of Pontus who is credited with the first use of Theriac, tested its efficacy on criminals and slaves.
32361715,For his experiment Galen used the random allocation of treatment, today's prospective randomised clinical trial, implemented in the evaluation of novel therapies, widely used internationally, particularly in cancer research!
32361715,This experimental method used for ascertaining the efficacy of new drugs became established after the second half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century and is now firmly entrenched as a research tool.
32361715,On the other hand, the retrieval of information from observational studies or non-randomised series is considered scientifically inferior and is often dismissed or ignored as irrelevant or anecdotal.
32361715,Such is the compulsion for the randomised study that in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, respected physicians and scientists appeared in the media hesitant to recommend the use of protective facial masks, as there was no evidence of benefit for their use from prospective randomised studies in the general population!
32361715,Logic had no place in the argument!
32361715,COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 new corona virus, brought to the fore the randomised trial, as well as, the ethical dilemmas that surround the allocation of treatment at random, in the face of a devastating pandemic.
32361715,Anthony Fauci, distinguished infectious diseases expert and an adviser to the President of the USA, at a recent briefing from the Situation Room of the White House, endorsed categorically and unreservedly the randomised trial for the evaluation of drugs potentially effective against SARS-CoV-2, in patients afflicted with COVID-19.
32361715,A few days later on April 8<sup>th</sup>, 2020, Professor Sotiris Tsiodras, scientific advisor to the Greek Government for COVID-19 and an expert on infectious diseases, when asked by a journalist about chloroquine, he responded, &quot;Antony Fauci is correct.
32361715,Nevertheless, we give the drug to everyone, that is, not half of the patients will receive it, and the other half will not&quot;.
32361715,If we accept that the randomised trial represents the unique, impregnable method of evaluating new treatments-several clinicians dispute this dogma. -the question arises how will treatments be allocated to patients?
32361715,According to the Declaration of Helsinki participation of a subject in a clinical trial requires their explicit written consent.
32361715,Will, a potentially hypoxic patient rapidly deteriorating, be able to understand what is being asked of them, and will that patient be in a position to provide consent?
32361715,And if that patient refuses to be randomised, what are the options?
32361715,Is it his/her right to request the active treatment that a fellow patient is receiving in the next bed?
32361715,Although the Declaration of Helsinki allows the option of no treatment or even placebo, where no known treatment is available for a certain condition, such as COVID-19, it also emphasizes that &quot;while the primary purpose of medical research is to generate new knowledge, this goal can never take precedence over the rights and interests of individual research subjects&quot;.
32361715,Consider now the physicians and nurses on the first line of the battle against the pandemic; to the enormous pressures and risks that they experience daily, they may have to endure the added psychological burden of the randomised trial, knowing that half of their patients are receiving the promising drug, whilst the other half are denied the chance of potential benefit.
32361715,When during the Medical Research Council's randomized trial of streptomycin, one senior physician contracted tuberculosis, the Medical Research Council obtained supplies for him outside the trial.
32361715,In this brief instance of medical history, the equipoise, the scientific imperative, all arguments and other justifications for providing treatment at random, were thrown out of the window in favour of the human factor!
32361715,Why is randomization necessary?
32361715,Because-it is presumed-the process of randomising subjects, protects the study from the selective inclusion of patients with favourable characteristics, thus inadvertently allowing or facilitating a falsely favourable result for the drug or treatment under investigation.
32361715,However, the process of randomising patients does not necessarily result in the randomisation of the characteristics of their disease.
32361715,Exactly because of this, at the end of a randomised study, even if the prognostic variables are evenly represented and balanced in the strata, further confirmation of the result is sought with a statistical multifactorial analysis.
32361715,Such multifactorial analyses can also be applied to a non-randomised group of patients engaged in the trial of a new drug.
32361715,Since the middle of the 20<sup>th</sup> century a generation of physicians have been trained to dismiss, or are incapable of evaluating the validity of a treatment beyond the established etiquette of the randomised study.
32361715,This, some have argued, constitutes intellectual indolence, it is not scientific robustness.
32361715,Pandits foresee that the world will be different after the end of this pandemic.
32361715,Perhaps human ingenuity will seek new investigative methods that will render the randomised clinical trial obsolete, both, on methodological and ethical grounds.
32361715,Until then and even if we have to accept the scientific supremacy of the randomised study in the evaluation of novel therapies, the ethical considerations in the unprecedented circumstances of a relentless pandemic demand a more humane approach, befitting the beneficent precepts of the Hippocratic tradition.
32361738,With evidence of sustained transmission in more than 190 countries, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been declared a global pandemic.
32361738,Data are urgently needed about risk factors associated with clinical outcomes.
32361738,A retrospective review of 323 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan was conducted.
32361738,Patients were classified into three disease severity groups (non-severe, severe, and critical), based on initial clinical presentation.
32361738,Clinical outcomes were designated as favorable and unfavorable, based on disease progression and response to treatments.
32361738,Logistic regression models were performed to identify risk factors associated with clinical outcomes, and log-rank test was conducted for the association with clinical progression.
32361738,Current standard treatments did not show significant improvement in patient outcomes.
32361738,By univariate logistic regression analysis, 27 risk factors were significantly associated with clinical outcomes.
32361738,Multivariate regression indicated age over 65 years (p&lt;0.001), smoking (p=0.001), critical disease status (p=0.002), diabetes (p=0.025), high hypersensitive troponin I (&gt;0.04 pg/mL, p=0.02), leukocytosis (&gt;10 x 109/L, p&lt;0.001) and neutrophilia (&gt;75 x 109/L, p&lt;0.001) predicted unfavorable clinical outcomes.
32361738,By contrast, the administration of hypnotics was significantly associated with favorable outcomes (p&lt;0.001), which was confirmed by survival analysis.
32361738,Hypnotics may be an effective ancillary treatment for COVID-19.
32361738,We also found novel risk factors, such as higher hypersensitive troponin I, predicted poor clinical outcomes.
32361738,Overall, our study provides useful data to guide early clinical decision making to reduce mortality and improve clinical outcomes of COVID-19.
32361744,Remdesivir has received significant attention for its potential application in the treatment of COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2.
32361744,Remdesivir has already been tested for Ebola virus disease treatment and found to have activity against SARS and MERS coronaviruses.
32361744,The remdesivir core contains GS-441524, which interferes with RNA-dependent RNA polymerases alone.
32361744,In non-human primates, following IV administration, remdesivir is rapidly distributed into PBMCs and converted within 2 h to the active nucleoside triphosphate form, while GS-441524 is detectable in plasma for up to 24 h.
32361744,Nevertheless, remdesivir pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in humans are still unexplored, highlighting the need for a precise analytical method for remdesivir and GS-441524 quantification.
32361744,The validation of a reliable UHPLC-MS/MS method for remdesivir and GS-441524 quantification in human plasma.
32361744,Remdesivir and GS-441524 standards and quality controls were prepared in plasma from healthy donors.
32361744,Sample preparation consisted of protein precipitation, followed by dilution and injection into the QSight 220 UHPLC-MS/MS system.
32361744,Chromatographic separation was obtained through an Acquity HSS T3 1.8 μm, 2.1 × 50 mm column, with a gradient of water and acetonitrile with 0.05% formic acid.
32361744,The method was validated using EMA and FDA guidelines.
32361744,Analyte stability has been evaluated and described in detail.
32361744,The method successfully fulfilled the validation process and it was demonstrated that, when possible, sample thermal inactivation could be a good choice in order to improve biosafety.
32361744,This method represents a useful tool for studying remdesivir and GS-441524 clinical pharmacokinetics, particularly during the current COVID-19 outbreak.
32361747,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) arose at a time of great concern about antimicrobial resistance (AMR).
32361747,No studies have specifically assessed COVID-19-associated superinfections or AMR.
32361747,Based on limited data from case series, it is reasonable to anticipate that an appreciable minority of patients with severe COVID-19 will develop superinfections, most commonly pneumonia due to nosocomial bacteria and Aspergillus.
32361747,Microbiology and AMR patterns are likely to reflect institutional ecology.
32361747,Broad-spectrum antimicrobial use is likely to be widespread among hospitalized patients, both as directed and empiric therapy.
32361747,Stewardship will have a crucial role in limiting unnecessary antimicrobial use and AMR.
32361747,Congressional COVID-19 relief bills are considering antimicrobial reimbursement reforms and antimicrobial subscription models, but it is unclear if these will be included in final legislation.
32361747,Prospective studies on COVID-19 superinfections are needed, data from which can inform rational antimicrobial treatment and stewardship strategies, and models for market reform and sustainable drug development.
32361927,The aim of the present study was to evaluate the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on joint arthroplasty service in Europe by conducting an online survey of arthroplasty surgeons.
32361927,The survey was conducted in the European Hip Society (EHS) and the European Knee Associates (EKA).
32361927,The survey consisted of 20 questions (single, multiple choice, ranked).
32361927,Four topics were addressed: (1) origin and surgical experience of the participant (four questions); (2) potential disruption of arthroplasty surgeries (12 questions); (3) influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on the particular arthroplasty surgeon (four questions); (4) a matrix provided 14 different arthroplasty surgeries and the participant was asked to state whether dedicated surgery was stopped, delayed or cancelled.
32361927,Two-hundred and seventy-two surgeons (217 EHS, 55 EKA) from 40 different countries participated.
32361927,Of the respondents, 25.7% stated that all surgeries were cancelled in their departments, while 68.4% responded that elective inpatient procedures were no longer being performed.
32361927,With regard to the specific surgical procedures, nearly all primary TJA were cancelled (92.6%) as well as aseptic revisions (94.7%).
32361927,In most hospitals, periprosthetic fractures (87.2%), hip arthroplasty for femoral neck fractures and septic revisions for acute infections (75.8%) were still being performed.
32361927,During the current 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, we are experiencing a near-total shutdown of TJA.
32361927,A massive cutback was observed for primary TJA and revision TJA, even in massively failed TJA with collapse, dislocation, component failure or imminent dislocation.
32361927,Only life-threatening pathologies like periprosthetic fractures and acute septic TJA are currently undergoing surgical treatment.
32361927,V.
32362005,COVID-19 threatens millions of lives, especially elderly population and people with chronic diseases including diabetes, hypertension, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases.
32362005,Rapid and effective diagnoses are vital for the isolation of infected people and starting treatment immediately to stop the spread of COVID-19 virus.
32362005,Bioinformatics techniques such as artificial intelligence should be used for collecting the hemogram and serum biochemistry data of all COVID-19- infected people worldwide, even they do not show severe symptoms.
32362005,These data may help find a biomarker that can be used in combination with the CT results for rapid and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19.
32362061,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with high morbidity and mortality.
32362061,There are very limited data on the interference of immunomodulating drugs on the risk of infection and on the course of the disease.
32362061,In particular, there are no current clinical data about the interference exerted by dupilumab, a biologic drugs blocking IL-4 and IL-13, used for adult atopic dermatitis.
32362061,The pathogenesis of COVID-19 is complex, characterized by an immune response mainly Th1/Th17.
32362061,The hyper-activation of these cells may cause the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines that may result in lung impairment.
32362061,IL-4 and IL-13 are Th2 cytokines, thus being part of a pathway not considered implicated in host defense mechanism against viral infections.
32362061,Indeed, viral infections, including respiratory infections, have not been reported as a significant adverse event in clinical trials.
32362061,Furthermore, dupilumab has been proved to be efficacious also in exacerbations of asthma, and it is known that viral infections can worsen asthma.
32362061,Therefore, the current data seem to suggest that treatment with dupilumab should not be stopped during COVID-19 pandemic.
32362061,Obviously, a careful assessment is mandatory for each individual patient and further studies are necessary to characterize the immunologic responses in COVID-19.
32362134,This Project AesCert™ Guidance Supplement (&quot;Guidance Supplement&quot;) was developed in partnership with a multi-disciplinary panel of board-certified physician and doctoral experts in the fields of Infectious Disease, Immunology, Public Health Policy, Dermatology, Facial Plastic Surgery and Plastic Surgery.
32362134,The Guidance Supplement is intended to provide aesthetic medicine physicians and their staffs with a practical guide to safety considerations to support clinic preparedness for patients seeking non-surgical aesthetic treatments and procedures following the return-to-work phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, once such activity is permitted by applicable law.
32362134,Many federal, state and local governmental authorities, public health agencies and professional medical societies have promulgated COVID-19 orders and advisories applicable to health care practitioners.
32362134,The Guidance Supplement is intended to provide aesthetic physicians and their staffs with an additional set of practical considerations for delivering aesthetic care safely and generally conducting business responsibly in the new world of COVID-19.
32362134,Aesthetic providers will face new and unique challenges as government stay-at-home orders and related commercial limitations are eased, and the U.S. economy reopens and healthcare systems transition from providing only urgent and other essential treatment to resuming routine care and elective procedures and services.
32362134,The medical aesthetic specialties will therefore wish to resume practice in order to ensure high quality, expert care is available, and importantly to help promote patients' positive self-image and sense of well-being following a lengthy and stressful period of quarantine.
32362134,In a number of areas, this Guidance Supplement exceeds traditional aesthetic office safety precautions, recognizing reduced tolerance in an elective treatment environment for any risk associated with COVID-19's highly variable presentation and unpredictable course.
32362134,The disease has placed a disturbing number of young, otherwise healthy patients in extremis with severe respiratory and renal failure, stroke, pericarditis, neurologic deficits and other suddenly life-threatening complications, in addition to its pernicious effects on those with pre-existing morbidities and advanced age.
32362134,Accordingly, the Guidance Supplement seeks to establish an elevated safety profile for providing patient care while reducing, to the greatest extent reasonably possible, the risk of infectious processes to both patients and providers.
32362134,While the Guidance Supplement cannot foreclose the risk of infection, nor serve to establish or modify any standards of care, it does offer actionable risk-mitigation considerations for general office comportment and for certain non-surgical procedures typically performed in aesthetic medical settings.
32362134,It is axiomatic that all such considerations are necessarily subject to the ultimate judgment of each individual healthcare professional based on patient situation, procedure details, office environment, staffing constraints, equipment and testing availability, and local legal status and public health conditions.
32362193,<b>Introduction</b>: The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is currently in epidemic stage.
32362193,After large-scale interpersonal infection, asymptomatic patients appear.
32362193,Whether asymptomatic patients are contagious or not and whether they need medication are the arguments among clinical experts.<b>Areas covered</b>: This paper reports a special asymptomatic couple with COVID-19, of which the male patient is an intercity bus driver but has not induced confirmed infection of his 188 passengers.
32362193,The patients were treated with four combinations of lopinavir/ritonavir tablets, arbidol tablets, Lianhuaqingwen granules, and recombinant human interferon-α2b (IFN-α2b) injection via aerosol.
32362193,Their clinical characteristics and medication were summarized and analyzed.<b>Expert opinion</b>: The two asymptomatic patients far away from Wuhan did not seem to be highly contagious.
32362193,They improved obviously, after treatment with the quadruple therapy, but the effective drug is still unknown.
32362193,It should be noted that lopinavir/ritonavir tablets have many drug interactions and are the most likely drugs to cause hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia in these two patients.
32362193,IFN-α2b is more effective in the early stage of virus infection.
32362193,Arbidol instruction dose may not be sufficient to inhibit the novel coronavirus <i>in vivo</i>.
32362193,The evidence-based medicine of Lianhuaqingwen granules for treating various viral infections is just based on Chinese patients.
32362235,The current outbreak of a novel coronavirus, named as SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19 occurred in 2019, is in dire need of finding potential therapeutic agents.
32362235,Recently, ongoing viral epidemic due to coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) primarily affected mainland China that now threatened to spread to populations in most countries of the world.
32362235,In spite of this, there is currently no antiviral drug/ vaccine available against coronavirus infection, COVID-19.
32362235,In the present study, computer-aided drug design-based screening to find out promising inhibitors against the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) leads to infection, COVID-19.
32362235,The lead therapeutic molecule was investigated through docking and molecular dynamics simulations.
32362235,In this, binding affinity of noscapines(23B)-protease of SARS-CoV-2 complex was evaluated through MD simulations at different temperatures.
32362235,Our research group has established that noscapine is a chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of drug resistant cancers; however, noscapine was also being used as anti-malarial, anti-stroke and cough-suppressant.
32362235,This study suggests for the first time that noscapine exerts its antiviral effects by inhibiting viral protein synthesis.
32362245,A new strain of a novel infectious disease affecting millions of people, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has recently been declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO).
32362245,Currently, several clinical trials are underway to identify specific drugs for the treatment of this novel virus.
32362245,The inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease is necessary for the blockage of the viral replication.
32362245,Here, in this study, we have utilized a blind molecular docking approach to identify the possible inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, by screening a total of 33 molecules which includes natural products, anti-virals, anti-fungals, anti-nematodes and anti-protozoals.
32362245,All the studied molecules could bind to the active site of the SARS-CoV-2 protease (PDB: 6Y84), out of which rutin (a natural compound) has the highest inhibitor efficiency among the 33 molecules studied, followed by ritonavir (control drug), emetine (anti-protozoal), hesperidin (a natural compound), lopinavir (control drug) and indinavir (anti-viral drug).
32362245,All the molecules, studied out here could bind near the crucial catalytic residues, HIS41 and CYS145 of the main protease, and the molecules were surrounded by other active site residues like MET49, GLY143, HIS163, HIS164, GLU166, PRO168, and GLN189.
32362245,As this study is based on molecular docking, hence being particular about the results obtained, requires extensive wet-lab experimentation and clinical trials under <i>in vitro</i> as well as <i>in vivo</i> conditions.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

32362296,To prevent and control public health emergencies, we set up a prescreening and triage workflow and analyzed the effects on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32362296,In accordance with the requirements of the level 1 emergency response of public health emergencies in Shaanxi Province, China, a triage process for COVID-19 was established to guide patients through a 4-level triage process during their hospital visits.
32362296,The diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on positive COVID-19 nucleic acid testing according to the unified triage standards of the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (Trial version 4),4 issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
32362296,The screened rate of suspected COVID-19 was 1.63% (4 of 246) in the general fever outpatient clinic and 8.28% (13 of 157) in the COVID-19 outpatient clinic, and they showed a significant difference (P = .00).
32362296,The triage procedure effectively screened the patients and identified the high-risk population.
32362299,Treatment with psychotropic medication may sometimes be jeopardised because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
32362299,One underlying reason is the lack of COVID-19-specific psychopharmacology guidelines.
32362299,Here, we discuss five considerations arising from our clinical experience and pharmacological background knowledge to enable safe and well-informed psychopharmacotherapy during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32362344,The purpose of this study was to determine the risk factors associated with pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and clinical outcome among patients with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32362344,This was a cross-sectional multicenter clinical study.
32362344,A total of 95 patients infected with COVID-19 were enrolled.
32362344,The COVID-19 diagnostic standard was polymerase chain reaction detection of target genes of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
32362344,Clinical, laboratory, and radiologic results, as well as treatment outcome data, were obtained.
32362344,ARDS was defined as an oxygenation index (arterial partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen) ≤300 mm Hg.
32362344,Multivariate analysis showed that older age (odds ratio [OR], 1.078; p = 0.008) and high body mass index (OR, 1.327; p = 0.024) were independent risk factors associated with patients with pneumonia.
32362344,For patients with ARDS, multivariate analysis showed that only high systolic blood pressure (OR, 1.046; p = 0.025) and high lactate dehydrogenase level (OR, 1.010; p = 0.021) were independent risk factors associated with ARDS.
32362344,A total of 70 patients underwent CT imaging repeatedly after treatment.
32362344,Patients were divided in a disease exacerbation group (n = 19) and a disease relief group (n = 51).
32362344,High body mass index (OR, 1.285; p = 0.017) and tobacco smoking (OR, 16.13; p = 0.032) were independent risk factors associated with disease exacerbation after treatment.
32362344,These study results help in the risk stratification of patients with 2019-nCoV infection.
32362344,Patients with risk factors should be given timely intervention to avoid disease progression.
32362368,The massive inflow of patients with COVID-19 requiring urgent care has overloaded hospitals in France and impacts the management of other patients.
32362368,Deferring hospitalization and non-urgent surgeries has become a priority for surgeons today in order to relieve the health care system.
32362368,It is obviously not simple to reduce emergency surgery without altering the quality of care or leading to a loss of chance for the patient.
32362368,Acute appendicitis is a very specific situation and the prevalence of this disease leads us to reconsider this particular disease in the context of the COVID-19 crisis.
32362368,Indeed, while the currently recommended treatment for uncomplicated acute appendicitis is surgical appendectomy, the non-surgical alternative of medical management by antibiotic therapy alone has been widely evaluated by high-quality studies in the literature.
32362368,Insofar as the main limitation of exclusively medical treatment of uncomplicated acute appendicitis is the risk of recurrent appendicitis, this treatment option represents an alternative of choice to reduce the intra-hospital overload in this context of health crisis.
32362368,The aim of this work is therefore to provide physicians and surgeons with a practical guide based on a review of the literature on the medical treatment of uncomplicated acute appendicitis in adults, to offer this alternative treatment to the right patients and under good conditions, especially when access to the operating room is limited or impossible.
32362392,The epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of heart transplant (HTx) recipients during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic remains unclear.
32362392,We studied the characteristics of HTx recipients from December 20, 2019, to February 25, 2020, in an effort to understand their risk and outcomes.
32362392,All accessible HTx recipients were included in this single-center retrospective study.
32362392,We collected information on the recipients using a web-based questionnaire as well as the hospital database.
32362392,We followed 87 HTx recipients (72.4% were men, and the average age was 51 years).
32362392,A total of 79 recipients resided in Hubei, and 57 recipients had a Wuhan-related history of travel or contact.
32362392,Most took precautionary measures while in contact with suspicious crowds, and 96.6% of the families and communities undertook prevention and quarantine procedures.
32362392,Four upper airway infections were reported, and 3 of them tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 (the fourth recovered and was not tested).
32362392,All cases were mild and successfully recovered after proper treatment.
32362392,Laboratory results of 47 HTx cases within the last 2 months were extracted.
32362392,Of these, 21.3% of recipients had pre-existing lymphopenia, and 87.2% of recipients had a therapeutic concentration of tacrolimus (5-12 ng/ml).
32362392,Liver and kidney insufficiency was seen in 5 and 6 recipients, respectively.
32362392,HTx recipients who practiced appropriate prevention measures had a low rate of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and transition to the associated disease COVID-19.
32362392,These early data will require confirmation as the pandemic establishes around the world.
32362440,No specific and effective anti-viral treatment has been approved for COVID-19 so far.
32362440,Systemic corticosteroid has been sometimes administered to severe infectious diseases combined with the specific treatment.
32362440,However, as lack of the specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug, systemic steroid treatment has not been recommended for COVID-19.
32362440,We report here three cases of the COVID-19 pneumonia successfully treated with ciclesonide inhalation.
32362440,Rationale of the treatment is to mitigate the local inflammation with inhaled steroid that stays in the lung and to inhibit proliferation of the virus by antiviral activity.
32362440,Larger and further studies are warranted to confirm the result of these cases.
32362504,The analysis of real-life data from hospital information systems could make possible to decide on the efficacy and safety of Covid-19 treatments by avoiding the pitfalls of preliminary studies and randomized clinical trials.
32362504,The different drugs tested in current clinical trials are already widely prescribed to patients by doctors in hospitals, and can therefore be immediately analysed according to validated methodological standards.
32362583,The COVID-19 pandemic highlights the importance of Emergency Preparedness &amp; Response (EP&amp;R) education, training, capacity building and infrastructure development in India.
32362583,During the pandemic, pharmacy professionals (PPs) in India have continued to provide medications, supplies and services.
32362583,India's public-private healthcare system is complex and of variable quality.
32362583,Lacunae in pharmacy education, training, and lack of resolution around pharmacist roles present challenges in providing health services to patients.
32362583,Such lack of differentiation creates challenges around role specifications and appropriate placement of PPs in patient care and on EP&amp;R task forces or representation at the policy level.
32362583,This study aimed to gain rapid insights from PPs in India regarding their roles and preparedness for the COVID-19 pandemic.
32362583,An online survey comprising 20 questions regarding EP&amp;R and Operations management was developed using the Qualtrics® survey software and administered to a sample of PPs.
32362583,Survey results indicate that PPs were actively involved in essential pharmacy services despite minimal EP&amp;R training.
32362583,Based on lessons learned during COVID-19, lacunae in knowledge, training and regulations were identified and recommendations are provided to broaden PP roles and enable them to be better prepared and actively engaged in EP&amp;R for future emergencies.
32362644,As of February 29, 2020, more than 85,000 cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported from China and 53 other countries with 2,924 deaths.
32362644,On January 30, 2020, the first laboratory-confirmed case of COVID was reported from Kerala, India.
32362644,In view of the earlier evidence about effectiveness of repurposed lopinavir/ritonavir against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (CoV), as well as preliminary docking studies conducted by the ICMR-National Institute of Virology, Pune, the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization approved the restricted public health use of lopinavir/ritonavir combination amongst symptomatic COVID-19 patients detected in the country.
32362644,Hospitalized adult patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection with any one of the following criteria will be eligible to receive lopinavir/ritonavir for 14 days after obtaining written informed consent: (i) respiratory distress with respiratory rate ≥22/min or SpO<sub>2</sub>of &lt;94 per cent; (ii) lung parenchymal infiltrates on chest X-ray; (iii) hypotension defined as systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg or need for vasopressor/inotropic medication; (iv) new-onset organ dysfunction; and (v) high-risk groups - age &gt;60 yr, diabetes mellitus, renal failure, chronic lung disease and immunocompromised persons.
32362644,Patients will be monitored to document clinical (hospital length of stay and mortality at 14, 28 and 90 days), laboratory (presence of viral RNA in serial throat swab samples) and safety (adverse events and serious adverse events) outcomes.
32362644,Treatment outcomes amongst initial cases would be useful in providing guidance about the clinical management of patients with COVID-19.
32362644,If found useful in managing initial SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, further evaluation using a randomized control trial design is warranted to guide future therapeutic use of this combination.
32362735,At the end of December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, given the name of 2019-nCoV, emerged for exhibiting symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome.
32362735,The virus is spreading rapidly in China and around the globe, affecting thousands of people leading to a pandemic.
32362735,To control the mortality rate associated with the 2019-nCoV, prompt steps are needed.
32362735,Until now there is no effective treatment or drug present to control its life-threatening effects in the humans.
32362735,The scientist is struggling to find new inhibitors of this deadly virus.
32362735,In this study, to identify the effective inhibitor candidates against the main protease (Mpro) of 2019-nCoV, computational approaches were adopted.
32362735,Phytochemicals having immense medicinal properties as ligands were docked against the Mpro of 2019-nCoV to study their binding properties.
32362735,ADMET and DFT analyses were also further carried out to analyze the potential of these phytochemicals as an effective inhibitor against Mpro of 2019-nCoV.
32362969,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused infection in 168,000 cases worldwide in about 148 countries and killed more than 6,610 people around the world as of March 16, 2020, as per the World Health Organization (WHO).
32362969,Compared to severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome, there is the rapid transmission, long incubation period, and disease containment is becoming extremely difficult.
32362969,The main aim of this systematic review is to provide a comprehensive clinical summary of all the available data from high-quality research articles relevant to the epidemiology, demographics, trends in hospitalization and outcomes, clinical signs and symptoms, diagnostic methods and treatment methods of COVID-19, thus increasing awareness in health care providers.
32362969,We also discussed various preventive measures to combat COVID-19 effectively.
32362969,A systematic and protocol-driven approach is needed to contain this disease, which was declared as a global pandemic on March 11, 2020, by the WHO.
32363045,Since December 2019, increasing attention has been paid to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic in Wuhan, China.
32363045,SARS-CoV-2 primarily invades the respiratory tract and lungs, leading to pneumonia and other systemic disorders.
32363045,The effect of SARS-CoV-2 in transplant recipients has raised significant concerns, especially because there is a large population of transplant recipients in China.
32363045,Based on the current epidemic situation, this study reviewed publications on this virus and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), analyzed common features of respiratory viral pneumonias, and presented the currently reported clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in transplant recipients to improve strategies regarding the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 in this special population.
32363133,COVID-19 pandemic is plaguing the world and representing the most significant stress test for many national healthcare systems and services, since their foundation.
32363133,The supply-chain disruption and the unprecedented request for intensive care unit (ICU) beds have created in Europe conditions typical of low-resources settings.
32363133,This generated a remarkable race to find solutions for the prevention, treatment and management of this disease which is involving a large amount of people.
32363133,Every day, new Do-It-Yourself (DIY) solutions regarding personal protective equipment and medical devices populate social media feeds.
32363133,Many companies (e.g., automotive or textile) are converting their traditional production to manufacture the most needed equipment (e.g., respirators, face shields, ventilators etc.).
32363133,In this chaotic scenario, policy makers, international and national standards bodies, along with the World Health Organization (WHO) and scientific societies are making a joint effort to increase global awareness and knowledge about the importance of respecting the relevant requirements to guarantee appropriate quality and safety for patients and healthcare workers.
32363133,Nonetheless, ordinary procedures for testing and certification are currently questioned and empowered with fast-track pathways in order to speed-up the deployment of new solutions for COVID-19.
32363133,This paper shares critical reflections on the current regulatory framework for the certification of personal protective equipment.
32363133,We hope that these reflections may help readers in navigating the framework of regulations, norms and international standards relevant for key personal protective equipment, sharing a subset of tests that should be deemed essential even in a period of crisis.
32363136,The outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus continually led to worldwide human infections and deaths.
32363136,Currently, there is no specific viral protein-targeted therapeutics.
32363136,Viral nucleocapsid protein is a potential antiviral drug target, serving multiple critical functions during the viral life cycle.
32363136,However, the structural information of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein remains unclear.
32363136,Herein, we have determined the 2.7 Å crystal structure of the N-terminal RNA binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein.
32363136,Although the overall structure is similar as other reported coronavirus nucleocapsid protein N-terminal domain, the surface electrostatic potential characteristics between them are distinct.
32363136,Further comparison with mild virus type HCoV-OC43 equivalent domain demonstrates a unique potential RNA binding pocket alongside the <i>β</i>-sheet core.
32363136,Complemented by <i>in vitro</i> binding studies, our data provide several atomic resolution features of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein N-terminal domain, guiding the design of novel antiviral agents specific targeting to SARS-CoV-2.
32363157,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization.
32363157,The United States Food and Drug Administration has not approved any drug or vaccine for the treatment of COVID-19; however, reports have emerged from different parts of the world about the potential therapeutic benefits of existing drugs.
32363157,Chloroquine and phosphate hydroxychloroquine are the drugs currently in the limelight, and recently, the National Task Force for COVID-19 constituted by the Indian Council of Medical Research has recommended the use of antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 infection in selected high-risk individuals.
32363157,This short write-up explores the potential efficacy and established safety of chloroquine in COVID-19.
32363212,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a rapidly emerging viral infection causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32363212,Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have garnered unprecedented attention as potential therapeutic agents against COVID-19 following several small clinical trials, uncontrolled case series, and public figure endorsements.
32363212,While there is a growing body of scientific data, there is also concern for harm, particularly QTc prolongation and cardiac arrhythmias.
32363212,Here, we perform a rapid narrative review and discuss the strengths and limitations of existing <i>in vitro</i> and clinical studies.
32363212,We call for additional randomized controlled trial evidence prior to the widespread incorporation of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine into national and international treatment guidelines.
32363219,Recent outbreak of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 in December 2019 raised global health concerns.
32363219,Re-purposing the available protease inhibitor drugs for immediate use in treatment in SARS-CoV-2 infections could improve the currently available clinical management.
32363219,The current study, aims to predict theoretical structure for protease of COVID-19 and to explore further whether this protein can serve as a target for protease inhibitor drugs such as remdesivir, nelfinavir, lopinavir, ritonavir and α-ketoamide.
32363219,While the 3D structure of protease was predicted using SWISS MODEL server, molecular interaction studies between protein and ligands were performed using AutoDock software.
32363219,The predicted protease model was reasonably good based on reports generated by different validation servers.
32363219,The study further revealed that all the protease inhibitor drugs got docked with negative dock energy onto the target protein.
32363219,Molecular interaction studies showed that protease structure had multiple active site residues for remdesivir, while for remaining ligands the structure had only one active site residue each.
32363219,From the output of multiple sequence alignment, it is evident that ligand binding sites were conserved.
32363219,The current in silico study thus, provides structural insights about the protease of COVID-19 and also its molecular interactions with some of the known protease inhibitors.
32363221,Coronavirus infections have emerged as epidemic and pandemic threats in last two decades.
32363221,After the H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009, recently diagnosed novel betacoronavirus or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 has spread across 203 countries and territories in all 5 major continents.
32363221,World Health Organization (WHO) declared this as a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020.
32363221,Subsequently on February 11, 2020 a new name was given to this disease i.e.
32363221,COVID-19 by an expert group from WHO.
32363221,As of April 12, 2020, 10:00 CET, GMT+2:00, 1,696,588 confirmed cases and 105,952 confirmed deaths have been reported to the WHO.
32363221,(Coronavirus disease 2019, situation report 83).
32363221,It possibly originated from a small animal market in Wuhan, China.
32363221,A cluster of patients were admitted with unusual pneumonia not responding to treatment in various hospitals.
32363221,Epidemiological, genomic analysis and correlation with other coronaviruses led to the isolation of new coronavirus, closely resembling the bat coronaviruses, from such patients in Wuhan.
32363221,They were identified as the SARS-CoV-2.
32363221,This virus infection presents as influenza like illness in the affected people.
32363221,Fever, cough, respiratory distress with fatigue, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting are common symptoms seen in adults.
32363221,This may progress on to respiratory distress, hypoxia, need for oxygen supplementation and ventilator support as seen in patients in the SARS-CoV-1 epidemic (2003) in Guangdong, China.
32363221,The transmissibility of SARS-CoV-1 was less as compared to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and it was well controlled with good public health efforts.
32363221,The present COVID-19 epidemic is still in the acceleration phase of 3 and 4 in various countries.
32363221,Without any effective antiviral agents available at present, the need of the hour is early case detection, isolation of cases, use of good preventive care measures by the household contacts and in the hospital set up.
32363221,The results of ongoing clinical trials on hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin alone or in combination and a new antiviral agent remdesivir may help to treat some of the infections.
32363221,A need for effective vaccine is being seen an as good preventive strategy in this pandemic.
32363221,However the results of clinical trials and incorporation of vaccines in public health programs is a long way to go.
32363222,In December 2019, the corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China and rapidly spread worldwide.
32363222,Few information on clinical features and immunological profile of COVID-19 in paediatrics.
32363222,The clinical features and treatment outcomes of twelve paediatric patients confirmed as COVID-19 were analyzed.
32363222,The immunological features of children patients was investigated and compared with twenty adult patients.
32363222,The median age was 14.5-years (range from 0.64 to 17), and six of the patients were male.
32363222,The average incubation period was 8 days.
32363222,Clinically, cough (9/12, 75%) and fever (7/12, 58.3%) were the most common symptoms.
32363222,Four patients (33.3%) had diarrhea during the disease.
32363222,As to the immune profile, children had higher amount of total T cell, CD8+ T cell and B cell but lower CRP levels than adults (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05).
32363222,Ground-glass opacity (GGO) and local patchy shadowing were the typical radiological findings on chest CT scan.
32363222,All patients received antiviral and symptomatic treatment and the symptom relieved in 3-4 days after admitted to hospital.
32363222,The paediatric patients showed mild symptom but with longer incubation period.
32363222,Children infected with SARS-CoV-2 had different immune profile with higher T cell amount and low inflammatory factors level, which might ascribed to the mild clinical symptom.
32363222,We advise that nucleic acid test or examination of serum IgM/IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 should be taken for children with exposure history regardless of clinical symptom.
32363334,COVID-19 has been associated with cardiovascular complications including acute cardiac injury, heart failure and cardiogenic shock.
32363334,The role of veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) in the event of COVID-19-associated cardiovascular collapse has not yet been established.
32363334,We reviewed existing literature surrounding the role of VA-ECMO in the treatment of coronavirus-related cardiovascular collapse.
32363334,COVID-19 is associated with higher incidence of cardiovascular complications compared to previous coronavirus outbreaks (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV).
32363334,We found only one case report from China where COVID-19-associated fulminant myocarditis and cardiogenic shock (CS) was successfully rescued using VA-ECMO as a bridge to recovery (BTR).
32363334,We identified potential clinical scenarios (cardiac injury, myocardial infarction with and without obstructive coronary artery disease, viral myocarditis, and decompensated heart failure) leading to CS and risk factors for poor/uncertain benefit (age, sepsis, mixed/predominantly vasodilatory shock, prothrombotic state and/or coagulopathy, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure or high-risk prognostic scores) specific to using VA-ECMO as BTR in COVID-19 infection.
32363334,Additional considerations and proposed recommendations specific to the COVID-19 pandemic were formulated with guidance from published data and expert consensus.
32363334,A small subset of patients with cardiovascular complications from COVID-19 infection may progress to refractory CS.
32363334,Accepting that resource scarcity may be the overwhelming concern for healthcare systems during this pandemic, VA-ECMO can be considered in highly selected cases of refractory CS and echocardiographic evidence of biventricular failure.
32363334,The decision to initiate this therapy should take into consideration availability of resources, perceived benefit as well as risks of transmitting disease.
32363343,Graphical Abstract.
32363880,Therapeutic options for coronavirus disease 2019 are desperately needed to respond to the ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic.
32363880,Both antiviral drugs and immunomodulators might have their place in the management of coronavirus disease 2019.
32363880,Unfortunately, no drugs have been approved yet to treat infections with human coronaviruses.
32363880,As it will take years to develop new therapies for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the current focus is on the repurposing of drugs that have been approved or are in development for other conditions.
32363880,Several clinical trials have already been conducted or are currently ongoing to evaluate the efficacy of such drugs.
32363880,Here, we discuss the potential of these therapies for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019.
32363963,This is a report of a case with mucous membrane pemphigoid (MMP) with severe eye involvement and concurrent COVID-19 treated successfully using simultaneous high dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and anti-viral treatment as hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin.
32363963,He had finished a 2-g cycle of rituximab (RTX) in late January.
32363963,He was receiving mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) for one month and 30 mg prednisolone for three months until his hospitalization.
32363963,Prednisolone was tapered to 15 mg when current COVID-19 was suspected, considering his recent cough, dyspnea, and fever.
32364011,Emergent novel SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the current pandemic outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome with high mortality among the symptomatic population worldwide.
32364011,Given the absence of a current vaccine or specific antiviral treatment, it is urgent to search for FDA-approved drugs that can potentially inhibit essential viral enzymes.
32364011,The inhibition of 3CL<sup>pro</sup> has potential medical application, due to the fact that it is required for processing of the first translated replicase polyproteins into a series of native proteins, which are essential for viral replication in the host cell.
32364011,We employed an <i>in silico</i> approach to test if disulfiram, as well as its metabolites, and captopril could be used as potential antiviral drugs against COVID-19.
32364011,We provide data on the potential covalent interaction of disulfiram and its metabolites with the substrate binding subsite of 3CL<sup>pro</sup> and propose a possible mechanism for the irreversible protease inactivation thought the reaction of the aforementioned compounds with the Cys145.
32364011,Although, captopril is shown to be a potential ligand of 3CL<sup>pro</sup>, it is not recommended anti-COVID-19 therapy, due to the fact that it can induce the expression of the viral cellular receptor such as, angiotensin-converting enzyme ACE-2, and thus, making the patient potentially more susceptible to infection.
32364011,On the other hand, disulfiram, an alcoholism-averting drug, has been previously proposed as an antimicrobial and anti-SARS and MERS agent, safe to use even at higher doses with low side effects, it is recommended to be tested for control of SARS-CoV-2 infection.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

32364028,The rapid spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is affecting many countries.
32364028,While healthcare systems need to cope with the need to treat a large number of people with different degrees of respiratory failure, actions to preserve aliquots of the healthcare system to guarantee treatment to patients are mandatory.
32364028,In order to protect the Fondazione IRCCS-Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori di Milano from the spread of COVID-19, a number of to-hospital and within-hospital filters were applied.
32364028,Among others, a triage process to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positivity in patients with cancer was developed consisting of high-resolution low-dose computed tomography (CT) scan followed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nose-throat swabs whenever CT was suggestive of lung infection.
32364028,To serve symptomatic patients who were already admitted to the hospital or in need of hospitalization while waiting for RT-PCR laboratory confirmation of infection, a COVID-19 surveillance zone was set up.
32364028,A total of 301 patients were screened between March 6 and April 3, 2020.
32364028,Of these, 47 were hospitalized, 53 needed a differential diagnosis to continue with their cancer treatment, and 201 were about to undergo surgery.
32364028,RT-PCR was positive in 13 of 40 hospitalized patients (32%), 14 of 52 day hospital patients (27%), and 6 of 201 surgical patients (3%).
32364028,Applying filters to protect our comprehensive cancer center from COVID-19 spread contributed to guaranteeing cancer care during the COVID-19 crisis in Milan.
32364028,A surveillance area and surgical triage allowed us to protect the hospital from as many as 33 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.
32364041,SARS-CoV-2 is a new generation of coronavirus, which was first determined in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.
32364041,So far, however, there no effective treatment has been found to stop this new generation of coronavirus but discovering of the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (SARS-CoV-2 Mpro) may facilitate searching for new therapies for SARS-COV-2.
32364041,The aim was to assess the effectiveness of available FDA approved drugs which can construct a covalent bond with Cys145 inside binding site SARS-CoV-2 main protease by using covalent docking screening.
32364041,We conducted the covdock module MMGBSA module in the Schrodinger suite 2020-1, to examine the covalent bonding utilizing.
32364041,Besides, we submitted the top three drugs to molecular dynamics simulations via Gromacs 2018.1.
32364041,The covalent docking showed that saquinavir, ritonavir, remdesivir, delavirdine, cefuroxime axetil, oseltamivir and prevacid have the highest binding energies MMGBSA of -72.17, -72.02, -65.19, -57.65, -54.25, -51.8, and -51.14 kcal/mol, respectively.
32364041,The 50 ns molecular dynamics simulation was conducted for saquinavir, ritonavir and remdesivir to evaluate the stability of these drugs inside the binding pocket of SARS-CoV-2 main protease.
32364041,The current study provides a powerful in silico results, means for rapid screening of drugs as anti-protease medications and recommend that the above-mentioned drugs can be used in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 in combined or sole therapy.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

32364048,The paper considers the recently published British Medical Association Guidance on ethical issues arising in relation to rationing of treatment during the COVID-19 Pandemic.
32364048,It considers whether it is lawful to create policies for the rationing and withdrawal of treatment, and goes on to consider how such policies might apply in practice.
32364048,Legal analysis is undertaken of certain aspects of the Guidance which appear to misunderstand the law in respect of withdrawing treatment.
32364119,SARS-CoV-2 was first detected in December 2019 in the Chinese city of Wuhan and has since spread across the world.
32364119,At present, the virus has infected over 1.7 million people and caused over 100 000 deaths worldwide.
32364119,Research is currently focused on understanding the acute infection and developing effective treatment strategies.
32364119,In view of the magnitude of the epidemic, we conducted a speculative review of possible medium- and long-term neurological consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with particular emphasis on neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases of neuroinflammatory origin, based on the available evidence on neurological symptoms of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32364119,We systematically reviewed the available evidence about the pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the immediate and lasting effects of the cytokine storm on the central nervous system, and the consequences of neuroinflammation for the central nervous system.
32364119,SARS-CoV-2 is a neuroinvasive virus capable of triggering a cytokine storm, with persistent effects in specific populations.
32364119,Although our hypothesis is highly speculative, the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the onset and progression of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases of neuroinflammatory origin should be regarded as the potential cause of a delayed pandemic that may have a major public health impact in the medium to long term.
32364119,Cognitive and neuropsychological function should be closely monitored in COVID-19 survivors.
32364527,Currently, we are on a global pandemic of Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) which causes fever, dry cough, fatigue and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that may ultimately lead to the death of the infected.
32364527,Current researches on COVID-19 continue to highlight the necessity for further understanding the virus-host synergies.
32364527,In this study, we have highlighted the key cytokines induced by coronavirus infections.
32364527,We have demonstrated that genes coding interleukins (Il-1α, Il-1β, Il-6, Il-10), chemokine (Ccl2, Ccl3, Ccl5, Ccl10), and interferon (Ifn-α2, Ifn-β1, Ifn2) upsurge significantly which in line with the elevated infiltration of T cells, NK cells and monocytes in SARS-Cov treated group at 24 hours.
32364527,Also, interleukins (IL-6, IL-23α, IL-10, IL-7, IL-1α, IL-1β) and interferon (IFN-α2, IFN2, IFN-γ) have increased dramatically in MERS-Cov at 24 hours.
32364527,A similar cytokine profile showed the cytokine storm served a critical role in the infection process.
32364527,Subsequent investigation of 463 patients with COVID-19 disease revealed the decreased amount of total lymphocytes, CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T lymphocytes in the severe type patients which indicated COVID-19 can impose hard blows on human lymphocyte resulting in lethal pneumonia.
32364527,Thus, taking control of changes in immune factors could be critical in the treatment of COVID-19.
32364677,In late December 2019, China reported cases of respiratory illness in humans that involved a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
32364677,On March 20, 2020, the first coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Brazil was diagnosed, and by now, we present the report on the first case of COVID among transplant recipients in our country.
32364677,A liver and kidney transplant patient with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia without respiratory failure was treated in a clinical multimodal strategy consisting of symptomatic support therapy, immunosuppression reduction, use of anti-coronavirus drugs and heparin leading to a progressive improvement of patient symptoms till discharge.
32364677,The authors also present a comprehensive review of published cases.
32365215,Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are currently being evaluated as treatment against COVID-19.
32365215,These drugs are associated with some potential harms, including QTc-interval prolongation, hypoglycaemia, severe skin reactions and psychiatric effects.
32365215,Use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine should be reserved to current indications or clinical trials, as recommended by several governmental medical products agencies.
32365415,To improve resource allocation in face of the COVID-19 pandemic, hospitals around the country are restricting the performance of elective surgery to preserve ventilators, operating rooms, ICU beds and protect anesthesiologists.
32365415,For patients with severe aortic stenosis, efforts to bring treatment to symptomatic patients amid this pandemic might lead to favored use of catheter based management using minimalist techniques that do not require these elements.
32365415,In this context, some patients with well tested surgical indications for valve replacement may be treated by catheter-based methods.
32365415,It is important that outcomes for these cases are followed closely both at respective sites and in national registries.
32365415,As we recover from this pandemic, surgical cases should once again be driven by multi-disciplinary discussion and clinical trial data, and not a mentality of crisis management.
32365466,The emerging coronavirus disease (COVID-19) swept across the world, affecting more than 200 countries and territories.
32365466,Genomic analysis suggests that the COVID-19 virus originated in bats and transmitted to humans through unknown intermediate hosts in the Wuhan seafood market, China, in December of 2019.
32365466,This virus belongs to the <i>Betacoronavirus</i> group, the same group of the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and for the similarity, it was named SARS-CoV-2.
32365466,Given the lack of registered clinical therapies or vaccines, many physicians and scientists are investigating previously used clinical drugs for COVID-19 treatment.
32365466,In this review, we aim to provide an overview of the CoVs origin, pathogenicity, and genomic structure, with a focus on SARS-CoV-2.
32365466,Besides, we summarize the recently investigated drugs that constitute an option for COVID-19 treatment.
32365556,The cytokine storm is an abnormal production of inflammatory cytokines, due to the over-activation of the innate immune response.
32365556,This mechanism has been recognized as a critical mediator of influenza-induced lung disease, and it could be pivotal for COVID-19 infections.
32365556,Thus, an immunomodulatory approach targeting the over-production of cytokines could be proposed for viral aggressive pulmonary disease treatment.
32365556,In this regard, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ, a member of the PPAR transcription factor family, could represent a potential target.
32365556,Beside the well-known regulatory role on lipid and glucose metabolism, PPAR-γ also represses the inflammatory process.
32365556,Similarly, the PPAR-γ agonist thiazolidinediones (TZDs), like pioglitazone, are anti-inflammatory drugs with ameliorating effects on severe viral pneumonia.
32365556,In addition to the pharmacological agonists, also nutritional ligands of PPAR-γ, like curcuma, lemongrass, and pomegranate, possess anti-inflammatory properties through PPAR-γ activation.
32365556,Here, we review the main synthetic and nutritional PPAR-γ ligands, proposing a dual approach based on the strengthening of the immune system using pharmacological and dietary strategies as an attempt to prevent/treat cytokine storm in the case of coronavirus infection.
32365891,Recently, due to the coronavirus pandemic, many guidelines and anti-contagion strategies continue to report unclear information about the persistence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the environment.
32365891,This certainly generates insecurity and fear in people, with an important psychological component that is not to be underestimated at this stage of the pandemic.
32365891,The purpose of this article is to highlight all the sources currently present in the literature concerning the persistence of the different coronaviruses in the environment as well as in medical and dental settings.
32365891,As this was a current study, there are still not many sources in the literature, and scientific strategies are moving towards therapy and diagnosis, rather than knowing the characteristics of the virus.
32365891,Such an article could be an aid to summarize virus features and formulate new guidelines and anti-spread strategies.
32366025,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which first occurred in Wuhan (China) in December of 2019, causes a severe acute respiratory illness with a high mortality rate, and has spread around the world.
32366025,To gain an understanding of the evolution of the newly emerging SARS-CoV-2, we herein analyzed the codon usage pattern of SARS-CoV-2.
32366025,For this purpose, we compared the codon usage of SARS-CoV-2 with that of other viruses belonging to the subfamily of <i>Orthocoronavirinae</i>.
32366025,We found that SARS-CoV-2 has a high AU content that strongly influences its codon usage, which appears to be better adapted to the human host.
32366025,We also studied the evolutionary pressures that influence the codon usage of five conserved coronavirus genes encoding the viral replicase, spike, envelope, membrane and nucleocapsid proteins.
32366025,We found different patterns of both mutational bias and natural selection that affect the codon usage of these genes.
32366025,Moreover, we show here that the two integral membrane proteins (matrix and envelope) tend to evolve slowly by accumulating nucleotide mutations on their corresponding genes.
32366025,Conversely, genes encoding nucleocapsid (N), viral replicase and spike proteins (S), although they are regarded as are important targets for the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs, tend to evolve faster in comparison to the two genes mentioned above.
32366025,Overall, our results suggest that the higher divergence observed for the latter three genes could represent a significant barrier in the development of antiviral therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2.
32366034,COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization, with a high fatality rate that may reach 8%.
32366034,The disease is caused by SARS-CoV-2 which is one of the coronaviruses.
32366034,Realizing the severity of outcomes associated with this disease and its high rate of transmission, dentists were instructed by regulatory authorities, such as the American Dental Association, to stop providing treatment to dental patients except those who have emergency complaints.
32366034,This was mainly for protection of dental healthcare personnel, their families, contacts, and their patients from the transmission of virus, and also to preserve the much-needed supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE).
32366034,Dentists at all times should competently follow cross-infection control protocols, but particularly during this critical time, they should do their best to decide on the emergency cases that are indicated for dental treatment.
32366034,Dentists should also be updated on how this pandemic is related to their profession in order to be well oriented and prepared.
32366034,This overview will address several issues concerned with the COVID-19 pandemic that directly relate to dental practice in terms of prevention, treatment, and orofacial clinical manifestations.
32366173,Epistaxis is a common complaint in the general population, and its treatment is a common procedure in emergency departments.
32366173,In the COVID-19 era, procedures involving airway management are a particular risk for health care workers due to the high virulence of the virus, the transmission through aerosol, and the risk of contagion from asymptomatic patients.
32366173,In this article, we propose a simple memorandum of clinical recommendations to minimize the risk of operator infection deriving from epistaxis management.
32366173,The correct use of personal protective equipment and strict compliance with the behavioral guidelines are essential to reduce the potential risk of infection.
32366173,In particular, the use of filtering masks is strongly recommended since all patients, including those referring for epistaxis, should be treated as being COVID-19 positive in the emergency department.
32366173,The safety of health care workers is essential not only to safeguard continuous patient care but also to limit virus transmission.
32366178,COVID-19 is a rapidly growing global pandemic caused by a novel coronavirus.
32366178,With no vaccine or definitive treatment, public health authorities have recommended a strategy of &quot;social distancing,&quot; reducing individual interaction, canceling elective procedures, and limiting nonessential services.
32366178,Health care providers must determine what procedures are considered &quot;elective,&quot; balancing risk of treatment delays with that of coronavirus exposure to patient, family, and providers.
32366178,Given critical periods for language development and the long-term impact of auditory deprivation, some audiologic and otologic services should be considered essential.
32366178,In this article, we describe the experience of a quaternary referral pediatric hospital in Seattle, the epicenter of COVID-19 in the United States, and share strategies for risk minimization employed by Seattle Children's Hospital.
32366178,We hope that this work can be a reference for other centers continuing care for children who are deaf and hard of hearing during the COVID-19 and future resource-limiting crises.
32366290,The outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) worldwide is becoming rapidly a major concern.
32366290,The number of severe cases has increased dramatically worldwide, while specific treatment options are scarce.
32366290,The main pathologic features of severe or critical COVID-19 were consistent with acute lung injure (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), characterized by cellular fibromyxoid exudates, extensive pulmonary inflammation, pulmonary edema, and hyaline membrane formation.
32366290,Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can balance the inflammatory response and has been mentioned to be effective on ALI/ARDS from both infectious and noninfectious causes previously, presenting an important opportunity to be applied to COVID-19.
32366290,In this commentary, we summarize the clinical trials of MSCs treatments on ALI/ARDS and raise MSCs as a hopefully alternative therapy for severe or critical COVID-19.
32366658,The COVID-19 outbreak is a global pandemic with community circulation in many countries, including the United States, with confirmed cases in all states.
32366658,The course of this pandemic will be shaped by how governments enact timely policies and disseminate information and by how the public reacts to policies and information.
32366658,Here, we examine information-seeking responses to the first COVID-19 case public announcement in a state.
32366658,Using an event study framework for all US states, we show that such news increases collective attention to the crisis right away.
32366658,However, the elevated level of attention is short-lived, even though the initial announcements are followed by increasingly strong policy measures.
32366658,Specifically, searches for &quot;coronavirus&quot; increased by about 36% (95% CI: 27 to 44%) on the day immediately after the first case announcement but decreased back to the baseline level in less than a week or two.
32366658,We find that people respond to the first report of COVID-19 in their state by immediately seeking information about COVID-19, as measured by searches for coronavirus, coronavirus symptoms, and hand sanitizer.
32366658,On the other hand, searches for information regarding community-level policies (e.g., quarantine, school closures, testing) or personal health strategies (e.g., masks, grocery delivery, over-the-counter medications) do not appear to be immediately triggered by first reports.
32366658,These results are representative of the study period being relatively early in the epidemic, and more-elaborate policy responses were not yet part of the public discourse.
32366658,Further analysis should track evolving patterns of responses to subsequent flows of public information.
32366740,Ibuprofen is an over-the-counter medication that is used widely for the treatment of pain and fever during COVID-19 pandemic.
32366740,A concern was raised regarding the safety of ibuprofen use because of its role in increasing ACE2 levels within the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone system.
32366740,ACE2 is the coreceptor for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into cells, and so, a potential increased risk of contracting COVID-19 disease and/or worsening of COVID-19 infection was feared with ibuprofen use.
32366740,However, available data from limited studies show administration of recombinant ACE2 improves lung damage caused by respiratory viruses, suggesting ibuprofen use may be beneficial in COVID-19 disease.
32366740,At this time, there is no supporting evidence to discourage the use of ibuprofen.
32366746,In December 2019, a novel coronavirus was identified in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China and later the disease was named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32366746,On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially announced that COVID-19 had reached global pandemic status.
32366746,This article summarized the understanding of the etiology, pathogenesis, epidemiology, clinical characteristics, diagnosis, treatment, rehabilitation, and prevention and control measures of COVID-19 based on the available data and anti-epidemic experience in China.
32366817,The emergence of the novel human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan, China has caused a worldwide epidemic of respiratory disease (COVID-19).
32366817,Vaccines and targeted therapeutics for treatment of this disease are currently lacking.
32366817,Here we report a human monoclonal antibody that neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 (and SARS-CoV) in cell culture.
32366817,This cross-neutralizing antibody targets a communal epitope on these viruses and may offer potential for prevention and treatment of COVID-19.
32367170,Little evidence of increased thrombotic risk is available in COVID-19 patients.
32367170,Our purpose was to assess thrombotic risk in severe forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32367170,All patients referred to 4 intensive care units (ICUs) from two centers of a French tertiary hospital for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to COVID-19 between March 3rd and 31st 2020 were included.
32367170,Medical history, symptoms, biological data and imaging were prospectively collected.
32367170,Propensity score matching was performed to analyze the occurrence of thromboembolic events between non-COVID-19 ARDS and COVID-19 ARDS patients.
32367170,150 COVID-19 patients were included (122 men, median age 63 [53; 71] years, SAPSII 49 [37; 64] points).
32367170,Sixty-four clinically relevant thrombotic complications were diagnosed in 150 patients, mainly pulmonary embolisms (16.7%). 28/29 patients (96.6%) receiving continuous renal replacement therapy experienced circuit clotting.
32367170,Three thrombotic occlusions (in 2 patients) of centrifugal pump occurred in 12 patients (8%) supported by ECMO.
32367170,Most patients (&gt; 95%) had elevated D-dimer and fibrinogen.
32367170,No patient developed disseminated intravascular coagulation.
32367170,Von Willebrand (vWF) activity, vWF antigen and FVIII were considerably increased, and 50/57 tested patients (87.7%) had positive lupus anticoagulant.
32367170,Comparison with non-COVID-19 ARDS patients (n = 145) confirmed that COVID-19 ARDS patients (n = 77) developed significantly more thrombotic complications, mainly pulmonary embolisms (11.7 vs.
32367170,2.1%, p &lt; 0.008).
32367170,Coagulation parameters significantly differed between the two groups.
32367170,Despite anticoagulation, a high number of patients with ARDS secondary to COVID-19 developed life-threatening thrombotic complications.
32367170,Higher anticoagulation targets than in usual critically ill patients should therefore probably be suggested.
32367205,SARS-CoV-2 can attack the central nervous system in the early stages of infection.
32367205,Headache, anosmia, and dysgeusia are common symptoms.
32367205,Disturbance of consciousness and seizures can occur as complications in case of severe COVID-19.
32367205,We described the case of a COVID-19 patient admitted for interstitial pneumonia and seizures.
32367205,MRI showed newly diagnosed demyelinating lesions.
32367205,High-dose steroid treatment allowed neurological and respiratory recovery.
32367205,We speculated a delayed immune response induced by SARS-CoV-2.
32367205,The virus may lead to a SIRS-like immune disorder or play a role of infective trigger.
32367205,Prompt invasive treatment should be adopted to avoid hypoxic neurotoxicity and prevent CNS injuries.
32367431,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has caused a global pandemic in only 3 months.
32367431,In addition to major respiratory distress, characteristic neurological manifestations are also described, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 may be an underestimated opportunistic pathogen of the brain.
32367431,Based on previous studies of neuroinvasive human respiratory coronaviruses, it is proposed that after physical contact with the nasal mucosa, laryngopharynx, trachea, lower respiratory tract, alveoli epithelium, or gastrointestinal mucosa, SARS-CoV-2 can induce intrinsic and innate immune responses in the host involving increased cytokine release, tissue damage, and high neurosusceptibility to COVID-19, especially in the hypoxic conditions caused by lung injury.
32367431,In some immune-compromised individuals, the virus may invade the brain through multiple routes, such as the vasculature and peripheral nerves.
32367431,Therefore, in addition to drug treatments, such as pharmaceuticals and traditional Chinese medicine, non-pharmaceutical precautions, including facemasks and hand hygiene, are critically important.
32367683,To determine whether COVID-19 may adversely affect outcome of myocardial infarction (MI) patients in Hong Kong, China.
32367683,The COVID-19 pandemic has infected thousands of people and placed enormous stress on healthcare system.
32367683,Apart from being an infectious disease, it may affect human behavior and healthcare resource allocation which potentially cause treatment delay in MI.
32367683,This was a single center cross-sectional observational study.
32367683,From November 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020, we compared outcome of patients admitted for acute ST-elevation MI (STEMI) and non-ST elevation MI (NSTEMI) before (group 1) and after (group 2) January 25, 2020 which was the date when Hong Kong hospitals launched emergency response measures to combat COVID-19.
32367683,There was a reduction in daily emergency room attendance since January 25, 2020 (group 1,327/day vs. group 2,231/day) and 149 patients with diagnosis of MI were included into analysis (group 1 N = 85 vs. group 2 N = 64).
32367683,For STEMI, patients in group 2 tended to have longer symptom-to-first medical contact time and more presented out of revascularization window (group 1 27.8 vs. group 2 33%).
32367683,The primary composite outcome of in-hospital death, cardiogenic shock, sustained ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation (VT/VF) and use of mechanical circulatory support (MCS) was significantly worse in group 2 (14.1 vs.
32367683,29.7%, p = .02).
32367683,More MI patients during COVID-19 outbreak had complicated in-hospital course and worse outcomes.
32367683,Besides direct infectious complications, cardiology community has to acknowledge the indirect effect of communicable disease on our patients and system of care.
32367746,Potential but unconfirmed risk factors for coronavirus disease 2019 in adults and children may include hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease, as well as the medications commonly prescribed for these conditions, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers.
32367746,Coronavirus binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, a crucial component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, underlies much of this concern.
32367746,Children are uniquely impacted by the coronavirus but the reasons are unclear.
32367746,This review will highlight the relationship of coronavirus disease 2019 with hypertension, use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers, and lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease from the pediatric perspective.
32367746,We briefly summarize the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and comprehensively review the literature pertaining to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2/angiotensin-(1-7) pathway in children and the clinical evidence for how angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers affect this important pathway.
32367746,Given the importance of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2/angiotensin-(1-7) pathway and the potential differences between adults and children, it is crucial that children are included in coronavirus-related research, as this may shed light on potential mechanisms for why children are at decreased risk of severe coronavirus disease 2019.
32367812,A gentleman in his early fifties became ill with flu-like symptoms after vacationing abroad and was diagnosed with COVID-19 after returning to Iceland.
32367812,A few days later he was admitted to the University Hospital, Landspitali, due to worsening respiratory symptoms and severe fatigue.
32367812,A computed tomography scan of lthe lungs showed diffuse bilateral consolidations and ground glass changes.
32367812,He developed respiratory failure and was transferred to the intensive care unit where he received further treatment, including tocilizumab (IL-6 receptor inhibitor).
32367812,He subsequently showed clinical improvement and did not require endotracheal intubation.
32367847,Rapid transmission of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has led to the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
32367847,The current emphasis is on preventive strategies such as social distancing, face mask, and hand washing.
32367847,The technique of nasopharyngeal wash to prevent the virus from inhabiting and replicating in the nasal and pharyngeal mucosa has been suggested to be useful in reducing symptoms, transmission, and viral shedding in cases of viral acute respiratory tract infections.
32367847,In rapid systematic review, we found studies showing some improvement in prevention and treatment of upper respiratory tract infections.
32367847,We postulate that hypertonic saline gargles and nasal wash may be useful in prevention and for care of patients with COVID-19.
32367847,The present evidence emphasizes the need of randomized controlled trials to evaluate the role and mechanism of nasopharyngeal wash in COVID-19.
32367852,COVID-19 has emerged as one of the most significant illnesses of the current century.
32367852,It is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.
32367852,The world was initially viewing it as a localized outbreak in Wuhan city of China; however, it started spreading quickly to other parts of the world.
32367852,Globally, half-hearted containment measures and a false sense of safety against this novel coronavirus led to the dissemination of disease.
32367852,Currently, no effective therapy or vaccine is available to manage this illness.
32367852,After learning a huge lesson, global efforts would hopefully lead to effective control of this pandemic.
32367888,BACKGROUND Chest CT has an essential role in the detection and evaluation of novel coronary pneumonia (COVID-19) and has be regarded as a critical supplement for RT-PCR.
32367888,This study explored the dynamic CT manifestations of COVID-19 at different times and the value of some laboratory indicators for clinical guidance.
32367888,MATERIAL AND METHODS This retrospective review included 44 patients who were infected with COVID-19.
32367888,The dynamic chest CT and laboratory findings were obtained from electronic medical records.
32367888,The intervals between onset and CT scans and the dynamic changes of the lesions were recorded.
32367888,The above data were reviewed, sorted, and analyzed by using SPSS 21.0 software.
32367888,RESULTS From the time of onset, the dynamic image of the lungs became more complete.
32367888,Fibrous cord shadow absorption in the lungs were observed.
32367888,Experimental indicators, biochemical indicators of lymphocytes, and protein series were decreased to varying degrees, while erythrocyte sedimentation, fibrinogen, and D-dimer were increased to varying degrees.
32367888,CONCLUSIONS The dynamic changes of CT images of lungs of COVID-19 patients, combined with the clinical manifestations and laboratory indicators of patients, can help guide clinical diagnosis and treatment.
32368252,The epidemiological emergency caused by CoV-2 (COVID-19) has changed priorities in breast cancer management.
32368252,In those places where the pandemic has had the greatest effect, it is of paramount importance for most patients to be at home, reducing or postponing their attendance at clinics, as well as avoiding surgeries.
32368252,In this scenario, neoadjuvant endocrine treatment could be an appropriate alternative treatment for hormone receptor positive breast cancer (luminal-like tumours) in order to minimise hospital admissions and to delay elective surgeries.
32368252,Accordingly, we present a simple protocol that can be applied to most cases of luminal-like breast cancer and is appropriate for the majority of secondary or tertiary medical centres, or even primary care.
32368429,The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly spread across the world and now affects more people within the United States than any other country.
32368429,New York City has emerged as the epicenter of the outbreak in the United States.
32368429,Both locally and across the country, there is great concern in our ability to deliver appropriate medical care during this time.
32368429,Radiation therapy is another essential clinical service that cannot afford to suffer prolonged delays without compromising patient outcomes.
32368429,Early action and guidance are therefore critical to minimize transmission events and ensure safe and timely delivery of radiation therapy.
32368429,The New York Proton Center (NYPC) is a high-volume free-standing multi-institutional proton center located in Manhattan.
32368429,The purpose of this report is to describe the institutional patient experience and quantify the impact of treatment delays and interruptions over the first month of the COVID-19 outbreak.
32368429,We also quantify the incidence of COVID-19 positive patients on census and provide guidance on proactive institutional policies to mitigate patient risk.
32368550,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a major public health emergency with obvious characteristics of human-to-human transmission, and there are infective asymptomatic carriers.
32368550,Early identification and proper management of patients with COVID-19 are important.
32368550,Features in chest computed tomography (CT) can facilitate identifying newly infected individuals.
32368550,However, CT findings of some lung contusions are similar to those of COVID-19, as shown in the present case.
32368550,A 46-year-old woman was admitted to hospital for backache and foot pain caused by a fall injury 1 d before hospitalization.
32368550,She was suspected of having COVID-19, since there was a confirmed COVID-19 case near her residence.
32368550,But she had no fever, cough, chest tightness, difficult breathing, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, <i>etc</i>.
32368550,On physical examination, the lower posterior chest of both sides showed dullness on percussion and moist rales at the end of inspiration on auscultation.
32368550,The white blood cell count and lymphocyte count were 10.88 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L and 1.04 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L, respectively.
32368550,CT performed on February 7, 2020 revealed that both lungs were scattered with patchy ground-glass opacity.
32368550,The patient was diagnosed with pulmonary contusion with thoracic spinal fracture (T12), calcaneal fracture, and pelvic fracture.
32368550,On day 9 after conservative treatment, her condition was alleviated.
32368550,On review of the chest CT, the previous shadows were significantly reduced.
32368550,Differential diagnosis of lung contusion and COVID-19 must be emphasized.
32368550,Both conditions require effective prompt actions, especially COVID-19.
32368570,The emerging infection of COVID-19 was initiated from Wuhan, China, have been spread to more than 210 countries around the globe including India.
32368570,The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 are very similar to other respiratory viruses.
32368570,The number of laboratory-confirmed cases and associated deaths are increasing regularly in various parts of the World.
32368570,Seven coronaviruses (229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, SARS, MERS and, COVID-19) can naturally infect human beings.
32368570,Out of these four (229E-CoV, NL63-CoV, OC43-CoV, HKU1-CoV) are responsible for mild upper respiratory infections, while SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and COVID-19 are well known for their high mortality.
32368570,Few mild strains of coronaviruses are circulating in India but there is no evidence of SARS and MERS outbreaks.
32368570,The COVID-19 is an emerging viral infection responsible for pandemics.
32368570,Fortunately, the mortality of COVID-19 is low as compared with SARS and MERS, the majority of its cases are recovered.
32368570,The death toll of COVID-19 is high even after its low mortality because COVID-19 causes a pandemic while SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cause epidemics only.
32368570,COVID-19 influenced the large segments of the world population, which led to a public health emergency of international concern, putting all health organizations on high alert.
32368570,COVID-19 is the first coronavirus after Spanish Flu 1918-1919, who has extremely influenced the health system, economy, and psychology of India.
32368570,The present study review is on the general continent, virology, pathogenesis, global epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment and control of COVID-19 with the reference to India.
32368712,African Americans are overrepresented among reported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases and deaths.
32368712,There are a multitude of factors that may explain the African American disparity in COVID-19 outcomes, including higher rates of comorbidities.
32368712,While individual-level factors predictably contribute to disparate COVID-19 outcomes, systematic and structural factors have not yet been reported.
32368712,It stands to reason that implicit biases may fuel the racial disparity in COVID-19 outcomes.
32368712,To address this racial disparity, we must apply a health equity lens and disaggregate data explicitly for African Americans, as well as other populations at risk for biased treatment in the health-care system.
32368875,A viral pneumonia rapidly spread from Wuhan, China to all countries in late 2019.
32368875,In February 2020, WHO named as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and declared the pandemic on March 11, 2020.
32368875,To prevent the spread of COVID-19, Ministry of Health of Republic of Turkey and international institutions have published documents defining hygiene rules.
32368875,After the lung computerized tomography (CT) findings which are important in the diagnosis of COVID-19 are described, protection measures against infection were defined in radiology departments.
32368875,There is no publication involving protection measures for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in nuclear medicine (NM) (appointment, patient acceptance, imaging and treatment procedures, disinfection etc).
32368875,There are two reports on CT findings suggesting COVID-19 in <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/CT scan.
32368875,These lung findings detected in hybrid images will be helpful in the early diagnosis of pulmonary involvement.
32368875,Infected cases may be asymptomatic and can unintentionally disseminate the virus to surrounding people.
32368875,This advisory guide has been prepared to avoid infection risk in NM clinics.
32368875,During the COVID-19 outbreak, staff must use proper personal protective equipment and patients should be evaluated as the elective case according to clinical status.
32368875,A questionnaire should be made for COVID-19.
32368875,In cancer cases requiring urgent treatment, radionuclide treatment (RNT) should be planned according to the COVID-19 test result.
32368875,If the result is negative, RNT can be applied; but if not or if the symptoms are present, RNT must be postponed.
32368875,Following imaging procedures, scanners and room surfaces should be cleaned by personnel with proper disinfection training. 2019’un sonlarında, viral pnömoni Wuhan, Çin’den hızla tüm ülkelere yayıldı.
32368875,Şubat 2020’de Dünya Sağlık Örgütü Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) olarak adlandırdı ve 11 Mart 2020’de pandemi geliştiğini açıkladı.
32368875,COVID-19 enfeksiyonunun yayılmasını önlemek için, TC.
32368875,Sağlık Bakanlığı ve uluslararası kurumlar hijyen kurallarını tanımlayan broşürler yayınladı.
32368875,Bilgisayarlı tomografi (BT) görüntülerinde COVID-19 tanısında önemli olan akciğer bulgularının tanımlanmasıyla radyoloji bölümlerinde enfeksiyondan korunma önlemleri açıklanmıştır.
32368875,Nükleer tıpta tanı ve tedavi işlemleri için (randevu vermek, hasta kabulü, görüntüleme ve tedavi işlemleri, dezenfeksiyon gibi) korunma önlemlerini içeren yayın yoktur. <sup>18</sup>F-florodeoksiglukoz pozitron emisyon tomografi/BT taramada COVID-19’u düşündüren BT bulguları hakkında iki yayın vardır.
32368875,Hibrid görüntülerde saptanan bu akciğer bulguları akciğer tutulumunun erken tanısında faydalı olacaktır.
32368875,Enfekte olgular asemptomatik olabilir ve farkında olmadan virüsü çevresindeki kişilere yayabilir.
32368875,Öneri niteliğindeki bu kılavuz Nükleer Tıp kliniklerinde enfeksiyon riskini önlemek amacı ile hazırlanmıştır.
32368875,COVID-19 salgını sırasında, personel uygun kişisel koruyucu ekipman kullanmalı ve hastalar klinik durumlarına göre elektif olgu olarak değerlendirilmelidir.
32368875,COVID-19 açısından anket yapılmalıdır.
32368875,Acil tedavi gereken kanser olgularında, COVID-19 test sonucuna göre radyonüklit tedavi (RNT) planlanmalıdır.
32368875,Sonuç negatif ise RNT uygulanabilir.
32368875,Sonuç pozitif ise veya semptomlar varsa, RNT ertelenmelidir.
32368875,Görüntüleme işlemlerinden sonra, tarayıcılar ve oda yüzeyleri dezenfeksiyon konusunda uygun eğitim almış personel tarafından temizlenmelidir.
32368884,Even though the early reports from China provided advance warning of what was to come, the COVID-19 pandemic has spread throughout the world with devastating consequences.
32368884,Emergency measures are being implemented to reduce the magnitude of the public health crisis, prevent healthcare facilities from becoming overwhelmed and reduce the death toll of the disease.
32368884,Containment strategies to mitigate viral transmission and emergency measures to increase the capacity of each country to provide intensive care are at the forefront of the public health management of the epidemic, even though the detrimental social and psychological effects of quarantine are evident on a global scale.
32368884,Optimal management of critically ill patients with COVID-19 is also unclear, and the initial suggestion for early intubation as in typical ARDS may have caused significant harm.
32368884,The management of mild cases of confirmed infection is another point of controversy, as drugs which may be repurposed for COVID-19 treatment have significant, potentially irreversible toxic effects and their use in mild cases of a viral illness which is typically self-limited may be harmful.
32368894,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to a major shortage of N95 respirators, which are essential for protecting healthcare professionals and the general public who may come into contact with the virus.
32368894,Thus, it is essential to determine how we can reuse respirators and other personal protective equipment in these urgent times.
32368894,We investigated multiple commonly used disinfection schemes on media with particle filtration efficiency of 95%.
32368894,Heating was recently found to inactivate the virus in solution within 5 min at 70 °C and is among the most scalable, user-friendly methods for viral disinfection.
32368894,We found that heat (≤85 °C) under various humidities (≤100% relative humidity, RH) was the most promising, nondestructive method for the preservation of filtration properties in meltblown fabrics as well as N95-grade respirators.
32368894,At 85 °C, 30% RH, we were able to perform 50 cycles of heat treatment without significant changes in the filtration efficiency.
32368894,At low humidity or dry conditions, temperatures up to 100 °C were not found to alter the filtration efficiency significantly within 20 cycles of treatment.
32368894,Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation was a secondary choice, which was able to withstand 10 cycles of treatment and showed small degradation by 20 cycles.
32368894,However, UV can potentially impact the material strength and subsequent sealing of respirators.
32368894,Finally, treatments involving liquids and vapors require caution, as steam, alcohol, and household bleach all may lead to degradation of the filtration efficiency, leaving the user vulnerable to the viral aerosols.
32369030,Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first reported on December 31, 2019.
32369030,Because it has only been studied for just over three months, our understanding of this disease is still incomplete, particularly regarding its sequelae and long-term outcomes.
32369030,Moreover, very little has been written about the rehabilitation needs of patients with COVID-19 after discharge from acute care.
32369030,The objective of this report is to answer the question &quot;What rehabilitation services do survivors of COVID-19 require?
32369030,&quot; The question was asked within the context of a subacute hospital delivering geriatric inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation services.
32369030,Three areas relevant to rehabilitation after COVID-19 were identified.
32369030,First, details of how patients may present have been summarized, including comorbidities, complications from an intensive care unit stay with or without intubation, and the effects of the virus on multiple body systems, including those pertaining to cardiac, neurological, cognitive, and mental health.
32369030,Second, I have suggested procedures regarding the design of inpatient rehabilitation units for COVID-19 survivors, staffing issues, and considerations for outpatient rehabilitation.
32369030,Third, guidelines for rehabilitation (physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech-language pathology) following COVID-19 have been proposed with respect to recovery of the respiratory system as well as recovery of mobility and function.
32369030,A thorough assessment and an individualized, progressive treatment plan which focuses on function, disability, and return to participation in society will help each patient to maximize their function and quality of life.
32369030,Careful consideration of the rehabilitation environment will ensure that all patients recover as completely as possible.
32369097,The role of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) in the setting of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is hotly debated.
32369097,There have been recommendations to discontinue these medications, which are essential in the treatment of several chronic disease conditions, while, in the absence of clinical evidence, professional societies have advocated their continued use.
32369097,To study the association between use of ACEIs/ARBs with the likelihood of testing positive for COVID-19 and to study outcome data in subsets of patients taking ACEIs/ARBs who tested positive with severity of clinical outcomes of COVID-19 (eg, hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, and requirement for mechanical ventilation).
32369097,Retrospective cohort study with overlap propensity score weighting was conducted at the Cleveland Clinic Health System in Ohio and Florida.
32369097,All patients tested for COVID-19 between March 8 and April 12, 2020, were included.
32369097,History of taking ACEIs or ARBs at the time of COVID-19 testing.
32369097,Results of COVID-19 testing in the entire cohort, number of patients requiring hospitalizations, intensive care unit admissions, and mechanical ventilation among those who tested positive.
32369097,A total of 18 472 patients tested for COVID-19.
32369097,The mean (SD) age was 49 (21) years, 7384 (40%) were male, and 12 725 (69%) were white.
32369097,Of 18 472 patients who underwent COVID-19 testing, 2285 (12.4%) were taking either ACEIs or ARBs.
32369097,A positive COVID-19 test result was observed in 1735 of 18 472 patients (9.4%).
32369097,Among patients who tested positive, 421 (24.3%) were admitted to the hospital, 161 (9.3%) were admitted to an intensive care unit, and 111 (6.4%) required mechanical ventilation.
32369097,Overlap propensity score weighting showed no significant association of ACEI and/or ARB use with COVID-19 test positivity (overlap propensity score-weighted odds ratio, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.81-1.15).
32369097,This study found no association between ACEI or ARB use and COVID-19 test positivity.
32369097,These clinical data support current professional society guidelines to not discontinue ACEIs or ARBs in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic.
32369097,However, further study in larger numbers of hospitalized patients receiving ACEI and ARB therapy is needed to determine the association with clinical measures of COVID-19 severity.
32369191,Tocilizumab, an interleukin-6 inhibitor, may ameliorate the inflammatory manifestations associated with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and thus improve clinical outcomes.
32369191,This was a retrospective review of patients with laboratory-confirmed severe COVID-19 who received tocilizumab and completed 14 days of follow up.
32369191,Twenty-five patients were included, median age was 58 years (interquartile range, 50-63) and the majority were males (92%).
32369191,Co-morbidities included diabetes mellitus (48%), chronic kidney disease (16%), and cardiovascular disease (12%).
32369191,Fever (92%), cough (84%), and dyspnea (72%) were the commonest presenting symptoms.
32369191,All patients received at least two concomitant investigational antiviral agents.
32369191,Median oral temperature was on day 1, 3, and 7 was 38.0°C, 37.3°C (P = .043), and 37.0°C (P = .064), respectively.
32369191,Corresponding median C-reactive protein was 193 and 7.9 mg/L (P &lt; .0001) and &lt;6 mg/L (P = .0001).
32369191,Radiological improvement was noted in 44% of patients by day 7% and 68% by day 14.
32369191,Nine patients (36%) were discharged alive from intensive care unit and three (12%) died.
32369191,The proportion of patients on invasive ventilation declined from (84%) at the time of tocilizumab initiation to 60% on day 7 (P = .031) and 28% on day 14 (P = .001).
32369191,The majority (92%) of patients experienced at least one adverse event.
32369191,However, it is not possible to ascertain which adverse events were directly related to tocilizumab therapy.
32369191,In patients with severe COVID-19, tocilizumab was associated with dramatic decline in inflammatory markers, radiological improvement and reduced ventilatory support requirements.
32369191,Given the study's limitations, the results require assessment in adequately powered randomized controlled trials.
32369192,As I organize a pile of ethics consult chart notes in New York City in mid-April 2020, I look at the ten cases that I have co-consulted on recently.
32369192,Nine of the patients were found to be Covid positive.
32369192,The reasons for the consults are mostly familiar-surrogate decision-making, informed refusal of treatment, goals of care, defining futility.
32369192,But the context is unfamiliar and unsettling.
32369192,Bioethicists are in pandemic mode, dusting off and revising triage plans.
32369192,Patients and potential patients are fearful-of the disease itself and of the amplification of health disparities and inequities.
32369192,There is so much to contemplate, but as I go through my cases, I worry about disability, about biases and racist stereotypes.
32369192,In this pandemic, historically marginalized communities are at risk of further disenfranchisement.
32369205,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has evolved into a pandemic rapidly.
32369205,The majority of COVID-19 patients are with mild syndromes.
32369205,This study aimed to develop models for predicting disease progression in mild cases.
32369205,The risk factors for the requirement of oxygen support in mild COVID-19 were explored using multivariate logistic regression.
32369205,Nomogram as visualization of the models was developed using R software.
32369205,A total of 344 patients with mild COVID-19 were included in the final analysis, 45 of whom progressed and needed high-flow oxygen therapy or mechanical ventilation after admission.
32369205,There were 188 (54.7%) males, and the average age of the cohort was 52.9 ± 16.8 years.
32369205,When the laboratory data were not included in multivariate analysis, diabetes, coronary heart disease, T ≥ 38.5℃ and sputum were independent risk factors of progressive COVID-19 (Model 1).
32369205,When the blood routine test was included the CHD, T ≥ 38.5℃ and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio were found to be independent predictors (Model 2).
32369205,The area under the receiver operator characteristic curve of model 2 was larger than model 1 (0.872 vs 0.849, P = .023).
32369205,The negative predictive value of both models was greater than 96%, indicating they could serve as simple tools for ruling out the possibility of disease progression.
32369205,In conclusion, two models comprised common symptoms (fever and sputum), underlying diseases (diabetes and coronary heart disease) and blood routine test are developed for predicting the future requirement of oxygen support in mild COVID-19 cases.
32369208,Clinical and laboratory data available on patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Beijing, China remain extremely limited.
32369208,Here, we summarized the clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 in a designated hospital in Beijing, China. 55 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were admitted to Beijing 302 Hospital and enrolled in this study.
32369208,Demographic data, symptoms, comorbidities, laboratory values, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected and retrospectively analyzed.
32369208,15 (27.3%) of the patients had non-severe symptom, the mean age was 44.0 years (interquartile range 34.0-56.0), and median incubation period was 7.5 days (interquartile range 5.0-11.8).
32369208,26 (47.3%) patients had exposure history in Wuhan while 20 (36.4%) were associated with familial clusters.
32369208,18 (32.7%) had underlying comorbidities including hypertension.
32369208,The most common symptoms of illness were fever (45, 81.8%), 51 (92.7%) patients had abnormal findings on chest CT.
32369208,Laboratory findings showed that neutrophil count, percentage of lymphocyte, percentage of eosinophil, eosinophil count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, albumin, and serum ferritin are potential risk factors for patients with poor prognosis. 26 patients (47.3%) were still hospitalized while 29 (52.7%) had been discharged at this point.
32369208,Compared with patients in Wuhan, the symptoms of patients in Beijing are relatively mild.
32369208,Older age, more comorbidities, and more abnormal prominent laboratory markers were associated with severe condition.
32369208,On the basis of antiviral drugs, antibiotics treatment, appropriate dosage of corticosteroid and gamma globulin therapy significantly improve patients' outcomes.
32369208,Early identification and timely medical treatment are important to reduce the severity of patients with COVID-19.

32369222,In December 2019, a novel coronavirus causing severe acute respiratory disease occurred in Wuhan, China.
32369222,It is an emerging infectious disease with widespread and rapid infectiousness.
32369222,The World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern on 31 January 2020.
32369222,Severe COVID-19 patients should be managed and treated in a critical care unit.
32369222,Performing a chest X-ray/CT can judge the severity of the disease.
32369222,The management of COVID-19 patients includes epidemiological risk and patient isolation; treatment entails general supportive care, respiratory support, symptomatic treatment, nutritional support, psychological intervention, etc.
32369222,The prognosis of the patients depends upon the severity of the disease, the patient's age, the underlying diseases of the patients, and the patient's overall medical condition.
32369222,The management of COVID-19 should focus on early diagnosis, immediate isolation, general and optimized supportive care, and infection prevention and control.
32369429,To determine the pooled global prevalence of olfactory and gustatory dysfunction in patients with the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19).
32369429,Literature searches of PubMed, Embase, and Scopus were conducted on April 19, 2020, to include articles written in English that reported the prevalence of olfactory or gustatory dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
32369429,Search strategies developed for each database contained keywords such as <i>anosmia, dysgeusia</i>, and <i>COVID-19</i>.
32369429,Resulting articles were imported into a systematic review software and underwent screening.
32369429,Data from articles that met inclusion criteria were extracted and analyzed.
32369429,Meta-analysis using pooled prevalence estimates in a random-effects model were calculated.
32369429,Ten studies were analyzed for olfactory dysfunction (n = 1627), demonstrating 52.73% (95% CI, 29.64%-75.23%) prevalence among patients with COVID-19.
32369429,Nine studies were analyzed for gustatory dysfunction (n = 1390), demonstrating 43.93% (95% CI, 20.46%-68.95%) prevalence.
32369429,Subgroup analyses were conducted for studies evaluating olfactory dysfunction using nonvalidated and validated instruments and demonstrated 36.64% (95% CI, 18.31%-57.24%) and 86.60% (95% CI, 72.95%-95.95%) prevalence, respectively.
32369429,Olfactory and gustatory dysfunction are common symptoms in patients with COVID-19 and may represent early symptoms in the clinical course of infection.
32369429,Increased awareness of this fact may encourage earlier diagnosis and treatment, as well as heighten vigilance for viral transmission.
32369429,To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis to report on the prevalence of these symptoms in COVID-19 patients.
32369431,As otolaryngologists, we identify as subspecialists and fellowship-trained surgeons and may even identify as &quot;super-subspecialists.&quot; The likelihood of being redeployed and drawing from knowledge learned during our postgraduate year 1 training seemed exceedingly unlikely until physician resources became scarce in some health care systems during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32369431,More now than ever, it is evident that our broad training is valuable in helping patients and allowing the otolaryngologist to meaningfully contribute to the larger health care community, especially while the majority (70%-95%) of elective care is delayed.
32369431,With our skill set, otolaryngologists are poised to support various aspects of hospital wards, intensive care units, emergency departments, and beyond.
32369433,<b>Background:</b> The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted health care systems' vulnerabilities.
32369433,Hospitals face increasing risk of periods of scarcity of life-sustaining resources such as ventilators for mechanical respiratory support, as has been the case in Italy as of March, 2020.
32369433,The National Academy of Medicine has provided guidance on crisis standards of care, which call for the reallocation of scarce medical resources to those who will benefit most during extreme situations.
32369433,Given that this will require a departure from the usual fiduciary duty of the bedside clinician, we determined and mapped potential barriers to the implementation of the guidelines from stakeholders using an implementation science framework. <b>Methods:</b> A protocol was created to operationalize national and state guidelines for triaging ventilators during crisis conditions.
32369433,Focus groups and key informant interviews were conducted from July-September 2018 with clinicians at three acute care hospitals of an urban academic medical center.
32369433,Respiratory therapists, intensivists, nursing leadership and the palliative care interdisciplinary team participated in focus groups.
32369433,Key informant interviews were conducted with emergency management, respiratory therapy and emergency medicine.
32369433,Subjects were presented the protocol and their reflections were elicited using a semi-structured interview guide.
32369433,Data from transcripts and notes were categorized using a coding strategy based on the Theoretical Domains Framework. <b>Results:</b> Participants anticipated that implementing this protocol would challenge their roles and identities as clinicians including both their fiduciary duty to the patient and their decision-making autonomy.
32369433,Despite this, many participants acknowledged the need for such a protocol to standardize care and minimize bias as well as to mitigate potential consequences for individual clinicians.
32369433,Participants identified the question of considering patient quality of life in triage decisions as an important and unresolved ethical issue in disaster triage. <b>Conclusion:</b> Clinicians' discomfort with shifting roles and obligations could pose implementation barriers for crisis standards of care.
32369479,Michel Goldman and colleagues call on the European medical and scientific community to coordinate efforts on immunotherapy-based approaches to coronavirus.
32369601,Because of the increased risk in cancer patients of developing complications caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), physicians have to balance the competing risks of the negative impact of the pandemic and the primary tumor.
32369601,In this consensus statement, an international group of experts present mitigation strategies and treatment guidance for patients suffering from high grade gliomas (HGG) during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. 16 international experts in the treatment of HGG contributed to this consensus-based practice recommendation including neuro-oncologists, neurosurgeons, radiation -oncologists and a medical physicist.
32369601,Generally, treatment of neuro-oncological patients cannot be significantly delayed and initiating therapy should not be outweighed by COVID-19.
32369601,We present detailed interdisciplinary treatment strategies for molecular subgroups in two pandemic scenarios, a scale-up phase and a crisis phase.
32369601,This practice recommendation presents a pragmatic framework and consensus-based mitigation strategies for the treatment of HGG patients during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
32369624,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a tremendous global impact since it began in November of 2019.
32369624,However, there are concerns that the COVID-19 pandemic will not affect all equally and some populations will be particularly vulnerable.
32369624,Relevant to liver disease, patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD) and alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) may be amongst the populations that are the most severely impacted.
32369624,The reasons for this include being at a higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection due to a depressed immune system and high-risk underlying comorbidities, the injurious effect of COVID-19 on the liver, the inability to attend regular visits with providers, diversion of hospital resources, and social isolation leading to psychological decompensation and increased drinking or relapse.
32369624,As a result, we fear that there will be a dramatic rising tide of alcohol relapse, admissions for decompensated ALD, and an increase in newly diagnosed patients with AUD/ALD post-COVID-19 pandemic.
32369624,Providers and their institutions should implement pre-emptive strategies such as telehealth and aggressive patient outreach programs now to curb this anticipated problem.
32369624,Liver transplantation (LT) centers should adapt to the pandemic by considering leniency to some LT candidates with ALD who cannot access appropriate alcohol treatment due to the current situation.
32369624,In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic will likely be especially detrimental to patients with AUD/ALD and actions need to be taken now to limit the scope of this anticipated problem.
32370561,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by novel enveloped single stranded RNA coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), is responsible for an ongoing global pandemic.
32370561,While other countries deployed widespread testing as an early mitigation strategy, the U.S. experienced delays in development and deployment of organism identification assays.
32370561,As such, there is uncertainty surrounding disease burden and community spread, severely hampering containment efforts.
32370561,COVID-19 illuminates the need for a tiered diagnostic approach to rapidly identify clinically significant infections and reduce disease spread.
32370561,Without the ability to efficiently screen patients, hospitals are overwhelmed, potentially delaying treatment for other emergencies.
32370561,A multi-tiered, diagnostic strategy incorporating a rapid host immune response assay as a screening test, molecular confirmatory testing and rapid IgM/IgG testing to assess benefit from quarantine/further testing and provide information on population exposure/herd immunity would efficiently evaluate potential COVID-19 patients.
32370561,Triaging patients within minutes with a fingerstick rather than hours/days after an invasive swab is critical to pandemic response as reliance on the existing strategy is limited by assay accuracy, time to results, and testing capacity.
32370561,Early screening and triage is achievable from the outset of a pandemic with point-of-care host immune response testing which will improve response time to clinical and public health actions.Key messagesDelayed testing deployment has led to uncertainty surrounding overall disease burden and community spread, severely hampering public health containment and healthcare system preparation efforts.A multi-tiered testing strategy incorporating rapid, host immune point-of-care tests can be used now and for future pandemic planning by effectively identifying patients at risk of disease thereby facilitating quarantine earlier in the progression of the outbreak during the weeks and months it can take for pathogen specific confirmatory tests to be developed, validated and manufactured in sufficient quantities.The ability to triage patients at the point of care and support the guidance of medical and therapeutic decisions, for viral isolation or confirmatory testing or for appropriate treatment of COVID-19 and/or bacterial infections, is a critical component to our national pandemic response and there is an urgent need to implement the proposed strategy to combat the current outbreak.
32370758,A new human coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 was identified in several cases of acute respiratory syndrome in Wuhan, China in December 2019.
32370758,On March 11 2020, WHO declared the SARS-CoV-2 infection to be a pandemic, based on the involvement of 169 nations.
32370758,Specific drugs for SARS-CoV-2 are obviously not available.
32370758,Currently, drugs originally developed for other viruses or parasites are currently in clinical trials based on empiric data.
32370758,In the quest of an effective antiviral drug, the most specific target for an RNA virus is the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) which shows significant differences between positive-sense and negative-sense RNA viruses.
32370758,An accurate evaluation of RdRps from different viruses may guide the development of new drugs or the repositioning of already approved antiviral drugs as treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
32370758,This can accelerate the containment of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and, hopefully, of future pandemics due to other emerging zoonotic RNA viruses.
32370766,The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has led to a global struggle to cope with the sheer numbers of infected persons, many of whom require intensive care support or eventually succumb to the illness.
32370766,The outbreak is managed by a combination of disease containment via public health measures and supportive care for those who are affected.
32370766,To date, there is no specific anti-COVID-19 treatment.
32370766,However, the urgency to identify treatments that could turn the tide has led to the emergence of several investigational drugs as potential candidates to improve outcome, especially in the severe to critically ill.
32370766,While many of these adjunctive drugs are being investigated in clinical trials, professional bodies have attempted to clarify the setting where the use of these drugs may be considered as off-label or compassionate use.
32370766,This review summarizes the clinical evidence of investigational adjunctive treatments used in COVID-19 patients as well as the recommendations of their use from guidelines issued by international and national organizations in healthcare.
32370981,The recent COVID-19 pandemic has led to major organisational changes in health care settings, especially in psychiatric hospitals.
32370981,We conducted a national online survey to assess the evolution of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in the different centres practicing this treatment. 65 responses from all over France were analysed.
32370981,More than 90 % of the centres practising ECT experienced a decrease in their activity.
32370981,Half of the centres experienced a total cessation of activity and 25 % of the centres experienced a decrease of more than half of their usual activity.
32370981,Post-pandemic COVID-19 psychiatric care is expected to be difficult.
32370981,It is essential not to add to this difficulty the complications, often serious, that will be associated with delaying or stopping the practice of ECT.
32370981,It will also be necessary to remain vigilant with regard to the specific neuropsychiatric consequences that will follow the pandemic.
32370982,The lack of resources and coordination to face the coronavirus epidemic raises concerns for the health of patients with mental disorders in a country where we still have memories of the dramatic experience of famine in psychiatric hospitals during the Second World War.
32370982,This article aims to propose guidance to ensure mental health care during the SARS-CoV epidemic in France.
32370982,The authors performed a narrative review identifying relevant results in the scientific and medical literature and in local initiatives in France.
32370982,We identified four types of major vulnerabilities among patients with mental disorders during this pandemic: (1) medical comorbidities that are more frequently found among patients with mental disorders (cardiovascular and pulmonary pathologies, diabetes, obesity, etc.) which are risk factors for severe covid-19 infection; (2) age (the elderly form the population most vulnerable to the coronavirus); (3) cognitive and behavioural disorders, which can hamper compliance with confinement and hygiene measures and finally and (4) psychosocial vulnerability as a result of stigmatization and/or socio-economic difficulties.
32370982,Furthermore, the mental health healthcare system is more vulnerable than other healthcare systems.
32370982,Current government plans are poorly suited to psychiatric establishments in a context of major shortages of organizational, material and human resources.
32370982,In addition, a certain number of structural aspects make the psychiatric institution particularly vulnerable: many beds have been closed, wards have high densities of patients, mental health community facilities are closed, and medical teams are understaffed and poorly trained to face infectious diseases.
32370982,There are also major issues when referring patients with acute mental disorders to intensive care units.
32370982,To maintain the continuity of psychiatric care in this pandemic situation, several directions can be considered, in particular with the creation of &quot;COVID+ units&quot;.
32370982,These units are under the dual supervision of a psychiatrist and an internist/infectious disease specialist; all new entrants are placed in quarantine for 14 days; the nursing staff receives specific training, daily medical check-ups and close psychological support.
32370982,Family visits are prohibited and replaced by videoconference.
32370982,At the end of hospitalization, in particular for the population of patients in compulsory ambulatory care situations, specific case-management are organized with the possibility of home visits, in order to support patients when they get back home and to help them cope with the experience of confinement, which is liable to induce recurrences of mental disorders.
32370982,The total or partial closure of community mental health facilities is particularly disturbing for patients, but a regular follow-up is possible with telemedicine and should include the monitoring of suicide risk and psycho-education strategies; developing support platforms could also be very helpful in this context.
32370982,Private practice psychiatrists also have a crucial role of information towards their patients on confinement and barrier measures, and also on measures to prevent the psychological risks inherent in confinement: maintenance of regular sleep r, physical exercise, social interactions, stress management and coping strategies, prevention of addictions, etc.
32370982,They should also be trained to prevent, detect and treat early warning symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, because their prevalence was high in the regions of China most affected by the pandemic.
32370982,French mental healthcare is now facing a great and urgent need for reorganization and must also prepare in the coming days and weeks to face an epidemic of emotional disorders due to the confinement of the general population.
32370984,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused major sanitary crisis worldwide.
32370984,Half of the world has been placed in quarantine.
32370984,In France, this large-scale health crisis urgently triggered the restructuring and reorganization of health service delivery to support emergency services, medical intensive care units and continuing care units.
32370984,Health professionals mobilized all their resources to provide emergency aid in a general climate of uncertainty.
32370984,Concerns about the mental health, psychological adjustment, and recovery of health care workers treating and caring for patients with COVID-19 are now arising.
32370984,The goal of the present article is to provide up-to-date information on potential mental health risks associated with exposure of health professionals to the COVID-19 pandemic.
32370984,Authors performed a narrative review identifying relevant results in the scientific and medical literature considering previous epidemics of 2003 (SARS-CoV-1) and 2009 (H1N1) with the more recent data about the COVID-19 pandemic.
32370984,We highlighted most relevant data concerning the disease characteristics, the organizational factors and personal factors that may contribute to developing psychological distress and other mental health symptoms.
32370984,The disease characteristics of the current COVID-19 pandemic provoked a generalized climate of wariness and uncertainty, particularly among health professionals, due to a range of causes such as the rapid spread of COVID-19, the severity of symptoms it can cause in a segment of infected individuals, the lack of knowledge of the disease, and deaths among health professionals.
32370984,Stress may also be caused by organizational factors, such as depletion of personal protection equipment, concerns about not being able to provide competent care if deployed to new area, concerns about rapidly changing information, lack of access to up-to-date information and communication, lack of specific drugs, the shortage of ventilators and intensive care unit beds necessary to care for the surge of critically ill patients, and significant change in their daily social and family life.
32370984,Further risk factors have been identified, including feelings of being inadequately supported, concerns about health of self, fear of taking home infection to family members or others, and not having rapid access to testing through occupational health if needed, being isolated, feelings of uncertainty and social stigmatization, overwhelming workload, or insecure attachment.
32370984,Additionally, we discussed positive social and organizational factors that contribute to enhance resilience in the face of the pandemic.
32370984,There is a consensus in all the relevant literature that health care professionals are at an increased risk of high levels of stress, anxiety, depression, burnout, addiction and post-traumatic stress disorder, which could have long-term psychological implications.
32370984,In the long run, this tragic health crisis should significantly enhance our understanding of the mental health risk factors among the health care professionals facing the COVID-19 pandemic.
32370984,Reporting information such as this is essential to plan future prevention strategies.
32370984,Protecting health care professionals is indeed an important component of public health measures to address large-scale health crisis.
32370984,Thus, interventions to promote mental well-being in health care professionals exposed to COVID-19 need to be immediately implemented, and to strengthen prevention and response strategies by training health care professionals on mental help and crisis management.
32370986,With the multiplication of COVID-19 severe acute respiratory syndrome cases due to SARS-COV2, some concerns about angiotensin-converting enzyme 1 (ACE1) inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARB) have emerged.
32370986,Since the ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) enzyme is the receptor that allows SARS COV2 entry into cells, the fear was that pre-existing treatment with ACEi or ARB might increase the risk of developing severe or fatal severe acute respiratory syndrome in case of COVID-19 infection.
32370986,The present article discusses these concerns.
32370986,ACE2 is a membrane-bound enzyme (carboxypeptidase) that contributes to the inactivation of angiotensin II and therefore physiologically counters angiotensin II effects.
32370986,ACEis do not inhibit ACE2.
32370986,Although ARBs have been shown to up-regulate ACE2 tissue expression in experimental animals, evidence was not always consistent in human studies.
32370986,Moreover, to date there is no evidence that ACEi or ARB administration facilitates SARS-COV2 cell entry by increasing ACE2 tissue expression in either animal or human studies.
32370986,Finally, some studies support the hypothesis that elevated ACE2 membrane expression and tissue activity by administration of ARB and/or infusion of soluble ACE2 could confer protective properties against inflammatory tissue damage in COVID-19 infection.
32370986,In summary, based on the currently available evidence and as advocated by many medical societies, ACEi or ARB should not be discontinued because of concerns with COVID-19 infection, except when the hemodynamic situation is precarious and case-by-case adjustment is required.
32371027,Consensus on Science and Treatment recommendations aim to balance the benefits of early resuscitation with the potential for harm to care providers during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32371027,Chest compressions and cardiopulmonary resuscitation have the potential to generate aerosols.
32371027,During the current COVID-19 pandemic lay rescuers should consider compressions and public-access defibrillation.
32371027,Lay rescuers who are willing, trained and able to do so, should consider providing rescue breaths to infants and children in addition to chest compressions.
32371027,Healthcare professionals should use personal protective equipment for aerosol generating procedures during resuscitation and may consider defibrillation before donning personal protective equipment for aerosol generating procedures.
32371230,According to data compiled by researchers at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, more than two and half million cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a newly discovered virus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), have been confirmed on April 20, 2020 (Nature, 2020b).
32371230,Since the emergence of this infectious disease in Asia (Wuhan, China) late last year, it has been subsequently span to every continent of the world except Antarctica (Rodríguez-Morales et al., 2020).
32371230,Along with a foothold in every country, the current disease pandemic is disrupting practically every aspect of life all over the world.
32371230,As the outbreak are continuing to evolve, several research activities have been conducted for better understanding the origin, functions, treatments, and preventions of this novel coronavirus.
32371230,This review will be a summa of the key features of novel coronavirus (nCoV), the virus causing disease 2019 and the present epidemic situation worldwide up to April 20, 2020.
32371230,It is expected that this record will play an important role to take more preventive measures for overcoming the challenges faced during this current pandemic.
32371416,The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first reported in Wuhan, China, in late 2019 and has affected more than 1 270 000 people worldwide.
32371416,The numbers of reported cases continue to rise and threaten global health.
32371416,Transmissions among family members are frequently observed, although the route of transmission is partially known.
32371416,Here we report three cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection within one family.
32371416,Sequencing of the S gene of the viral genome showed 100% identity among samples, suggesting that the same strain caused the infection.
32371416,Following treatment with oseltamivir and short-term methylprednisolone combined with symptomatic management, all three patients recovered within 3 weeks, as evidenced by the disappearance of their symptoms, clearance of pulmonary infiltrates and consecutive negative molecular diagnostic test findings.
32371416,Our observations suggest the importance of preventing family transmission and the efficacy of current integrated treatment for mild/moderate pneumonia in COVID-19 cases.
32371479,Early reports suggest that tocilizumab, an IL6 receptor-blocking antibody used to manage toxicities associated with chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, may help control cytokine storms in people infected with COVID-19.
32371479,Preliminary data from randomized trials are less clear-cut.
32371555,Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a means of cardiopulmonary support for refractory respiratory and cardiac failure.
32371555,ECMO is a resource-intensive therapy that can be considered in highly selected patients.
32371555,Expert centers should employ an evidence-based ARDS treatment algorithm and a multidisciplinary approach to recommending ECMO upon failure of conventional therapy.
32371555,Caring for ECMO patients requires adequate infection control and safety precautions for healthcare workers.
32371557,Patients with COVID-19 and acute cardiac injury as measured by an elevated high-sensitivity troponin I or troponin T upon admission or during hospitalization have a mortality rate of over 50% in initial reports.
32371557,The mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 and associated myocardial injury, whether SARS-CoV-2 patients with myocardial injury are a distinct population, and possible treatment options for myocardial injury associated with SARS-CoV-2 are unknown.
32371558,Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has multiple potential antiviral mechanisms of action that differ according to the pathogen studied (eg, Chikungunya, Dengue virus, human immunodeficiency virus, poliovirus, Zika virus).
32371558,Data on HCQ for treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are rapidly evolving.
32371558,To date there is no evidence from randomized controlled trials that any single therapy improves outcomes in patients infected with COVID-19.
32371558,There are also no clinical trial data supporting prophylactic HCQ therapy in COVID-19.
32371558,Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) use in patients with COVID-19 is being investigated examining prophylaxis, postexposure prophylaxis, and treatment regimens.
32371560,Positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy is an open system that can generate contact, droplet, and airborne COVID-19 thereby increasing the risk of transmission of COVID-19 like other procedures such as tracheal intubation, noninvasive ventilation, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
32371560,Medically prudent recommendations have been established for home use of PAP therapy in asymptomatic patients and patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.
32371560,Recommendations for sleep clinics and sleep laboratory activities are also discussed as well as the emergency use of PAP devices as a substitute for ventilation.
32371561,During the COVID-19 pandemic, Cleveland Clinic has put in place several pulmonary function testing precautions to reduce the risk of infection.
32371561,Precautions include efforts to perform only essential testing, wear personal protective equipment, reduce exposure to aerosolized particles, manage virtually by phone conference, conserve scare medications, clean equipment as recommended, consolidate testing, and defer testing.
32371562,No specific data exists regarding management of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) who are infected with COVID-19.
32371562,Based on expert opinion, strategies for outpatient management include use of elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor to reduce pulmonary exacerbations, telemedicine, adherence to prescribed regimens, prompt and aggressive treatment of CF exacerbations, and communication about COVID-19 with patients with CF.
32371562,Strategies for inpatient management may vary due to special precautions to avoid the aerosolization of COVID-19 with the use of nebulized medications and other therapies.
32371563,Current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines state that patients with moderate to severe asthma may be at greater risk for more severe disease if infected with SARS-CoV-2; however, no published data support this suggestion.
32371563,During this pandemic, it is recommended that patients with asthma continue taking all controller inhalers and other asthma medication as prescribed to prevent exacerbations and limit outpatient clinic and emergency room exposure.
32371563,Symptoms that may differentiate COVID-19 from asthma exacerbations caused by another trigger may include fever, fatigue, anorexia, or myalgias.
32371563,Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should avoid nebulizer treatments due to the risk of aerosolization.
32371624,The global outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has created an unprecedented challenge to the society.
32371624,Currently, the United States stands as the most affected country, and the entire healthcare system is affected, from emergency department, intensive care unit, post-acute care, outpatient, to home care.
32371624,Considering the debility, neurological, pulmonary, neuromuscular and cognitive complications, rehabilitation professionals can play an important role in the recovery process for individuals with COVID-19.
32371624,Clinicians across the nation's rehabilitation system have already begun working to initiate intensive care unit-based rehabilitation care and develop programs, settings and specialized care to meet the short- and long-term needs of these individuals.
32371624,We describe the anticipated rehabilitation demands, and the strategies to meet the needs of this population.
32371624,The complications from COVID-19 can be reduced by (1) delivering interdisciplinary rehabilitation that is initiated early and continued throughout the acute hospital stay, (2) providing patient/family education for self-care after discharge from inpatient rehabilitation at either acute or subacute settings, and (3) continuing rehabilitation care in the outpatient setting, and at home through ongoing therapy either in-person or via telehealth.
32372072,The purpose of this study was to describe the process and cost of delivering a physical therapist-guided synchronous telehealth exercise program appropriate for older adults with functional limitations.
32372072,Such programs may help alleviate some of the detrimental impacts of social distancing and quarantine on older adults at-risk of decline.
32372072,Data were derived from the feasibility arm of a parent study, which piloted the telehealth program for 36 sessions with 1 participant.
32372072,The steps involved in each phase (ie, development, delivery) were documented, along with participant and program provider considerations for each step.
32372072,Time-driven activity-based costing was used to track all costs over the course of the study.
32372072,Costs were categorized as program development or delivery and estimated per session and per participant.
32372072,A list of the steps and the participant and provider considerations involved in developing and delivering a synchronous telehealth exercise program for older adults with functional impairments was developed.
32372072,Resources used, fixed and variable costs, per-session cost estimates, and total cost per person were reported.
32372072,Two potential measures of the &quot;value proposition&quot; of this type of intervention were also reported.
32372072,Per-session cost of $158 appears to be a feasible business case, especially if the physical therapist to trained assistant personnel mix could be improved.
32372072,The findings provide insight into the process and costs of developing and delivering telehealth exercise programs for older adults with functional impairments.
32372072,The information presented may provide a &quot;blue print&quot; for developing and implementing new telehealth programs or for transitioning in-person services to telehealth delivery during periods of social distancing and quarantine.
32372072,As movement experts, physical therapists are uniquely positioned to play an important role in the current COVID-19 pandemic and to help individuals who are at risk of functional decline during periods of social distancing and quarantine.
32372072,Lessons learned from this study's experience can provide guidance on the process and cost of developing and delivering a telehealth exercise program for older adults with functional impairments.
32372072,The findings also can inform new telehealth programs, as well as assist in transitioning in-person care to a telehealth format in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
32372573,The world is entering an era of disaster and chaos due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.
32372573,Since its first emergence in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, COVID-19 has swept through Asia and propagated throughout the world to Europe and North America.
32372573,As of April 13, 1,773,084 people were infected and 111,652 people had died from COVID-19 globally, and new record levels of infection are being reported every day.
32372573,Based on the data that have been amassed so far, the primary risk factors for a severe disease course or even mortality from COVID-19 are underlying diseases such as diabetes and hypertension.
32372573,As the global prevalence of diabetes continues to increase, patients with endocrine diseases such as diabetes mellitus and those who are on long-term corticosteroid therapy due to adrenal insufficiency or hypopituitarism are at risk for a poor prognosis of COVID-19.
32372573,As endocrinologists, we would like to briefly review the current knowledge about the relationship between COVID-19 and endocrine diseases and to discuss what we can do for the safety and health of our patients with endocrine diseases in this globally threatening situation.
32372695,More than 2,000,000 individuals worldwide have had coronavirus 2019 disease infection (COVID-19), yet there is no effective medical therapy.
32372695,Multiple off-label and investigational drugs, such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, have gained broad interest due to positive pre-clinical data and are currently used for treatment of COVID-19.
32372695,However, some of these medications have potential cardiac adverse effects.
32372695,This is important because up to one-third of patients with COVID-19 have cardiac injury, which can further increase the risk of cardiomyopathy and arrhythmias.
32372695,Adverse effects of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine on cardiac function and conduction are broad and can be fatal.
32372695,Both drugs have an anti-arrhythmic property and are proarrhythmic.
32372695,The American Heart Association has listed chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine as agents which can cause direct myocardial toxicity.
32372695,Similarly, other investigational drugs such as favipiravir and lopinavir/ritonavir can prolong QT interval and cause Torsade de Pointes.
32372695,Many antibiotics commonly used for the treatment of patients with COVID-19, for instance azithromycin, can also prolong QT interval.
32372695,This review summarizes evidenced-based data regarding potential cardiac adverse effects due to off-label and investigational drugs including chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, antiviral therapy, monoclonal antibodies, as well as common antibiotics used for the treatment of COVID-19.
32372695,The article focuses on practical points and offers a point-of-care protocol for providers who are taking care of patients with COVID-19 in an inpatient and outpatient setting.
32372695,The proposed protocol is taking into consideration that resources during the pandemic are limited.
32372796,Thousands of people are searching for coronavirus treatments.
32372796,Which are most promising and when will we have them, asks <b>Carrie Arnold</b>.
32372821,The covid-19 pandemic has encouraged more people to make advance treatment decisions relating to CPR and ventilation, reports <b>Clare Wilson</b>.
32373183,Chloroquine and closely related structural analogs, employed initially for the treatment of malaria, are now gaining worldwide attention due to the rapidly spreading pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2, named coronavirus disease (COVID) of 2019 (COVID-19).
32373183,Although much of this attention has a mechanistic basis, the hard efficacy data for chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine in the management of the clinical syndrome of COVID-19 have been limited thus far.
32373183,This review aims to present the available <i>in vitro</i> and clinical data for the role of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 and attempts to put them into perspective, especially in relation to the different risks/benefits particular to each patient who may require treatment.
32373461,This Opinion Paper wishes to provide a summary of recent findings and solutions for a better understanding of the environmental and health problems associated with COVID-19.
32373461,The list of topics covered is large: meteorology and air quality factors with correlation number of infections, sewage waters as a way to reveal the scale of COVID-19 outbreak, current hospital disinfection procedures and new eco-friendly technologies and list of drug therapies recommend waiting for the desired vaccine to come.
32373461,During the last two months we did notice an increase in the scientific literature regarding COVID-19 with a partial vision of this problem.
32373461,The current Opinion Paper is one of the first attempts, to my understanding, to summarize and integrate environmental and human health aspects related to the monitoring, fate and treatment solutions for COVID-19.
32373461,That being said I believe that this Opinion Paper can serve as multipurpose document, not only for scientists of different disciplines but for social media and citizens in general.
32373721,The COVID-19 pandemia is affecting people worldwide.
32373721,Most of the patients suffered of a respiratory disease that will progress to an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
32373721,SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia severely ill patients, develop a systemic inflammatory response with a Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), that is characterized by a sudden increase in several pro-inflammatory cytokines, mainly IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-alfa by activated macrophages (M1 phenotype).
32373721,Blocking IL-6 with tocilizumab and using respirator equipment seems to be a very important issue in this (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia, but not all patients are referred to such treatments.
32373721,Low dose radiotherapy (0,5 Gy), is an evidence-based anti-inflammatory treatment, that could modify the immune landscape in the lung affected of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, through macrophages polarization to alternatively activated Macrophages (M2 phenotype).
32373721,Radiation-induced cancer risk could be assumed due to the very low dose used, the advanced age of the patients and the life-threatening condition of SARS-Cov2 pneumonia.
32373721,LDRT is a cost-effective non-toxic treatment already available in most general hospitals.
32373721,This fact allows that it would be used for the large number of patients that will suffer this disease, and that would not receive specific anti-IL-6 treatments in ICUs in low and middle income countries.
32373992,At present, SARS-Cov-2 is spread all over the world, becoming a serious threat to people's health.
32373992,SARS-Cov-2 has a strong infection, and the mortality rate of severe patients after infection is high, but there is no effective treatment.
32373992,Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory functions, which can reduce the occurrence of cytokine storm syndrome and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
32373992,At the same time, MSCs can reduce the level of pulmonary fibrosis and enhance tissue injury repair.
32373992,In this short report, combined with the progress of preclinical and clinical research, we comment the efficacy of MSCs in the treatment of COVID-19.
32373993,The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), also called COVID-19, has caused a pandemic which has swiftly involved the entire world and raised great public health concerns.
32373993,The scientific community is actively exploring treatments that would potentially be effective in combating COVID-19.
32373993,Hydroxychloroquine has been demonstrated to limit the replication of SARS-CoV-2 virus in vitro.
32373993,In malarial pandemic countries, chloroquine is widely used to treat malaria.
32373993,In malarial non-pandemic nations, chloroquine is not widely used.
32373993,Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine share similar chemical structures and mechanisms of action.
32373993,The aim of this study was to indirectly investigate the efficacy of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19 by determining the prevalence of COVID-19 in malaria pandemic and non-pandemic nations.
32373993,We sought evidence to support or refute the hypothesis that these drugs could show efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19.
32373993,We reviewed in vitro studies, in vivo studies, original studies, clinical trials, and consensus reports, that were conducted to evaluate the antiviral activities of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine.
32373993,The studies on &quot;COVID-19 and its allied treatment were found from World Health Organization (WHO), ISI-Web of Science, PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Google Scholar, and clinical trial registries.
32373993,The search was based on keywords: antiviral drugs, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, COVID-19, COVID-19 treatment modalities, and coronavirus.
32373993,In addition, we analyzed the prevalence of COVID-19 in malaria pandemic and non-pandemic countries.
32373993,The review and analyses were performed on March 28, 2020.
32373993,For this study, we identified a total of 09 published articles: 03 clinical trials with sample size 150; 03 in vitro studies and 03 expert consensus reports.
32373993,These studies were all suggestive that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine can successfully treat COVID-19 infections.
32373993,We found that COVID-19 infections are highly pandemic in countries where malaria is least pandemic and are least pandemic in nations where malaria is highly pandemic.
32373993,Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have antiviral characteristics in vitro.
32373993,The findings support the hypothesis that these drugs have efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19.
32373993,People are currently using these drugs for malaria.
32373993,It is reasonable, given the hypothetical benefit of these two drugs, that they are now being tested in clinical trials to assess their effectiveness to combat this global health crisis.
32373997,The recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 greatly involves the resources of the global healthcare system, as it affects newborns, adults, and elders.
32373997,This infection runs in three major stages: a mild cold-like illness, a moderate respiratory syndrome and a severe acute interstitial pneumonia.
32373997,SARS-CoV-2 infection seems to have a more benign evolution in children.
32373997,As a matter of fact, low susceptibility and minor aggressivity have been highlighted in most cases.
32373997,There are currently no effective antiviral drugs treatment for the affected children.
32373997,No sufficient results have been reached by the use of interferon (IFN), lopinavir/ritonavir, orbidol, and oseltamivir in the treatment of the coronaviruses infection.
32373997,The aim of this short review is to highlight the differences existing between COVID-19 cases in adults and children.
32373998,Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has rapidly spread all over the world, in just two months.
32373998,As of 27 March, globally, 509,164 cases confirmed included 23,335 deaths in approximately 150 countries.
32373998,Recently, WHO has defined COVID-19 as a global pandemic, and considerable researches have focused on the identification and prevention of SARS-CoV-2.
32373998,As a result, accumulated publications successively reported their early findings, leading to the constant updating of information, which might make confusion for readers.
32373998,Therefore, this review summarized the current researches about the genomic evolution, variation of SARS-CoV-2, and demonstrated its viral structure for pathogenesis.
32373998,Meanwhile, we analyzed the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of COVID-19, in order to provide recommendations for present clinical treatments and inspirations for potential therapy options.
32373999,In December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was reported in Wuhan, China, and it subsequently spread in many countries around the world.
32373999,Many efforts have been applied to control and prevent the spread of COVID-19, and many scientific studies have been conducted in a short period of time.
32373999,Here we present an overview of the viral structure, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and clinical features of COVID-19 based on the current state of knowledge, and we compare its clinical characteristics with SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).
32373999,Current researches on potentially effective treatment alternatives are discussed.
32373999,We hope this review can help medical workers and researchers around the world contain the current COVID-19 pandemic.
32374000,The last two decades have witnessed two large-scale pandemics caused by coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).
32374000,At the end of 2019, another novel coronavirus, designated as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), hit Wuhan, a city in the center of China, and subsequently spread rapidly to the whole world.
32374000,Latest reports revealed that more than 800 thousand people in over 200 countries are involved in the epidemic disease by SARS-CoV-2.
32374000,Due to the high mortality rate and the lack of optimum therapeutics, it is crucial to understand the biological characteristics of the virus and its possible pathogenesis to respond to the SARS-CoV-2.
32374000,Rapid diagnostics and effective therapeutics are also important interventions for the management of infection control.
32374000,However, the rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2 exerted tremendous challenges on its diagnostics and therapeutics.
32374000,Therefore, there is an urgent need to summarize the existing research results to guide decision-making on the prioritization of resources for research and development.
32374000,In this review, we focus on our current understanding of epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnostics and therapeutics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32374001,COVID-19 pandemic can cause irreparable damage to the involved society.
32374001,This study aimed to provide a summary of the up-to-dated clinical display, diagnostics, molecular and genetic implications for COVID-19 infected patients.
32374001,In this review, 73 research articles published before 25 March 2020 were analyzed to better understand the clinical characteristics of patients and to introduce the available serological, hematology and molecular diagnostic methods.
32374001,Apart from articles extracted from PubMed and Google Scholar, WHO (https://www.who.int/), NHC (National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, https://www.nice.org.uk/), CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, https://www.cdc.gov/), and National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine (http://www.satcm.gov.cn/) were also accessed to search for eligible studies.
32374001,Papers published between January 1, 2020, and 25 March 2020 were searched in English and the terms &quot;2019-nCoV, Covid-19, Clinical Characteristics OR manifestation, method of detection, COVID-19 Genome and molecular test&quot; were used.
32374001,As the pandemic continues to evolve, there have been reports about the possibility of asymptomatic transmission of this newly emerged pneumonia virus.
32374001,We highlighted the role of HLA haplotype in virus infection as HLA typing will provide susceptibility information for personalized prevention, diagnosis, and treatment in future studies.
32374001,All the data in this article will assist researchers and clinicians to develop their clinical views regarding infected patients and to emphasize the origin of SARS-CoV-2 for diagnostics.
32374007,To summarize the current practice and potential strategy in diagnosing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32374007,PubMed, Web of Science were systematically searched using terms including &quot;COVID-19&quot;, &quot;SARS-CoV-2&quot; and &quot;2019-nCoV&quot;.
32374007,After removing duplicates, we then identified articles, letters and commentaries regarding diagnosing COVID-19.
32374007,Here we summarized relatively mature diagnostic methods like nuclear acid test and computed tomography.
32374007,Besides, new aspects regarding these detection methods like suitable specimens for nuclear acid test, possible use of 18F-FDG PET/CT were also reported.
32374007,Especially, we also presented several novel techniques for diagnosing COVID-19 like lung ultrasound.
32374007,Chinese Clinical Guidance for COVID-19 Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment (7th edition) by National Health Commission is recommended to follow as it provides detailed diagnostic procedures using currently available tools.
32374007,We suggest clinicians further explore the saliva's utility as a specimen for nuclear acid test and the use of lung ultrasound.
32374026,This document aims to provide practical guidance for the assessment and management of patients with thrombocytopenia, with a particular focus on Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP) during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32374026,The intention is to support clinicians and, although recommendations have been provided, it is not a formal guideline.
32374026,Nor is there sufficient evidence base to conclude that alternative approaches to treatment are incorrect.
32374026,Instead, it is a consensus written by clinicians with an interest in ITP or coagulation disorders and reviewed by members of the UK ITP forum.
32374074,A novel coronavirus [severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), or 2019 novel coronavirus] has been identified as the pathogen of coronavirus disease 2019.
32374074,The main protease (M<sup>pro</sup> , also called 3-chymotrypsin-like protease) of SARS-CoV-2 is a potential target for treatment of COVID-19.
32374074,A M<sup>pro</sup> homodimer structure suitable for docking simulations was prepared using a crystal structure (PDB ID: 6Y2G; resolution 2.20 Å).
32374074,Structural refinement was performed in the presence of peptidomimetic α-ketoamide inhibitors, which were previously disconnected from each Cys145 of the M<sup>pro</sup> homodimer, and energy calculations were performed.
32374074,Structure-based virtual screenings were performed using the ChEMBL database.
32374074,Through a total of 1 485 144 screenings, 64 potential drugs (11 approved, 14 clinical, and 39 preclinical drugs) were predicted to show high binding affinity with M<sup>pro</sup> .
32374074,Additional docking simulations for predicted compounds with high binding affinity with M<sup>pro</sup> suggested that 28 bioactive compounds may have potential as effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug candidates.
32374074,The procedure used in this study is a possible strategy for discovering anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs from drug libraries that may significantly shorten the clinical development period with regard to drug repositioning.
32374264,Real-world drug repurposing-the immediate &quot;off-label&quot; prescribing of drugs to address urgent clinical needs-is a widely overlooked opportunity.
32374264,Off-label prescribing (ie, for a nonapproved indication) is legal in most countries and tends to shift the burden of liability and cost to physicians and patients, respectively.
32374264,Nevertheless, health crises may mean that real-world repurposing is the only realistic source for solutions.
32374264,Optimal real-world repurposing requires a track record of safety, affordability, and access for drug candidates.
32374264,Although thousands of such drugs are already available, there is no central repository of off-label uses to facilitate immediate identification and selection of potentially useful interventions during public health crises.
32374264,Using the current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic as an example, we provide a glimpse of the extensive literature that supports the rationale behind six generic drugs, in four classes, all of which are affordable, supported by decades of safety data, and targeted toward the underlying pathophysiology that makes COVID-19 so deadly.
32374264,This paper briefly summarizes why cimetidine or famotidine, dipyridamole, fenofibrate or bezafibrate, and sildenafil citrate are worth considering for patients with COVID-19.
32374264,Clinical trials to assess efficacy are already underway for famotidine, dipyridamole, and sildenafil, and further trials of all these agents will be important in due course.
32374264,These examples also reveal the unlimited opportunity to future-proof our health care systems by proactively mining, synthesizing, cataloging, and evaluating the off-label treatment opportunities of thousands of safe, well-established, and affordable generic drugs.
32374440,COVID-19 continues to impact older adults disproportionately, from severe illness and hospitalization to increased mortality risk.
32374440,Concurrently, concerns about potential shortages of healthcare professionals and health supplies to address these needs have focused attention on how resources are ultimately allocated and used.
32374440,Some strategies misguidedly use age as an arbitrary criterion, which inappropriately disfavors older adults.
32374440,This statement represents the official policy position of the American Geriatrics Society (AGS).
32374440,It is intended to inform stakeholders including hospitals, health systems, and policymakers about ethical considerations to consider when developing strategies for allocating scarce resources during an emergency involving older adults.
32374440,Members of the AGS Ethics Committee collaborated with interprofessional experts in ethics, law, nursing, and medicine (including geriatrics, palliative care, emergency medicine, and pulmonology/critical care) to conduct a structured literature review and examine relevant reports.
32374440,The resulting recommendations defend a particular view of distributive justice that maximizes relevant clinical factors and de-emphasizes or eliminates factors placing arbitrary, disproportionate weight on advanced age.
32374440,The AGS positions include: (1) avoiding age per se as a means for excluding anyone from care; (2) assessing comorbidities and considering the disparate impact of social determinants of health; (3) encouraging decision makers to focus primarily on potential short-term (not long-term) outcomes; (4) avoiding ancillary criteria such as &quot;life-years saved&quot; and &quot;long-term predicted life expectancy&quot; that might disadvantage older people; (5) forming and staffing triage committees tasked with allocating scarce resources; (6) developing institutional resource allocation strategies that are transparent and applied uniformly; and (7) facilitating appropriate advance care planning.
32374440,The statement includes recommendations that should be immediately implemented to address resource allocation strategies during COVID-19, aligning with AGS positions.
32374440,The statement also includes recommendations for post-pandemic review.
32374440,Such review would support revised strategies to ensure that governments and institutions have equitable emergency resource allocation strategies, avoid future discriminatory language and practice, and have appropriate guidance to develop national frameworks for emergent resource allocation decisions.
32374474,Outbreaks of infections with viruses like Sars-CoV-2, Ebola virus and Zika virus lead to major global health and economic problems because of limited treatment options.
32374474,Therefore, new antiviral drug candidates are urgently needed.
32374474,The promising new antiviral drug candidate silvestrol effectively inhibited replication of Corona-, Ebola-, Zika-, Picorna-, Hepatis E and Chikungunya viruses.
32374474,Besides a direct impact on pathogens, modulation of the host immune system provides an additional facet to antiviral drug development because suitable immune modulation can boost innate defence mechanisms against the pathogens.
32374474,In the present study, silvestrol down-regulated several pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, CCL2, CCL18) and increased TNF-α during differentiation and activation of M1-macrophages, suggesting that the effects of silvestrol might cancel each other out.
32374474,However, silvestrol amplified the anti-inflammatory potential of M2-macrophages by increasing expression of anti-inflammatory surface markers CD206, TREM2 and reducing release of pro-inflammatory IL-8 and CCL2.
32374474,The differentiation of dendritic cells in the presence of silvestrol is characterized by down-regulation of several surface markers and cytokines indicating that differentiation is impaired by silvestrol.
32374474,In conclusion, silvestrol influences the inflammatory status of immune cells depending on the cell type and activation status.
32374537,Since its emergence in December 2019, scientific knowledge about the SARS-CoV-2 virus has evolved rapidly but, due to the complexity and novelty of this infection and its political and economic stakes, much remains to be clarified.
32374537,Thousands of studies have already been published and scientific research is constantly evolving.
32374537,In this multitude of information, we offer an update of the knowledge currently available.
32374537,A limitation of the propagation, the understanding of the functioning of the virus and its clinical manifestations, the administration of specific treatments, rapid and reliable diagnostic tools are the basis of the fight against this germ, which is still little known today.
32374537,Depuis son apparition en Décembre 2019, les connaissances scientifiques concernant le virus SARS-CoV-2 ont rapidement évolués mais, en raison de la complexité et nouveauté de cette infection et de ses enjeux politiques et économiques, encore beaucoup reste à clarifier.
32374537,Des milliers d’études ont déjà été publiés et la recherche scientifique est en constante évolution.
32374537,Dans cette multitude d’informations, nous proposons une mise à jour des connaissances actuellement disponibles.
32374537,Une limitation de la propagation, la compréhension du fonctionnement du virus et de ses manifestations cliniques, l’administration de traitements spécifiques et des outils diagnostiques rapides et fiables, sont à la base de la lutte contre ce germe à présent encore méconnu.
32374538,Emergency departments are on the front line in the management of COVID-19 cases, from screening to the initial management of the most severe cases.
32374538,The clinical presentation of COVID-19 range from non-specific symptoms to adult acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
32374538,Diagnosis is based on PCR from a nasopharyngeal swab and emergency treatment rely on oxygen therapy.
32374538,Patient's orientation (home, hospitalization, admission in intensive care unit) is a central aspect of emergency management.
32374538,The shift from a strategy of systematic recognition of potential cases to the one of epidemic mitigation required hospital emergency medicine services to implement crisis management measures, to guarantee admission and hospitalization capacity.
32374538,Les services d’urgences sont en première ligne dans la gestion des cas de COVID-19, qu’il s’agisse du dépistage ou de la prise en charge des cas les plus sévères.
32374538,La clinique associée au COVID-19 va de symptômes non spécifiques au syndrome de détresse respiratoire aiguë de l’adulte.
32374538,Le diagnostic repose sur la PCR à partir d’un frottis nasopharyngé et le traitement d’urgence sur l’oxygénothérapie.
32374538,L’orientation du patient (retour à domicile, hospitalisation, indication aux soins intensifs) est un aspect central de la prise en charge aux urgences.
32374538,Le passage de la stratégie de reconnaissance systématique des cas potentiels à celle de la mitigation de l’épidémie a impliqué pour les services d’urgences hospitaliers la mise en place de mesures exceptionnelles afin de garantir une capacité d’accueil et d’hospitalisation.
32374540,Numerous patients with asthma or COPD are likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus.
32374540,Although data is limited, patients with severe and/or uncontrolled asthma and those with COPD appear to be at increased risk of a more severe course of COVID-19 infection.
32374540,Usual recommendations for management of asthma and COPD remain valid despite the ongoing epidemic.
32374540,However, lung function testing and nebulisers should be performed with caution during the COVID-19 pandemic due to a potential risk of virus aerosolisation and contagion during the procedure.
32374540,Particular care must be taken to identify and protect patients who are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 infection.
32374540,Asthma and COPD treatments should be pursued and adapted to ensure optimal control of the lung disease throughout the epidemic, thus reducing the risk of severe COVID-19 disease.
32374540,De nombreux patients avec asthme ou BPCO sont susceptibles d’être infectés par le virus SARS-CoV-2.
32374540,Bien que les données soient encore limitées, les patients souffrant d’un asthme sévère et/ou non contrôlé et ceux avec une BPCO semblent présenter un risque plus élevé d’infection COVID-19 d’évolution sévère.
32374540,Les recommandations habituelles de prise en charge de l’asthme et de la BPCO restent pour la plupart valables malgré l’épidémie en cours.
32374540,Cependant, les épreuves fonctionnelles respiratoires et les traitements en nébulisation sont à effectuer avec précaution pendant la pandémie de COVID-19 en raison d’un risque potentiel d’aérosolisation du virus pendant la procédure.
32374540,Un soin particulier doit être apporté à l’identification et la protection des patients particulièrement vulnérables à l’infection COVID-19.
32374540,Les traitements de l’asthme et de la BPCO doivent être poursuivis et adaptés dans le but d’assurer un contrôle optimal de la pathologie respiratoire tout au long de l’épidémie et ainsi limiter le risque de maladie COVID-19 grave.
32374541,Based on the epidemiological data currently available, diabetes does not seem to be a risk factor for infection with SARS-CoV-2 but may be associated with a more severe course.
32374541,Diabetes is extremely common in older patients with co-morbidities who are at risk of unfavorable outcomes.
32374541,As with any other infection, poorly controlled pre-existing diabetes can promote secondary infections and lead to acute complications related to hyperglycemia, worsened itself by the infection.
32374541,It is important to advise patients to have enough diabetic equipment and supplies at home, to make regular blood glucose self-tests, and to contact a caregiver immediately in case of glycemic imbalance or signs of infection.
32374541,Antidiabetic therapy may need adjustments following usual sick day rules.
32374541,Insulin therapy should be considered to treat any persistent hyperglycemia in patients hospitalized for an acute infection.
32374541,D’après les données épidémiologiques actuellement disponibles, le diabète ne semble pas être un facteur de risque d’infection par le SARS-CoV-2.
32374541,Il est cependant associé à une maladie plus sévère principalement en raison de sa haute prévalence chez les personnes âgées et polymorbides dont l’évolution est plus souvent défavorable.
32374541,Comme lors de n’importe quelle autre infection, un diabète préexistant, surtout s’il est mal contrôlé, peut favoriser les surinfections et entraîner des complications aiguës liées à l’hyperglycémie, elle-même majorée par l’infection.
32374541,Il est important de recommander aux patients d’avoir suffisamment de matériel à domicile, d’effectuer des automesures régulières de la glycémie, ainsi que de contacter un soignant immédiatement en cas de déséquilibre glycémique ou d’infection.
32374541,Le traitement antidiabétique doit être adapté comme habituellement en cas d’infection.
32374541,Une insulinothérapie doit être envisagée en cas d’hyperglycémie persistante chez tout patient hospitalisé pour une infection aiguë.
32374806,The SARS-CoV-2 virus reached Spain in March 2020, and a nationwide state of alert was declared on March 14th, leading to the confinement of the entire population.
32374806,The current study was conducted in the Basque Autonomous Community in northern Spain.
32374806,The authors analyzed stress, anxiety, and depression with the arrival of the virus and the levels of symptoms according to age, comorbidity, and confinement.
32374806,Levels of anxiety, stress, and depression were measured in a sample of 976 adults, using the DASS scale (Depression Anxiety, and Stress Scale).
32374806,Although levels of symptoms were generally low at the start of the alert, younger individuals with chronic diseases reported more symptoms than the rest of the population.
32374806,The study also detected higher levels of symptoms after the stay-at-home order was issued.
32374806,Such symptoms are predicted to increase as the confinement continues.
32374806,The authors propose psychological interventions for prevention and treatment in order to mitigate the pandemic's psychological impacts.
32374806,En marzo de 2020, el virus SARS-CoV-2 procedente de China ha llegado a España y desde el 14 de marzo se ha declarado el estado de alarma en todo el Estado español, llevando al confinamiento a toda la población.
32374806,La presente investigación se contextualiza en la Comunidad Autónoma Vasca (situada al norte de España).
32374806,Se han analizado los niveles de estrés, ansiedad y depresión a la llegada del virus y se han estudiado los niveles de sintomatología psicológica según edad, cronicidad y confinamiento.
32374806,Se ha recogido una muestra de 976 personas y la medición de las variables ansiedad, estrés y depresión se ha hecho mediante la escala DASS (Escala de Depresión, Ansiedad y Estrés).
32374806,Los resultados demuestran que, aunque los niveles de sintomatología han sido bajos en general al principio de la alarma, la población más joven y con enfermedades crónicas ha referido sintomatología más alta que el resto de población.
32374806,También se ha detectado un mayor nivel de sintomatología a partir del confinamiento, donde las personas tienen prohibido salir de sus casas.
32374806,Se prevé que la sintomatología aumentará según vaya transcurriendo el confinamiento.
32374806,Se defienden intervenciones psicológicas de prevención y tratamiento para bajar el impacto psicológico que pueda crear esta pandemia.
32374806,Em março de 2020, o vírus SARS-CoV-2, procedente da China, chegou à Espanha e desde 14 de março está declarado estado de emergência em todo o país, forçando toda a população ao confinamento.
32374806,O presente estudo foi conduzido no País Basco (norte da Espanha).
32374806,Foram analisados os níveis de estresse, ansiedade e depressão desde a introdução do vírus e os níveis de sintomas psicológicos segundo idade, comorbidades e confinamento.
32374806,A amostra foi composta de 976 indivíduos e a medição das variáveis ansiedade, estresse e depressão foi realizada a partir do intrumento DASS (Escala de Depressão, Ansiedade e Estresse).
32374806,Os resultados mostram que, ainda que os níveis de sintomas tenham sido baixos no início do confinamento, os indivíduos mais jovens e com comorbidades referiram mais sintomas que o restante da população.
32374806,Também se detectou maior nível de sintomas desde o confinamento, quando a população foi proibida de sair de suas casas.
32374806,Se prevê aumento dos sintomas conforme o confimaneto continuar.
32374806,Intervenções psicológicas de prevenção e tratamento são necessárias para diminuir o impacto psicológico causado pela pandemia.
32374823,The outbreak of COVID-2019 initiated at Wuhan, China has become a global threat by rapid transmission and severe fatalities.
32374823,Recent studies have uncovered whole genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 (causing COVID-2019).
32374823,In addition, lung metagenomic studies on infected patients revealed overrepresented Prevotella spp. producing certain proteins in abundance.
32374823,We performed host-pathogen protein-protein interaction analysis between SARS-CoV-2 and overrepresented Prevotella proteins with human proteome.
32374823,We also performed functional overrepresentation analysis of interacting proteins to understand their role in COVID-2019 severity.
32374823,It was found that over-expressed Prevotella proteins can promote viral infection.
32374823,As per the results, Prevotella proteins, but not viral proteins are involved in multiple interactions with NF-kB, which is involved in increasing clinical severity of COVID-2019.
32374823,Prevotella may have role in COVID-2019 outbreak and should be given importance for understanding disease mechanisms and improving treatment outcomes.
32374823,Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
32375011,The COVID-19 outbreak has led to wide-scale self-isolation, as a result of the quarantine period recommended by the World Health Organization.
32375011,Consequently, people's mental health, including their anxiety levels, may be becoming impaired.
32375011,To cope with the situation, the exergame appears to be an enjoyable easy-to-use tool for reducing social isolation, as well as an interesting mode of home-based exercise for tackling anxiety disorders and sedentary behavior.
32375011,This article critically appraises the opportunities and challenges exergames present for the prevention and treatment of anxiety disorders in a home-based environment during the COVID-19 quarantine period.
32375025,Coronaviruses make use of a large envelope protein called spike (S) to engage host cell receptors and catalyze membrane fusion.
32375025,Because of the vital role that these S proteins play, they represent a vulnerable target for the development of therapeutics.
32375025,Here, we describe the isolation of single-domain antibodies (VHHs) from a llama immunized with prefusion-stabilized coronavirus spikes.
32375025,These VHHs neutralize MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV-1 S pseudotyped viruses, respectively.
32375025,Crystal structures of these VHHs bound to their respective viral targets reveal two distinct epitopes, but both VHHs interfere with receptor binding.
32375025,We also show cross-reactivity between the SARS-CoV-1 S-directed VHH and SARS-CoV-2 S and demonstrate that this cross-reactive VHH neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 S pseudotyped viruses as a bivalent human IgG Fc-fusion.
32375025,These data provide a molecular basis for the neutralization of pathogenic betacoronaviruses by VHHs and suggest that these molecules may serve as useful therapeutics during coronavirus outbreaks.
32375085,The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a major health crisis, with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) having infected over a million people around the world within a few months of its identification as a human pathogen.
32375085,Initially, SARS-CoV-2 infects cells in the respiratory system and causes inflammation and cell death.
32375085,Subsequently, the virus spreads out and damages other vital organs and tissues, triggering a complicated spectrum of pathophysiological changes and symptoms, including cardiovascular complications.
32375085,Acting as the receptor for SARS-CoV entering mammalian cells, angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) plays a pivotal role in the regulation of cardiovascular cell function.
32375085,Diverse clinical manifestations and laboratory abnormalities occur in patients with cardiovascular injury in COVID-19, characterizing the development of this complication, as well as providing clues to diagnosis and treatment.
32375085,This review provides a summary of the rapidly appearing laboratory and clinical evidence for the pathophysiology and therapeutic approaches to COVID-19 pulmonary and cardiovascular complications.
32375144,The COVID-19 pandemic has stressed patients and healthcare givers alike and challenged our practice of antenatal care, including fetal diagnosis and therapy.
32375144,This document aims to review relevant recent information to allow us to optimize prenatal care delivery.
32375144,We discuss potential modifications to obstetric management and fetal procedures in SARS-CoV2-negative and SARS-CoV2-positive patients with fetal anomalies or disorders.
32375144,Most fetal therapies are time sensitive and cannot be delayed.
32375144,If personnel and resources are available, we should continue to offer procedures of proven benefit, acknowledging any fetal and maternal risks, including those to health care workers.
32375144,There is, to date, minimal, unconfirmed evidence of spontaneous vertical transmission, though it may theoretically be increased with some procedures.
32375144,Knowing a mother's preoperative SARS-CoV-2 status would enable us to avoid or defer certain procedures while she is contagious and to protect health care workers appropriately.
32375144,Some fetal conditions may alternatively be managed neonatally.
32375144,Counseling regarding fetal interventions which have a possibility of additional intra- or postoperative morbidity must be performed in the context of local resource availability.
32375144,Procedures of unproven benefit should not be offered.
32375144,We encourage participation in registries and trials that may help us to understand the impact of COVID-19 on pregnant women, their fetuses, and neonates.
32375200,The number of patients requiring tracheal intubation rose dramatically in March and April 2020 with the COVID-19 outbreak.
32375200,Our thoracic surgery department has seen an increased incidence of severe pneumomediastinum referred for surgical opinion in intubated patients with COVID-19 pneumonitis.
32375200,Here we present a series of five cases of severe pneumomediastinum requiring decompression therapy over a 7-day period in the current COVID-19 outbreak.
32375200,We hypothesise that the mechanism for this is the aggressive disease pathophysiology with an increased risk of alveolar damage and tracheobronchial injury along with the use of larger bore tracheal tubes and higher ventilation pressures.
32375200,We present this case series in order to highlight the increased risk of this potentially life-threatening complication among the COVID-19 patient cohort and offer guidance for its management to critical care physicians.
32375268,The current coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic, which originated in Wuhan, China, has raised significant social, psychological and economic concerns in addition to direct medical issues.
32375268,The rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 to almost every country on the globe and the failure to contain the infections have contributed to fear and panic worldwide.
32375268,The lack of available and efficient antiviral drugs or vaccines has further worsened the situation.
32375268,For these reasons, it cannot be overstated that an accelerated effort for the development of novel drugs and vaccines is needed.
32375268,In this context, novel approaches in both gene therapy and vaccine development are essential.
32375268,Previous experience from SARS- and MERS-coronavirus vaccine and drug development projects have targeted glycoprotein epitopes, monoclonal antibodies, angiotensin receptor blockers and gene silencing technologies, which may be useful for COVID-19 too.
32375268,Moreover, existing antivirals used for other types of viral infections have been considered as urgent action is necessary.
32375268,This review aims at providing a background of coronavirus genetics and biology, examples of therapeutic and vaccine strategies taken and potential innovative novel approaches in progress.
32375446,In order to achieve the overall victory over 2019 novel coronavirus disease epidemic, especially to prevent the disease recurrence from rebounding during the resumption of labor, the government has not loosened any control of personnel mobility, which has obviously affected the normal examination and treatment of lung cancer patients under the influence of this epidemic.
32375446,During the epidemic period, cancer patients with low immunity levels face the double ordeals of disease and epidemic situation.
32375446,Compared with the general population, they are more likely to be infected with the new coronavirus.
32375446,Among the infected cancer patients, lung cancer is the most common type.
32375446,It is necessary to provide more appropriate individualized treatment recommendations for patients with lung cancer based on the epidemic situation of the patient's location and in combination with the patient's own condition.
32375446,Through active prevention of infection, timely conversion of treatment strategies, online and offline joint control, and positive psychological counseling, we do our best to help patients with lung cancer to survive this difficult period.
32375446,为取得新型冠状病毒肺炎(COVID－19)战&quot;疫&quot;的全面胜利，特别是防止复工复产阶段的疫情反弹，社会各界对人员流动的管控仍无丝毫放松，肺癌患者的正常诊治在COVID－19疫情的影响下受到了巨大考验。
32375446,在疫情期间，免疫力水平低下的恶性肿瘤患者面临着疾病与疫情的双重考验，相比普通人群，其更容易感染2019新型冠状病毒。
32375446,在被感染的恶性肿瘤患者中，肺癌是最常见的类型。
32375446,在疫情期间，需根据患者所在地的疫情现状，结合患者的自身情况，为肺癌患者提供更合适的个体化治疗建议，通过积极预防感染、及时转换治疗策略、线上线下联合管控、积极的心理疏导等措施最大程度地帮助肺癌患者顺利度过这段艰难的时期。.
32375487,Hospitals play a critical role in providing communities with essential medical care during all types of disaster.
32375487,Depending on their scope and nature, disasters can lead to a rapidly increasing service demand that can overwhelm the functional capacity and safety of hospitals and the healthcare system at large.
32375487,Planning during the community outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is critical for maintaining healthcare services during our response.
32375487,This paper describes, besides general measures in times of a pandemic, also the necessary changes in the invasive diagnosis and treatment of patients presenting with different entities of acute coronary syndromes including structural adaptations (networks, spokes and hub centres) and therapeutic adjustments.
32375488,The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic is to date affecting more than a million of patients and is challenging healthcare professionals around the world.
32375488,Coronavirus disease 2019 may present with a wide range of clinical spectrum and severity, including severe interstitial pneumonia with high prevalence of hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intensive care admission.
32375488,There has been increasing sharing experience regarding the patient's clinical features over the last weeks which has underlined the need for general guidance on treatment strategies.
32375488,We summarise the evidence existing in the literature of oxygen and positive pressure treatments in patients at different stages of respiratory failure and over the course of the disease, including environment and ethical issues related to the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 infection.
32375564,To reduce the spread of COVID-19, the World Health Organization and the majority of governments have recommended that the entire human population should 'stay-at-home'.
32375564,A significant proportion of the population live alone or are vulnerable to mental health problems yet, in the vast majority of cases, individuals in social isolation have no access to mental healthcare.
32375564,The only resource is people themselves using self-help, self-medication and self-care.
32375564,During prolonged COVID-19 isolation, an in-built system of homeostasis can help rebalance activity, thought and feeling.
32375564,Increased physical activity enables a reset of physical and mental well-being.
32375564,During periods of lockdown, it is recommended that exercise should be as vigorously promoted as social distancing itself.
32375574,The reemergence of coronavirus prompts the need for the development of effective therapeutics to prevent the cellular entry and replication of coronavirus.
32375574,This study demonstrated the putative inhibitory potential of lopinavir, remdesivir, oseltamir, azithromycin, ribavirin, and chloroquine towards V-ATPase, protein kinase A, SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein/ACE-2 complex and viral proteases.
32375574,The pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties were predicted through the pkCSM server while the corresponding binding affinity of the selected drugs towards the proteins was computed using AutodockVina Screening tool.
32375574,The ADMET properties revealed all the drugs possess drug-like properties.
32375574,Lopinavir has the highest binding affinities to the pocket site of SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein/ACE-2 complex, cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A and 3-Chymotrypsin like protease while redemsivir has the highest binding affinities for vacuolar proton-translocating ATPase (V-ATPase) and papain-like proteins.
32375574,The amino acids Asp269, Leu370, His374, and His345 were predicted as the key residues for lopinavir binding to human SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein/ACE-2 complex while His378, Tyr515, Leu73, Leu100, Phe32 and Phe40 for remdesivir and Tyr510, Phe504, Met62, Tyr50, and His378 were predicted for azithromycin as the key residues for binding to SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein/ACE-2 complex.
32375574,Moreover, it was also observed that chloroquine has appreciable binding affinities for 3-Chymotrpsin- like protease and cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A when compared to Oseltamivir and ribavirin.
32375574,The study provided evidence suggesting putative repurposing of the selected drugs for the development of valuable drugs for the prevention of cellular entry and replication of coronavirus.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

32375845,In December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was identified in Wuhan, China.
32375845,The World Health Organization (WHO) declared this outbreak a significant threat to international health.
32375845,COVID-19 is highly infectious and can lead to fatal comorbidities especially acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
32375845,Thus, fully understanding the characteristics of COVID-19-related ARDS is conducive to early identification and precise treatment.
32375845,We aimed to describe the characteristics of COVID-19-related ARDS and to elucidate the differences from ARDS caused by other factors.
32375845,COVID-19 mainly affected the respiratory system with minor damage to other organs.
32375845,Injury to the alveolar epithelial cells was the main cause of COVID-19-related ARDS, and endothelial cells were less damaged with therefore less exudation.
32375845,The clinical manifestations were relatively mild in some COVID-19 patients, which was inconsistent with the severity of laboratory and imaging findings.
32375845,The onset time of COVID-19-related ARDS was 8-12 days, which was inconsistent with ARDS Berlin criteria, which defined a 1-week onset limit.
32375845,Some of these patients might have a relatively normal lung compliance.
32375845,The severity was redefined into three stages according to its specificity: mild, mild-moderate, and moderate-severe.
32375845,HFNO can be safe in COVID-19-related ARDS patients, even in some moderate-severe patients.
32375845,The more likely cause of death is severe respiratory failure.
32375845,Thus, the timing of invasive mechanical ventilation is very important.
32375845,The effects of corticosteroids in COVID-19-related ARDS patients were uncertain.
32375845,We hope to help improve the prognosis of severe cases and reduce the mortality.
32375887,The impact of COVID-19 across health services, including treatment services for people who use drugs, is emerging but likely to have a high impact.
32375887,Treatment services for people who use drugs provide essential treatment services including opiate agonist treatment and needle syringe programmes alongside other important treatment programmes across all substance types including withdrawal and counselling services.
32375887,Drug and alcohol hospital consultation-liaison clinicians support emergency departments and other services provided in hospital settings in efficiently managing patients who use drugs and present with other health problems.COVID-19 will impact on staff availability for work due to illness.
32375887,Patients may require home isolation and quarantine periods.
32375887,Ensuring ongoing supply of opiate treatment during these periods will require significant changes to how treatment is provided.
32375887,The use of monthly depot buprenorphine as well as moving from a framework of supervised dosing will be required for patients on sublingual buprenorphine and methadone.
32375887,Ensuring ready access to take-home naloxone for patients is crucial to reduce overdose risks.
32375887,Delivery of methadone and buprenorphine to the homes of people with confirmed COVID-19 infections is likely to need to occur to support home isolation.People who use drugs are likely to be more vulnerable during the COVID-19 epidemic, due to poorer health literacy and stigma and discrimination towards this group.
32375887,People who use drugs may prioritise drug use above other health concerns.
32375887,Adequate supply of clean injecting equipment is important to prevent outbreaks of blood-borne viruses.
32375887,Opiate users may misinterpret SARS-CoV2 symptoms as opiate withdrawal and manage this by using opioids.
32375887,Ensuring people who use drugs have access to drug treatment as well as access to screening and testing for SARS-CoV2 where this is indicated is important.
32376004,The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic (SARS-CoV-2; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) has dramatic consequences on populations in terms of morbidity and mortality and in social terms, the general confinement of almost half of the world's population being a situation unprecedented in history, which is difficult today to measure the impact at the individual and collective levels.
32376004,More specifically, it affects people with various risk factors, which are more frequent in patients suffering from psychiatric disorders.
32376004,Psychiatrists need to know: (i) how to identify, the risks associated with the prescription of psychotropic drugs and which can prove to be counterproductive in their association with COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), (ii) how to assess in terms of benefit/risk ratio, the implication of any hasty and brutal modification on psychotropic drugs that can induce confusion for a differential diagnosis with the evolution of COVID-19.
32376004,We carried out a review of the literature aimed at assessing the specific benefit/risk ratio of psychotropic treatments in patients suffering from COVID-19.
32376004,Clinically, symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 (fever, cough, dyspnea, digestive signs) can be caused by various psychotropic drugs and require vigilance to avoid false negatives and false positives.
32376004,In infected patients, psychotropic drugs should be used with caution, especially in the elderly, considering the pulmonary risk.
32376004,Lithium and Clozapine, which are the reference drugs in bipolar disorder and resistant schizophrenia, warrant specific attention.
32376004,For these two treatments the possibility of a reduction in the dosage - in case of minimal infectious signs and in a situation, which does not allow rapid control - should ideally be considered taking into account the clinical response (even biological; plasma concentrations) observed in the face of previous dose reductions.
32376004,Tobacco is well identified for its effects as an inducer of CYP1A2 enzyme.
32376004,In a COVID+ patient, the consequences of an abrupt cessation of smoking, particularly related with the appearance of respiratory symptoms (cough, dyspnea), must therefore be anticipated for patients receiving psychotropics metabolized by CYP1A2.
32376004,Plasma concentrations of these drugs are expected to decrease and can be related to an increase risk of relapse.
32376004,The symptomatic treatments used in COVID-19 have frequent interactions with the most used psychotropics.
32376004,If there is no curative treatment for infection to SARS-CoV-2, the interactions of the various molecules currently tested with several classes of psychotropic drugs (antidepressants, antipsychotics) are important to consider because of the risk of changes in cardiac conduction.
32376004,Specific knowledge on COVID-19 remains poor today, but we must recommend rigor in this context in the use of psychotropic drugs, to avoid adding, in patients suffering from psychiatric disorders, potentially vulnerable in the epidemic context, an iatrogenic risk or loss of efficiency.
32376099,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, is being defined as the worst pandemic disease of modern times.
32376099,Several professional health organizations have published position papers stating that there is no evidence to change the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in the management of elevated blood pressure in the context of avoiding or treating COVID-19 infection.
32376099,In this article, we review the evidence on the relationship between the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and COVID-19 infection.
32376099,In agreement with current guidelines, patients with hypertension should continue taking antihypertensive medications as prescribed without interruption.
32376099,Because ACEIs and ARBs are also used to retard the progression of chronic kidney disease, we suggest that these recommendations also apply to the use of these agents in chronic kidney disease.
32376099,No differences generally exist between ARBs and ACEIs in terms of efficacy in decreasing blood pressure and improving other outcomes, such as all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, and end-stage renal disease.
32376099,The ACEIs are associated with cough secondary to accumulation of bradykinin and angioedema, and withdrawal rates due to adverse events are lower with ARBs.
32376099,Given their equal efficacy but fewer adverse events, ARBs could potentially be a more favorable treatment option in patients with COVID-19 at higher risk for severe forms of disease.
32376170,The COVID pandemic of 2020 has emerged as a global threat to patients, health care providers, and to the global economy.
32376170,Owing to this particular novel and highly infectious strain of coronavirus, the rapid community spread and clinical severity of the subsequent respiratory syndrome created a substantial strain on hospitals and health care systems around the world.
32376170,The rapid surge of patients presenting over a small period for emergent clinical care, admission to the hospital, and intensive care units with many requiring mechanically assisted ventilators for respiratory support demonstrated the potential to overwhelm health care workers, hospitals, and health care systems.
32376170,The purpose of this article is to describe an effective system for redeployment of health care supplies, resources, and personnel to hospitals within a suburban academic hospital system to optimize the care of COVID patients, while treating orthopedic patients in an equally ideal setting to maximize their surgical and clinical care.
32376170,This article will provide a particular focus on the current and future role of a specialty hip and knee hospital and its partnering ambulatory surgery center in the context of an outpatient arthroplasty program.
32376263,After COVID-19 crisis in Italy, serious restrictions have been introduced for relatives, with limitations or prohibitions on hospital visits.
32376263,To partially overcome these issues &quot;WhatsApp&quot; has been adopted to get family members to participate in clinical rounds.
32376263,Family members of patients admitted to the acute palliative care unit and hospice were screened for a period of two weeks.
32376263,Four formal questions were posed: 1) Are you happy to virtually attend the clinical round?
32376263,2) Are you happy with the information gained in this occasion?
32376263,3) Do you think that your loved one was happy to see you during the clinical rounds?
32376263,4) This technology may substitute your presence during the clinical rounds?
32376263,The scores were 0 = no, 1 = a little bit, 2 = much, 3 = very much.
32376263,Relatives were free to comment about these points.
32376263,Sixteen of 25 screened family members were interviewed.
32376263,Most family members had a good impression, providing scores of 2 or 3 for the first three items.
32376263,However, the real presence bedside (forth question) was considered irreplaceable.
32376263,They perceived that their loved one, when admitted to hospice, had to say good-bye before dying.
32376346,Owing to the COVID-19 outbreak in Lombardy, Italy) there is an urgent need to manage cardiovascular emergencies, including acute coronary syndrome (ACS), with appropriate standards of care and dedicated preventive measures and pathways against the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32376346,For this reason, the Government of Lombardy decided to centralize the treatment of ACS patients in a limited number of centers, including our university cardiology institute, which in the past 4 weeks became a cardiovascular emergency referral center in a regional hub-and-spoke system.
32376346,Therefore, we rapidly developed a customized pathway to allocate patients to the appropriate hospital ward, and treat them according to ACS severity and risk of suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32376346,We present here the protocol dedicated to ACS patients adopted in our center since March 13, 2020, and our initial experience in the management of ACS patients during the first 4 weeks of its use.
32376346,Certainly, the protocol has room for further improvement as everyone's experience grows, but we hope that it could be a starting point, adaptable to different realities and local resources.
32376394,Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome related to Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) may cause severe illness in 20% of patients.
32376394,This may be in part due to an uncontrolled immune-response to SARS-CoV-2 infection triggering a systemic hyperinflammatory response, the so-called &quot;cytokine storm&quot;.
32376394,The reduction of this inflammatory immune-response could be considered as a potential therapeutic target against severe COVID-19.
32376394,The relationship between inflammation and clot activation must also be considered.
32376394,Furthermore, we must keep in mind that currently, no specific antiviral treatment is available for SARS-CoV-2.
32376394,While moderate-severe forms need in-hospital surveillance plus antivirals and/or hydroxychloroquine; in severe and life-threating subsets a high intensity anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory therapy could be a therapeutic option.
32376394,However, right data on the effectiveness of different immunomodulating drugs are scarce.
32376394,Herein, we discuss the pathogenesis and the possible role played by drugs such as: antimalarials, anti-IL6, anti-IL-1, calcineurin and JAK inhibitors, corticosteroids, immunoglobulins, heparins, angiotensin-converting enzyme agonists and statins in severe COVID-19.
32376395,This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of clinically overt SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) among patients with systemic autoimmune diseases residing in Tuscany, and to compare it with that observed in the general Tuscan population.
32376395,In this cross-sectional study, Tuscan outpatients with systemic autoimmune diseases followed at a tertiary referral centre were telephonically interviewed between April 1st-14th 2020 to collect demographic and clinical data, information on ongoing immunomodulating/immunosuppressive treatments, and on the presence of symptoms suspected of SARS-CoV-2 or of a confirmed infection. 458 patients were interviewed [74% female, median age 56 years (IQR 43-68)]; 56% of them were receiving corticosteroids, 44% traditional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), of whom 23% hydroxychloroquine, 5% colchicine, while 41% were on biologic DMARDs (of whom 9% on tocilizumab).
32376395,Thirteen patients reported symptoms suggesting SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32376395,Of them, 7 had undergone nasopharyngeal swab and only one was positive and developed severe SARS-CoV-2 complications.
32376395,Within our cohort, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was therefore 0.22% (0.01-1.21%), comparable to that observed in the general population of Tuscany [0.20% (0.20-0.21%), p = .597].
32376395,Patients with systemic autoimmune diseases do not seem to carry an increased risk of SARS- CoV-2 infection as compared to the general population.
32376397,Now COVID-19 is causing a severe public health emergency and the mortality is rapidly increasing all over the world.
32376397,In the current pandemic era, although there have been many efforts to diagnose a number of patients with symptoms or close contacts, there is no definite guideline for the initial therapeutic approach for them and therefore, many patients have been dying due to a hyperinflammatory immunological reaction labeled as &quot;cytokine storm&quot;.
32376397,Severe patients are hospitalized and the treatment is done, though they have not been established yet.
32376397,Currently, however, no treatment is provided for those who are isolated at home or shelter until they get severe symptoms, which will increase the harms to the patients.
32376397,In this review, we discuss some important points dedicated to the management of patients with COVID-19, which should help reducing morbidity and mortality.
32376397,In this era, we suggest 7 recommendations to rescue the patients and to reduce the morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19 based on the immunological point of view.
32376402,The emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease (COVID-19) has posed a serious threat to global health.
32376402,As no specific therapeutics are yet available to control disease evolution, more in-depth understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms induced by SARS-CoV-2 will help to characterize new targets for the management of COVID-19.
32376402,The present study identified a specific set of biological pathways altered in primary human lung epithelium upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, and a comparison with SARS-CoV from the 2003 pandemic was studied.
32376402,The transcriptomic profiles were also exploited as possible novel therapeutic targets, and anti-signature perturbation analysis predicted potential drugs to control disease progression.
32376402,Among them, Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK), serine-threonine kinase (AKT), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and I kappa B Kinase (IKK) inhibitors emerged as candidate drugs.
32376402,Finally, sex-specific differences that may underlie the higher COVID-19 mortality in men are proposed.
32376531,In the ongoing fight against the epidemic of COVID-19, the medical staff has been under tremendous pressure.
32376531,Wearing the protective equipment (masks, goggles, and protective screens) with a poor breathability for a long time causes various skin problems, such as allergies, excessive skin hydration, local mechanical injuries, and even secondary infections.
32376531,In addition, in a closed environment, compression and friction aggravate skin reactions, which may compromise duty performance of the medical staff.
32376531,It is therefore essential to provide timely treatment opinions and prevention methods for common skin problems.
32376531,We also give suggestions concerning the preparation of medical kit for skin protection in the epidemic area.
32376532,The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic starting in Wuhan in December, 2019 has spread rapidly throughout the nation.
32376532,The control measures to contain the epidemic also produced influences on the transport and treatment process of patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and adjustments in the management of the patients need to be made at this particular time.
32376532,AMI is characterized by an acute onset with potentially fatal consequence, a short optimal treatment window, and frequent complications including respiratory infections and respiratory and circulatory failure, for which active on-site treatment is essential.
32376532,To standardize the management and facilitate the diagnosis and treatment, we formulated the guidelines for the procedures and strategies for the diagnosis and treatment of AMI, which highlight 5 Key Principles, namely Nearby treatment, Safety protection, Priority of thrombolysis, Transport to designated hospitals, and Remote consultation.
32376532,For AMI patients, different treatment strategies are selected based on the screening results of SARS-CoV-2, the time window of STEMI onset, and the vital signs of the patients.
32376532,During this special period, the cardiologists, including the interventional physicians, should be fully aware of the indications and contraindications of thrombolysis.
32376532,In the transport and treatment of AMI patients, the physicians should strictly observe the indications for patient transport with appropriate protective measurements of the medical staff.
32376546,The ongoing epidemic of caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 starting in December 2019 poses a serious public health threat globally.
32376546,The virus is highly infectious and transmitted mainly through droplets and contacts, and is associated with a high risk of pneumonia.
32376546,A small number of patients may present with acute respiratory distress syndrome with severe respiratory complications, which can lead even to death.
32376546,The selection of appropriate detection techniques and methods for accurate and rapid identification of pathogens therefore plays a key role in improving the diagnosis and treatment of the patients and containing the outbreak.
32376546,In this review, the authors gives an overview of the virus laboratory detection technology, including virus isolation and culture, real-time fluorescent PCR, gene sequencing, serological antibody detection, and the gene editing technology based on CRISPR/Cas13 system.
32376546,These techniques are expected to provide valuable assistance in controlling the epidemic and new ideas for future researches.
32376573,To investigate the correlation between the clinical classification of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the imaging characteristics of multislice spiral computed tomography (MSCT) volume scanning of the lungs.
32376573,The clinical data and thoracic MSCT volume scanning data were analyzed retrospectively for 102 patients with COVID-19 diagnosed and hospitalized in the First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College between January 18 and February 26, 2020.
32376573,According to the Fifth Edition of the Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines by the National Health Commission, the patients were divided into common type, severe type and critical type.
32376573,The imaging characteristics including the lung sides of the lesions, lung segment involved, lesion distribution, and lesion number and density were compared among the patients with different clinical types of COVID-19.
32376573,Seventy-seven of the patients had common type, 18 had severe type and 7 had critical type of COVID-19.
32376573,The main clinical manifestations included fever, cough and fatigue.
32376573,Severe and critical types were more frequently seen in elderly patients, who were more prone to show such symptoms as asthenia, breathing difficulty and dyspnea.
32376573,Two patients presented with no obvious abnormality in the first CT examinations; in the remaining 100 patients, 89.0% had bilateral lung lesions, 16.0% had diffuse lesions, involving a mean of 6.56±4.22 lung segments.
32376573,Compared with the patients with the common type, the severe and critical patients had a significantly greater number of lung segments involved (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05), and were also more likely to show diffuse lesions (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05).
32376573,The lesion side, lesion number or lesion density did not differ significantly among the patients with different clinical types of COVID-19 (<i>P</i> &gt; 0.05).
32376573,MSCT volume scanning not only allows early diagnosis of COVID-19 but also provides evidence for evaluating the severity of COVID-19 to assist in the clinical treatment of the patients.
32376583,We review the experience with the diagnosis and treatment of secondary cerebral infarction in an elderly patient with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32376583,COVID-19 has rapid disease progression with a high mortality rate in elderly patients, and physicians should be alert to secondary bacterial infection that may result in coagulation dysfunction and cerebral infarction.
32376583,Early anti-infection therapy, immune regulation and appropriate anticoagulation intervention may help improve the prognosis of the patients.
32376587,In the setting of epidemics of communicable diseases, early initiation of epidemiological and clinical data collection and analysis and conducting relevant researches are essential to the success of epidemic containment.
32376587,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), starting initially as an epidemic in China in late 2019 and now becoming a pandemic globally, poses grave challenges to the global health care systems while also provides an opportunity for studying infectious diseases in the perspective of methodology.
32376587,The authors propose the evaluation methods for case reports, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), real-world evidence studies and health economics researches during an epidemic.
32376587,Case reports, which are of important value for health care workers during outbreaks of infectious diseases, should be written in standard format and style and published following a strict peer review process.
32376587,RCTs provides the gold standard for evaluating the effectiveness of a given treatment for the patients from the outbreaks.
32376587,We review the potential challenges faced in conducting RCTs during the outbreaks.
32376587,The real-world data collected from the cases in designated hospitals allow the verification of the safety and effectiveness of the intervention measures.
32376587,The data from health economics research also provide important support for optimizing communicable disease prevention and control strategies.
32376587,Herein we summarize the health economics research methods, study design, and technical points during the outbreaks.
32376587,We recommend that clinical research and health economics research be incorporated into the prevention and control plan and measures be taken to ensure both the standards and feasibility of these studies to improve the response capacity against outbreaks of communicable diseases.
32376588,To suppress the rapid spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hubei province, a medical rescue team consisting of 860 members was sent to E'zhou, one of the hard-hit cities in east Hubei.
32376588,A total of 414 of the team members, whose core members were from Guizhou Medical University and its Affiliated Hospital, took over the full operation of Leishan hospital of E'zhou, a makeshift hospital built for treating COVID-19 patients.
32376588,Under the instructions by the E'zhou Medical Team Front Command, the staff made quick responses to the surging number of patients with COVID-19 and rapidly formulated treatment plans based on the local conditions.
32376588,The medical team efficiently carried out the operations and successfully completed the rescue mission.
32376588,Herein the authors, as members of Guizhou Medical Team supporting COVID-19 containment in E'zhou, analyze and summarize the experiences of Guizhou Medical Team with the organization, implementation and logistic support of medical rescue operations, which may provide reference for future rescue missions in a similar scenario.
32376592,To analyze the clinical characteristics of patients with severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) receiving tracheal intubation.
32376592,We analyzed clinical characteristics of 18 severely or critically ill patients with COVID-19 undergoing tracheal intubation.
32376592,The general demographic and clinical data of the patients including their age, gender, pre- intubation state of consciousness and the ventilation mode were recorded.
32376592,The anesthesiologists performing the tracheal intubation procedure evaluated and recorded the tracheal intubation conditions of the patients.
32376592,The changes in the vital signs of the patients before anesthesia induction and after intubation were recorded.
32376592,The average ages of these patients were 70.39±8.02 years.
32376592,Fifteen patients (83.33%) received non- invasive ventilation before tracheal intubation, and 13 patients (72.22%) were conscious before tracheal intubation.
32376592,After induction of anesthesia, the blood pressure and heart rate of the patients decreased significantly (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05).
32376592,Most of the patients (94.44%) were in excellent or good conditions for tracheal intubation, and the first-attempt success rate of tracheal intubation was 100%.
32376592,Five patients died within 3 weeks following the intubation.
32376592,Tracheotomy was performed in one patient.
32376592,Twelve patients were still on endotracheal mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit, and one of them received ECMO treatment due to poor oxygenation.
32376592,A total of 16 experienced anesthesiologists participated in tracheal intubation, all with third-level protection during the operation, and no medical staff infection has been detected so far.
32376592,For patients with severe and critical COVID-19 and indications of tracheal intubation, we recommend early intubation with invasive respiratory support to improve the treatment efficacy and reduce the mortality.
32376592,Anesthetic agents should be used carefully during tracheal intubation to ensure patients' safety.
32376592,The medical staff should have a high-level protection during the intubation to maximally ensure their safety.
32376603,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in an unprecedented public health crisis.
32376603,There are currently no SARS-CoV-2-specific treatments or vaccines available due to the novelty of the virus.
32376603,Hence, rapid development of effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are urgently needed.
32376603,Here we developed a pilot-scale production of a purified inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus vaccine candidate (PiCoVacc), which induced SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies in mice, rats and non-human primates.
32376603,These antibodies neutralized 10 representative SARS-CoV-2 strains, suggesting a possible broader neutralizing ability against SARS-CoV-2 strains.
32376603,Three immunizations using two different doses (3 μg or 6 μg per dose) provided partial or complete protection in macaques against SARS-CoV-2 challenge, respectively, without observable antibody-dependent enhancement of infection.
32376603,These data support clinical development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines for humans.
32376627,The coronavirus disease COVID-19, caused by emerging SARS-CoV-2, has posed serious threats to global public health, economic and social stabilities, calling for the prompt development of therapeutics and prophylactics.
32376627,In this study, we firstly verified that SARS-CoV-2 uses human ACE2 as a cell receptor and its spike (S) protein mediates high membrane fusion activity.
32376627,Comparing to that of SARS-CoV, the heptad repeat 1 (HR1) sequence in the S2 fusion protein of SARS-CoV-2 possesses markedly increased α-helicity and thermostability, as well as a higher binding affinity with its corresponding heptad repeat 2 (HR2) site.
32376627,Then, we designed a HR2 sequence-based lipopeptide fusion inhibitor, termed IPB02, which showed highly potent activities in inhibiting the SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated cell-cell fusion and pseudovirus transduction.
32376627,IPB02 also inhibited the SARS-CoV pseudovirus efficiently.
32376627,Moreover, the structure and activity relationship (SAR) of IPB02 was characterized with a panel of truncated lipopeptides, revealing the amino acid motifs critical for its binding and antiviral capacities.
32376627,Therefore, the presented results have provided important information for understanding the entry pathway of SARS-CoV-2 and the design of antivirals that target the membrane fusion step.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 presents a serious global public health emergency in urgent need of prophylactic and therapeutic interventions.
32376627,The S protein of coronaviruses mediates viral receptor-binding and membrane fusion thus being considered a critical target for antivirals.
32376627,Herein, we report that the SARS-CoV-2 S protein evolves a high activity to mediate cell-cell fusion, significantly differing from the S protein of the previously emerged SARS-CoV.
32376627,In comparison, the HR1 sequence in the fusion protein of SARS-CoV-2 adopts a much higher helical stability and can interact with the HR2 site to form a six-helical bundle structure more efficiently, underlying the mechanism of the enhanced fusion capacity.
32376627,Also importantly, the design of membrane fusion inhibitors with high potencies against both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV has provided potential arsenals to combat the pandemic and tools to exploit the fusion mechanism.
32376714,The year 2020 has seen a major and sustained outbreak of a novel betacoronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus (CoV)-2) infection that causes fever, severe respiratory illness and pneumonia, a disease called Covid-19.
32376714,At the time of writing, the death toll was greater than 120 000 worldwide with more than 2 million documented infections.
32376714,The genome of the CoV encodes a number of structural proteins that facilitate cellular entry and assembly of virions, of which the spike protein S appears to be critical for cellular entry.
32376714,The spike protein guides the virus to attach to the host cell.
32376714,The spike protein contains a receptor-binding domain (RBD), a fusion domain and a transmembrane domain.
32376714,The RBD of spike protein S binds to Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) to initiate cellular entry.
32376714,The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 shows more than 90% amino acid similarity to the pangolin and bat CoVs and these also use ACE2 as a receptor.
32376714,Binding of the spike protein to ACE2 exposes the cleavage sites to cellular proteases.
32376714,Cleavage of the spike protein by transmembrane protease serine 2 and other cellular proteases initiates fusion and endocytosis.
32376714,The spike protein contains an addition furin cleavage site that may allow it to be 'preactivated' and highly infectious after replication.
32376714,The fundamental role of the spike protein in infectivity suggests that it is an important target for vaccine development, blocking therapy with antibodies and diagnostic antigen-based tests.
32376714,This review briefly outlines the structure and function of the 2019 novel CoV/SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S.
32377176,Pancreatic cancer is a very aggressive disease and survival remains dismal even with treatment.
32377176,Currently, management of patients with pancreatic cancer has been complicated by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
32377176,Medical oncologists face the dilemma of whether to treat or to not treat these patients who are at high-risk of complications and even death from COVID-19.
32377176,No current guidelines are available and our limited experience at this time makes it more difficult to manage these patients.
32377176,Although we have general strategies available from experience in Italy, we need more treatment specific strategies to help mitigate risks of complications and toxicities from chemotherapy in order to protect our patients from COVID-19 as much as possible.
32377375,COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has recently affected over 1,200,000 people and killed more than 60,000.
32377375,The key immune cell subsets change and their states during the course of COVID-19 remain unclear.
32377375,We sought to comprehensively characterize the transcriptional changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells during the recovery stage of COVID-19 by single-cell RNA sequencing technique.
32377375,It was found that T cells decreased remarkably, whereas monocytes increased in patients in the early recovery stage (ERS) of COVID-19.
32377375,There was an increased ratio of classical CD14<sup>++</sup> monocytes with high inflammatory gene expression as well as a greater abundance of CD14<sup>++</sup>IL1β<sup>+</sup> monocytes in the ERS.
32377375,CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells decreased significantly and expressed high levels of inflammatory genes in the ERS.
32377375,Among the B cells, the plasma cells increased remarkably, whereas the naïve B cells decreased.
32377375,Several novel B cell-receptor (BCR) changes were identified, such as IGHV3-23 and IGHV3-7, and isotypes (IGHV3-15, IGHV3-30, and IGKV3-11) previously used for virus vaccine development were confirmed.
32377375,The strongest pairing frequencies, IGHV3-23-IGHJ4, indicated a monoclonal state associated with SARS-CoV-2 specificity, which had not been reported yet.
32377375,Furthermore, integrated analysis predicted that IL-1β and M-CSF may be novel candidate target genes for inflammatory storm and that TNFSF13, IL-18, IL-2, and IL-4 may be beneficial for the recovery of COVID-19 patients.
32377375,Our study provides the first evidence of an inflammatory immune signature in the ERS, suggesting COVID-19 patients are still vulnerable after hospital discharge.
32377375,Identification of novel BCR signaling may lead to the development of vaccines and antibodies for the treatment of COVID-19.
32377468,The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has been declared a worldwide pandemic.
32377468,It was initially thought to spare children and adolescents as significantly smaller number of cases have been reported in the pediatric population in comparison to adults.
32377468,Here, we report the case of a 16-month-old female infant from Lebanon who presented with fever and severe diarrhea and tested positive for COVID-19.
32377468,Her symptoms started six days prior to presentation with no cough, rhinorrhea, or other respiratory manifestations reported.
32377468,Chest radiography showed lobar consolidation and bronchial infiltrates.
32377468,Blood culture was positive for <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i>.
32377468,Stool and urine cultures were negative.
32377468,She was treated with ceftriaxone and metronidazole.
32377468,Her RT-PCR test was negative after five days of treatment, suggesting that children can clear the virus faster than adults.
32377468,The patient likely contracted the virus from her parents, who because of the fear of social stigma hide recent history of respiratory illness.
32377468,These findings serve as a practical reference for the clinical diagnosis and medical treatment of children with COVID-19.
32377486,An infection of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) that originated from Wuhan city of China in December 2019 converted rapidly into pandemic by March 11, 2020.
32377486,To date, the number of confirmed cases and deaths has risen exponentially in more than 200 countries, with an estimated crude mortality ratio of at least over 2%.
32377486,The unpreparedness to tackle the unprecedented situation of coronavirus has contributed to the rising number of cases, which has generated an immense sense of fear and anxiety amongst the public.
32377486,It has further resulted in the inadequacy and unavailability of essential medical supplies, physicians, and healthcare workers (HCW).
32377486,Although the chief focus is on minimizing transmission through prevention, combating infection, and saving lives by ramping up the development of treatment and vaccines, very little attention is on the critical issue of physician burnout, resident burnout, and the psychological well-being of HCW.
32377486,Until now, no significant steps have been taken by the authorities to minimize the COVID-19 specific contributing factors for burnout.
32377486,The COVID-19 has posed strain on the entire healthcare system already, and it is vital to remediate the issue of physician and resident burnout urgently with concrete actions to avoid subsequent potential short-term and long-term adverse implications.
32377559,An epidemic of extreme respiratory deterrence, pneumonia and shortness of breath, the SARS-CoV-2 viral infection began in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019, and rapidly spread across China and beyond, with human to human transmission.
32377559,On February 12, 2020, World Health Organization officially named the new coronavirus disease as coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19).
32377559,Most COVID-19 patients were diagnosed with pneumonia and many were treated using Chinese medicines and other secondary therapies.
32377559,As of April 22, 2020, the total figure of infected patients has crossed 2.6 million people worldwide with over 180,000 deaths and 700,000 patients that have recovered.
32377559,Preliminary reports suggest that certain drugs, such as chloroquine and antiviral nucleotide analogues such as remdesivir, which inhibit viral replication, can target the new coronavirus, although their usefulness in the clinic is still under debate.
32377559,An expert US committee developed the US NIH guidelines for COVID-19 treatment, which was just released and will be regularly updated.
32377559,This manuscript reviews the epidemiology, etiology, mortality, COVID-19 clinical symptoms, and potential therapeutic drugs, while highlighting the seriousness and damage-induced by SARS-CoV-2.
32377596,Purpose/Objective(s): The COVID-19 pandemic is impacting all aspects of life and changing the practice of medicine.
32377596,Multiple recommendations exist on how radiation oncology practices should deal with this crisis, but little information is available on what actually happens when the COVID-19 surge arrives.
32377596,New York City experienced the first surge of COVID-19 in the United States and is now the epicenter of the global pandemic.
32377596,This study reviews the impact of COVID-19 on a hospital system in New York on aspects of medicine, nursing, radiation therapy, and administration.Materials/Methods: A retrospective review was conducted of the department of radiation oncology in a single health system in New York from 3/1/20 to 4/1/20.
32377596,Collaboration was obtained from physicians, nursing, radiation therapy, and administration to recall their policies and impact on specific duties.
32377596,A timeline was reconstructed to chronicle significant events.
32377596,Numbers were obtained for patients on treatment, treatments breaks, and COVID-19 infections amongst staff and patients.
32377596,The COVID-19 surge had a tremendous impact on the health system including cessation of all of surgeries, including oncologic surgery, as well as transfer of all inpatient oncology services to makeshift outpatient facilities.
32377596,Radiation Oncology made aggressive efforts to reduce patients on treatment to protect patients and staff as well reallocate staff and space for more acute clinical needs.
32377596,Patients on-beam were reduced by 27% from 172 to 125 by 4/1/20.
32377596,Almost all visits were changed to telemedicine within 2 weeks.
32377596,Infection rates and quarantine were quite low amongst staff and patients.
32377596,The majority of residents were deployed into COVID-19 clinical settings.
32377596,While &quot;planning for the worst&quot;, our health system was able to make necessary changes to still function at a reduced capacity.
32377596,Our experience will give other departments a concrete experience to help them make their own policies and manage expectations.
32377597,Patients with cancer are at high-risk for mortality from coronavirus-disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32377597,Radiation pneumonitis (RP) is a common toxicity of thoracic radiotherapy with overlapping clinical and imaging features with COVID-19, however, RP is treated with high-dose corticosteroids, which may exacerbate COVID-19-associated lung injury.
32377597,We reviewed patients who presented with symptoms of RP during the intensification of a regional COVID-19 epidemic to report on their clinical course and COVID-19 testing results.
32377597,The clinical course and chest computed tomography (CT) imaging findings of consecutive patients who presented with symptoms of RP in March 2020 were reviewed.
32377597,The first regional COVID-19 case was diagnosed on 3/1/2020.
32377597,All patients underwent COVID-19 qualitative RNA testing.
32377597,Four patients with clinical suspicion for RP were assessed.
32377597,Three out of four patients tested positive for COVID-19.
32377597,All patients presented with symptoms of cough and dyspnea.
32377597,Two patients had a fever, of whom only one tested positive for COVID-19.
32377597,Two patients started on an empiric high-dose corticosteroid taper for presumed RP, but both had clinical deterioration, and ultimately tested positive for COVID-19 and required hospitalization.
32377597,Chest CT findings in patients suspected of RP, but ultimately diagnosed with COVID-19 showed ground-glass opacities mostly pronounced outside the radiation field.
32377597,As this pandemic continues, patients with symptoms of RP require diagnostic attention.
32377597,We recommend that patients suspected of RP be tested for COVID-19 before starting empiric corticosteroids and for careful attention be paid to chest CT imaging in order to prevent potential exacerbation of COVID-19 in these high-risk patients.
32377638,The recent outbreak of COVID-19 has been rapidly spreading on a global scale.
32377638,To date, there is no specific vaccine against the causative virus, SARS-CoV-2, nor is there an effective medicine for treating COVID-19, thus raising concerns with respect to the effect of risk factors such as clinical course and pathophysiological parameters on disease severity and outcome in patients with COVID-19.
32377638,By extracting and analyzing all available published clinical data, we identified several major clinical characteristics associated with increased disease severity and mortality among patients with COVID-19.
32377638,Specifically, preexisting chronic conditions such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes are strongly associated with an increased risk of developing severe COVID-19; surprisingly, however, we found no correlation between chronic liver disease and increased disease severity.
32377638,In addition, we found that both acute cardiac injury and acute kidney injury are highly correlated with an increased risk of COVID-19-related mortality.
32377638,Given the high risk of comorbidity and the high mortality rate associated with tissue damage, organ function should be monitored closely in patients diagnosed with COVID-19, and this approach should be included when establishing new guidelines for managing these high-risk patients.
32377638,Moreover, additional clinical data are needed in order to determine whether a supportive therapy can help mitigate the development of severe, potentially fatal complications, and further studies are needed to identify the pathophysiology and the mechanism underlying this novel coronavirus-associated infectious disease.
32377638,Taken together, these findings provide new insights regarding clinical strategies for improving the management and outcome of patients with COVID-19.
32377677,The COVID-19 pandemic poses a high risk to older people.
32377677,The aim of this paper is to provide a rapid overview of the COVID-19 literature, with a specific focus on older adults.
32377677,We frame our findings within an overview of the disease and have also evaluated the inclusion of older people within forthcoming clinical trials.
32377677,We searched PubMed and bioRxiv/medRxiv to identify English language papers describing the testing, treatment and prognosis of COVID-19.
32377677,PubMed and bioRxiv/medRxiv searches took place on 20th and 24th March 2020, respectively.
32377677,Screening of over 1100 peer-reviewed and pre-print papers yielded n = 22 on COVID-19 testing, n = 15 on treatment and n = 13 on prognosis.
32377677,Viral-PCR and serology are the mainstays of testing but a positive diagnosis may be increasingly supported by radiological findings.
32377677,The current evidence for the effectiveness of antiviral, corticosteroid and immunotherapies is inconclusive, although trial data are largely based on younger people.
32377677,In addition to age, male gender and comorbidities, specific laboratory and radiology findings are important prognostic factors.
32377677,Evidence suggests social distancing policies could have important negative consequences, particularly if in place for an extended period.
32377677,Given the established association between increasing age and poor prognosis in COVID-19, we anticipate that this rapid review of the current and emergent evidence might form a basis on which future work can be established.
32377677,Exclusion of older people, particularly those with comorbidities, from clinical trials is well recognised and is potentially being perpetuated in the field of current COVID-19 research.
32378314,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses special challenges to immunocompromised transplant patients.
32378314,Given the paucity of proven data in treating COVID-19, management of these patients is difficult, rapidly evolving, and mainly based on anecdotal experience.
32378314,We report 2 cases of heart transplant (HT) recipients with COVID-19.
32378314,The first is a 59-year-old female with HT in 2012 who presented on March 20, 2020 with fever, hypoxia, and ground-glass opacities on chest X-ray.
32378314,She quickly progressed to acute hypoxic respiratory failure and vasoplegic shock.
32378314,Despite reduction in immunosuppression and treatment with tocilizumab, intravenous immunoglobulin, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and broad-spectrum antibiotics, she ultimately died from multiorgan failure.
32378314,The second case is a 75-year-old man with HT in 2000 who presented on April 2, 2020 after curbside testing revealed positive COVID-19.
32378314,Given a milder presentation compared to the first patient, antimetabolite was discontinued and only hydroxychloroquine was started.
32378314,Because of a lack of clinical improvement several days later, tocilizumab, methylprednisolone, and therapeutic anticoagulation were initiated.
32378314,The patient clinically improved with decreasing oxygen requirements and was discharged home.
32378314,These 2 cases highlight the wide range of different presentations of COVID-19 in HT recipients and the rapidity with which the management of these patients is evolving.
32378459,Nanotechnology and nanomedicine have excellent potential in dealing with a range of different health problems, including viruses, which are considered to be a serious challenge in the medical field.
32378459,Application of nanobiotechnology could represent a new avenue for the treatment or disinfection of viruses.
32378459,There is increasing concern regarding the control of coronaviruses, among these, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 are well known and dangerous examples.
32378459,This article aims to provide an overview of recent studies on the effectiveness of nanoparticles as diagnostic or antiviral tools against coronaviruses.
32378459,The possibilities of effectively using nanomaterials as vaccines and nanosensors in this field are also presented.
32378471,The emergences of coronaviruses have caused a serious global public health problem because their infection in humans caused the severe acute respiratory disease and deaths.
32378471,The outbreaks of lethal coronaviruses have taken place for three times within recent two decades (SARS-CoV in 2002, MERS-CoV in 2012 and SARS-CoV-2 in 2019).
32378471,Much more serious than SARS-CoV in 2002, the current SARS-CoV-2 infection has been spreading to more than 213 countries, areas or territories and causing more than two million cases up to date (17 April 2020).
32378471,Unfortunately, no vaccine and specific anti-coronavirus drugs are available at present time.
32378471,Current clinical treatment at hand is inadequate to suppress viral replication and inflammation, and reverse organ failure.
32378471,Intensive research efforts have focused on increasing our understanding of viral biology of SARS-CoV-2, improving antiviral therapy and vaccination strategies.
32378471,The animal models are important for both the fundamental research and drug discovery of coronavirus.
32378471,This review aims to summarize the animal models currently available for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and their potential use for the study of SARS-CoV-2.
32378471,We will discuss the benefits and caveats of these animal models and present critical findings that might guide the fundamental studies and urgent treatment of SARS-CoV-2-caused diseases.
32378647,The world is in the midst of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
32378647,Interleukin 6 (IL-6) inhibitor (tocilizumab) had been suggested for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients based on the concept of &quot;cytokine storm&quot; in COVID-19.
32378647,However, we still lack reliable studies to verify &quot;cytokine storm&quot; in COVID-19 pneumonia.
32378647,Furthermore, IL-6 inhibitor has potential hazards of inducing infectious diseases.
32378647,The efficacy of IL-6 monoclonal antibody-directed therapy remains to be fully evaluated.
32378729,The evidence on the pathophysiology of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 infection is rapidly growing.
32378729,Understanding why some patients suffering from COVID-19 are getting so sick, while others are not, has become an informal imperative for researchers and clinicians around the globe.
32378729,The answer to this question would allow rationalizing the fear surrounding this pandemic.
32378729,Understanding of the pathophysiology of COVID-19 relies on an understanding of interplaying mechanisms, including SARS-CoV-2 virulence, human immune response, and complex inflammatory reactions with coagulation playing a major role.
32378729,An interplay with bacterial co-infections, as well as the vascular system and microcirculation affected throughout the body should also be examined.
32378729,More importantly, a compre-hensive understanding of pathological mechanisms of COVID-19 will increase the efficacy of therapy and decrease mortality.
32378729,Herewith, presented is the current state of knowledge on COVID-19: beginning from the virus, its transmission, and mechanisms of entry into the human body, through the pathological effects on the cellular level, up to immunological reaction, systemic and organ presentation.
32378729,Last but not least, currently available and possible future therapeutic and diagnostic options are briefly commented on.
32378737,Caly, Druce (1) reported that ivermectin inhibited SARS-CoV-2 in vitro for up to 48 h using ivermectin at 5μM.
32378737,The concentration resulting in 50% inhibition (IC<sub>50,</sub> 2 µM) was &gt;35x higher than the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) after oral administration of the approved dose of ivermectin when given fasted.
32378737,Simulations were conducted using an available population pharmacokinetic model to predict total (bound and unbound) and unbound plasma concentration-time profiles after a single and repeat fasted administration of the approved dose of ivermectin (200 μg/kg), 60 mg, and 120 mg.
32378737,Plasma total Cmax was determined and then multiplied by the lung:plasma ratio reported in cattle to predict the lung Cmax after administration of each single dose.
32378737,Plasma ivermectin concentrations of total (bound and unbound) and unbound concentrations do not reach the IC<sub>50</sub> , even for a dose level 10x higher than the approved dose.
32378737,Even with the high lung:plasma ratio, ivermectin is unlikely to reach the IC<sub>50</sub> in lungs after single oral administration of the approved dose (predicted lung: 0.0873 µM) or at doses 10x higher that the approved dose administered orally (predicted lung: 0.820 µM).
32378737,In summary, the likelihood of a successful clinical trial using the approved dose of ivermectin is low.
32378737,Combination therapy should be evaluated in vitro.
32378737,Re-purposing drugs for use in COVID-19 treatment is an ideal strategy but is only feasible when product safety has been established and experiments of re-purposed drugs are conducted at clinically relevant concentrations.
32378801,In December 2019, twenty-seven pneumonia patients with unknown causes originated in South China seafood market in Wuhan.
32378801,The virus infection spread rapidly and swept through China in less than a month.
32378801,Subsequently, the virus was proven a novel coronavirus and named SARS-CoV-2.
32378801,The outbreak of novel coronavirus has been determined as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) by WHO on January 31, 2020.
32378801,Similar to other coronaviruses like the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) CoV and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) CoV, the novel coronavirus was reported to spread via respiratory droplets and close contact from human to human, which means the virus is highly infectious and dangerous.
32378801,Unfortunately, till now the virus has spread to over 200 countries/territories/areas around the world and the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is continuing to grow.
32378801,Currently, information sharing and transparency are essential for risk assessment and epidemic control in all endemic areas.
32378801,In this article, we compared SARS-CoV-2 with SARS-CoV and influenza virus, discussed current researching progress of COVID-19, including clinical characteristics, pathological changes, treatment measures, and so on.
32378805,Since December 2019, coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been increasingly spreading from its origin in Wuhan, China to many countries around the world eventuating in morbidity and mortality affecting millions of people.
32378805,This pandemic has proven to be a challenge given that there is no immediate cure, no vaccine is currently available and medications or treatments being used are still undergoing clinical trials.
32378805,There have already been examples of self-medication and overdose.
32378805,Clearly, there is a need to further define the efficacy of treatments used in the management of COVID-19.
32378805,This evidence needs to be backed by large randomised-controlled clinical trials.
32378805,In the meantime, there will no doubt be further off-label use of these medications by patients and practitioners and possibly related toxicity.
32378844,The COVID-19 outbreak is presenting the health system with new challenges, and there is a great need for knowledge about symptoms, clinical findings and course of illness in patients admitted to Norwegian hospitals with COVID-19.
32378844,In this observational qualitative study, all patients admitted to a Norwegian local hospital (Bærum Hospital) with proven COVID-19 infection were included consecutively from the start of the outbreak.
32378844,We present here patient characteristics, symptoms, clinical findings, experience of using clinical scoring systems and course of illness based on data in medical records.
32378844,In the period 9-31 March 2020, 42 patients, of whom 28 (67 %) were men, were admitted to hospital with COVID-19 infection.
32378844,The median age was 72.5 years (range 30-95).
32378844,Fever (79 %), reduced general condition (79 %), dyspnoea (69 %) and cough (67 %) were the most common symptoms.
32378844,A total of nine patients (21 %) had a critical course of illness with treatment in the Intensive Care Department and/or death during their stay in hospital.
32378844,Patients with a critical course had a higher average score on National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) on admission (7.6 vs 3.3).
32378844,Only one of the most severely ill patients scored ≥ 2 on the quick Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) on admission.
32378844,Most patients admitted to our hospital with COVID-19 had a fever and respiratory tract symptoms.
32378844,A high percentage of patients had a critical course of illness.
32378844,A NEWS2 score of ≥ 5 on admission may be a useful aid in identifying patients at risk of a critical course of illness, while CRB-65 and qSOFA score ≥ 2 proved to be of little usefulness for this purpose in our material.
32378854,Olfactory and taste disorders (OTDs) have recently been reported among patients with COVID-19, and it has been hypothesised that oral and nasal tissues may contain host cells of SARS-CoV-2.
32378854,We report on two cases (spouses) with SARS-CoV-2 infection with self-reported OTDs, but otherwise no typical respiratory symptoms of COVID-19.
32378854,A man in his nineties (index patient) had respiratory symptoms and dysgeusia, and was diagnosed with COVID-19.
32378854,His daughter-in-law and son had no respiratory COVID-19 symptoms.
32378854,However, they experienced complete loss of smell and taste, respectively, 7 and 10 days after their first close contact with the index patient.
32378854,Both tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
32378854,Our case histories support recent reports hypothesising that anosmia and ageusia may be the only symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and that SARS-CoV-2 may infect oral and nasal tissues.
32378854,Together, these findings may inform future research, diagnosis, prevention and treatment of COVID-19.
32379056,During the epidemic of COVID-19, the management model of colorectal cancer has to be changed at our center due to relatively limited medical resources.
32379056,Outpatient visits are reduced under well protected after appointment, and rigorous investigation of epidemiological history and clinical symptoms are needed.
32379056,We prefer a simple and convenient treatment regimen, which may also be postponed appropriately.
32379056,Minimally invasive CRC surgery combined with a perioperative program of enhanced recovery after surgery should be recommended.
32379056,We also focus on mental health treatments and healthy lifestyle education.
32379056,In addition, routine follow-up can be moderately delayed.
32379056,In total, adequate doctor-patient communication is also recommended throughout the treatment.
32379057,Hip fractures in the elderly account for more than half of osteoporotic fractures and represent a substantial economic and social burden.
32379057,Novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19), which began to spread in December 2019, has created challenges in the management of elderly hip fracture patients, not only by influencing the choice of operation and postoperative rehabilitation methods, but also by generating new risks for the medical staff.
32379057,During this period, our infection and orthopedic treatment unit in the center of the epidemic area effectively treated 82 elderly patients with hip fracture, and no cross-infection occurred.
32379057,Therefore, our experience in prevention and treatment is worth recommending to frontline anti-epidemic personnel.
32379114,Studies of the novel coronavirus-induced disease COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, have elucidated the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of this disease in the general population.
32379114,The present investigation summarizes the clinical characteristics and early prognosis of COVID-19 infection in a cohort of patients with fractures.
32379114,Data on 10 patients with a fracture and COVID-19 were collected from 8 different hospitals located in the Hubei province from January 1, 2020, to February 27, 2020.
32379114,Analyses of early prognosis were based on clinical outcomes and trends in laboratory results during treatment.
32379114,All 10 patients presented with limited activity related to the fracture.
32379114,The most common signs were fever, cough, and fatigue at the time of presentation (7 patients each).
32379114,Other, less common signs included sore throat (4 patients), dyspnea (5 patients), chest pain (1 patient), nasal congestion (1 patient), headache (1 patient), dizziness (3 patients), abdominal pain (1 patient), and vomiting (1 patient).
32379114,Lymphopenia (&lt;1.0 × 10 cells/L) was identified in 6 of 10 patients, 9 of 9 patients had a high serum level of D-dimer, and 9 of 9 patients had a high level of C-reactive protein.
32379114,Three patients underwent surgery, whereas the others were managed nonoperatively because of their compromised status.
32379114,Four patients died on day 8 (3 patients) or day 14 (1 patient) after admission.
32379114,The clinical outcomes for the surviving patients are not yet determined.
32379114,The clinical characteristics and early prognosis of COVID-19 in patients with fracture tended to be more severe than those reported for adult patients with COVID-19 without fracture.
32379114,This finding may be related to the duration between the development of symptoms and presentation.
32379114,Surgical treatment should be carried out cautiously or nonoperative care should be chosen for patients with fracture in COVID-19-affected areas, especially older individuals with intertrochanteric fractures.
32379114,Prognostic Level IV.
32379114,See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.
32379199,The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is becoming a global threat.
32379199,However, our understanding of the clinical characteristics and treatment of critically ill pediatric patients and their ability of transmitting the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 still remains inadequate because only a handful pediatric cases of COVID-19 have been reported.
32379199,Epidemiology, clinical characteristics, treatment, laboratory data and follow-up information and the treatment of critically ill infant were recorded.
32379199,The infant had life-threatening clinical features including high fever, septic shock, recurrent apnea, petechiae and acute kidney injury and persistent declined CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.
32379199,The duration of nasopharyngeal virus shedding lasted for 49 days even with the administration of lopinavir/ritonavir for 8 days.
32379199,The CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was partially recovered 68 days post onset of the disease.
32379199,Accumulating of effector memory CD4+ T cells (CD4+TEM) was observed among T-cell compartment.
32379199,The nucleic acid tests and serum antibody for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 of the infant's mother who kept intimate contact with the infant were negative despite no strict personal protection.
32379199,The persistent reduction of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was the typical feature of critically ill infant with COVID-19.
32379199,CD4+ and CD8+ T cells might play a key role in aggravating COVID-19 and predicts a more critical course in children.
32379199,The prolonged nasopharyngeal virus shedding was related with the severity of respiratory injury.
32379199,The transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from infant (even very critical cases) to adult might be unlikely.
32379346,The paper of Cheng H. et al., describes an interesting hypothesis regarding the organ protective effects of ACE2 activation against the malignant effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, and describes interesting previous results reporting ACE2 higher levels in children, young people and women that is coincident with a lower morbidity and health problems associated to COVID19.
32379346,In the present comment the treatment of COVID19 patients with ACE2 activators, such as diminazene aceturate (DIZE), which are currently used as antiparasitic drugs, is proposed.

32379639,This review aimed to summarize and analyze the pattern identification (PI), herbal formulae, and composition of herbs provided by recent guidelines for the treatment of pediatric COVID-19.
32379639,Seven data sources were reviewed until March 25, 2020.
32379639,We analyzed the herbal formulae included in the guidelines and performed a network analysis to identify the frequency of herbs recommended in the herbal formulae.
32379639,All 3 guidelines were provincial guidelines from China.
32379639,Our results showed that there were 4 stages, 12 PIs, and 13 herbal formulae recommended by the provincial guidelines.
32379639,These herbal formulae included a total of 56 herbs.
32379639,Based on our network analysis, Scutellariae Radix was paired with Artemisiae Annuae Herba in one cluster.
32379639,In another cluster, Armeniacae Semen was paired with Coicis Semen and Ephedrae Herba was paired with Gypsum Fibrosum.
32379639,This review serves as a reference for the use of traditional medicine in the treatment of pediatric COVID-19.
32379667,Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019(COVID-19) will experience high levels of anxiety and low sleep quality due to isolation treatment.
32379667,Some sleep-improving drugs may inhibit the respiratory system and worsen the condition.
32379667,Prolonged bedside instruction may increase the risk of medical infections.
32379667,To investigate the effect of progressive muscle relaxation on anxiety and sleep quality of COVID-19.
32379667,In this randomized controlled clinical trial, a total of 51 patients who entered the isolation ward were included in the study and randomly divided into experimental and control groups.
32379667,The experimental group used progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) technology for 30 min per day for 5 consecutive days.
32379667,During this period, the control group received only routine care and treatment.
32379667,Before and after the intervention, the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Scale (STAI) and Sleep State Self-Rating Scale (SRSS) were used to measure and record patient anxiety and sleep quality.
32379667,Finally, data analysis was performed using SPSS 25.0 software.
32379667,The average anxiety score (STAI) before intervention was not statistically significant (P = 0.730), and the average anxiety score after intervention was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.001).
32379667,The average sleep quality score (SRSS) of the two groups before intervention was not statistically significant (P = 0.838), and it was statistically significant after intervention (P &lt; 0.001).
32379667,Progressive muscle relaxation as an auxiliary method can reduce anxiety and improve sleep quality in patients with COVID-19.
32379692,A new kind of Pneumonia caused by new corona virus has been widespread in China since winter of 2019.
32379692,No effective treatment for this disease was verified, so the morbidity and mortality rate were supposed higher than flu.
32379692,The Traditional Chinese Medicine is widely used in clinical practice in China, but many other countries of the world to deal with diseases that remain clinically challenging.
32380026,To describe the rapid implementation of an adult coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) unit using pediatric physician and nurse providers in a children's hospital and to examine the characteristics and outcomes of the first 100 adult patients admitted.
32380026,We describe our approach to surge-in-place at a children's hospital to meet the local demands of the COVID-19 pandemic.
32380026,Instead of redeploying pediatric providers to work with internist-led teams throughout a medical center, pediatric physicians and nurses organized and staffed a 40-bed adult COVID-19 treatment unit within a children's hospital.
32380026,We adapted internal medicine protocols, developed screening criteria to select appropriate patients for admission, and reorganized staffing and equipment to accommodate adult patients with COVID-19.
32380026,We used patient counts and descriptive statistics to report sociodemographic, system, and clinical outcomes.
32380026,The median patient age was 46 years; 69% were male.
32380026,On admission, 78 (78%) required oxygen supplementation.
32380026,During hospitalization, 13 (13%) eventually were intubated.
32380026,Of the first 100 patients, 14 are still admitted to a medical unit, 6 are in the intensive care unit, 74 have been discharged, 4 died after transfer to the intensive care unit, and 2 died on the unit.
32380026,The median length of stay for discharged or deceased patients was 4 days (IQR 2, 7).
32380026,Our pediatric team screened, admitted, and cared for hospitalized adults by leveraging the familiarity of our system, adaptability of our staff, and high-quality infrastructure.
32380026,This experience may be informative for other healthcare systems that will be redeploying pediatric providers and nurses to address a regional COVID-19 surge elsewhere.
32380051,The outbreak of emerging infectious pneumonia caused by 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has posed an enormous threat to public health, and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) have made vast contribution to the prevention, treatment and rehabilitation of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) among Chinese population.
32380051,As an indispensable part of TCM, Chinese patent medicines (CPMs) are highly valued and critically acclaimed in their campaign to contain and tackle the epidemic, they can achieve considerable effects for both suspected cases under medical observation period, and confirmed individuals with serious underlying diseases or critical conditions.
32380051,Given this, based on the Guideline on Diagnosis and Treatment of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China, the present review summarized the basic information, clinical evidence and published literatures of recommended CPMs against COVID-19.
32380051,The details were thoroughly introduced involving compositions, therapeutic effects, clinical indications, medication history of CPMs and the profiles of corresponding research.
32380051,With regard to infected patients with different stages and syndrome, the preferable potentials and therapeutic mechanism of CPMs were addressed through the comprehensive collection of relevant literatures and on-going clinical trials.
32380051,This study could provide an insight into clinical application and underlying mechanism of recommended CPMs against COVID-19, with the aim to share the Chinese experience in clinical practice and facilitate scientific development of TCM, especially CPMs in the fierce battle of COVID-19.
32380200,An outbreak caused by 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was first identified in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.
32380200,The new virus was later named SARS-CoV-2.
32380200,The virus has affected tens of thousands of patients in the world.
32380200,The infection of SARS-CoV-2 causes severe pneumonia and even death.
32380200,It is urgently needed to find a therapeutic method to treat patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32380200,Studies showed that the surface spike (S) protein is essential for the coronavirus binding and entry of host cells.
32380200,The heptad repeats 1 and 2 (HR1 and HR2) in the S protein play a decisive role in the fusion of the viral membrane with the host cell membrane.
32380200,We predicted the HR1 and HR2 regions in S protein by sequence alignment.
32380200,We simulated a computational model of HR1/2 regions and the fusion core.
32380200,The binding energy of HR1 and HR2 of the fusion core was -33.4kCal/mol.
32380200,We then designed antivirus peptides by molecular dynamics simulation of the fusion core.
32380200,The binding energy of HR2-based antiviral peptide to HR1 was -43.0kCal/mol, which was stronger than the natural stage of the fusion core, suggesting that the predicted antiviral peptide can competitively bind with HR1 to prevent forming of the fusion core.
32380200,The antiviral peptides can prevent SARS-CoV-2 membrane fusion and can potentially be used for the prevention and treatment of infections.
32380210,This paper aims to explore the effect of four virus inactivation methods on the rapid detection results of COVID-19 nucleic acid.
32380210,Collected samples of nasopharyngeal swabs from 2 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 at the First People's Hospital of Zhaoqing City, each of sample was divided into 5 groups (groupA∼E): A:Non-inactivated raw sample; B:75 % ethanol inactivation; C:56 ℃ incubation for 30 min inactivation; D:65 ℃ incubation for 10 min inactivation; E:Pre-inactivation using RNA virus special preservation fluid added into the sampling tube to treated the nasopharyngeal swab sample separately, using real-time fluorescent RT-PCR to detect the N gene of COVID-19 and the ORF1ab gene simultaneously.
32380210,All the groups are diluted in 1:2, 1:4, 1:8 ratios.
32380210,The objectives are to compare the effect of the varied inactivation method on CT(Cycle Threshold)results in PCR, conduct correlation and Bland-Altman analysis.
32380210,For the N gene and ORF1ab gene, the CT values of 4 inactivated and Non-inactivated treatment were correlated (P＜0.001).
32380210,The results of the four treatment methods and specimens without inactivated treatment have shown good consistency.
32380210,The treatment of nasopharyngeal swab specimens using mentioned four inactivated methods had no significant effect on the subsequent detection of the new COVID-19 nucleic acid test.
32380210,Lab test-persons can flexibly adopt pre-inactivation methods to ensure the accuracy of virus nucleic acid test results, meanwhile guarantee the safety of lab test-persons.
32380315,Some disease-modifying agents commonly used to treat patients with rheumatic diseases/autoimmune disorders, such as hydroxychloroquine and colchicine, are under investigation as potential therapies for the &quot;coronavirus disease 2019&quot; (COVID-19).
32380315,However, the role of such agents as prophylactic tools is still not clear.
32380315,This is a retrospective study based on a large healthcare computerized database including all patients that were screened for the &quot;Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus type 2&quot; (SARS-CoV-2) in the study period from February 23rd 2020 to March 31st 2020.
32380315,A comparison was conducted between subjects tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and those found negative in terms of rate of administration of hydroxychloroquine/colchicine therapy.
32380315,An overall sample of 14,520 subjects were screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection and 1317 resulted positive.
32380315,No significant difference was found in terms of rates of usage of hydroxychloroquine or colchicine between those who were found positive for SARS-CoV-2 and those who were found negative (0.23% versus 0.25% for hydroxychloroquine, and 0.53% versus 0.48% for colchicine, respectively).
32380315,These findings raise doubts regarding the protective role of these medications in the battle against SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32380430,The outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-related disease (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]) has spread rapidly to a pandemic proportion, increasing the demands on health systems for the containment and management of COVID-19.
32380430,Cancer has been reported as a major risk factor for adverse outcomes of and death from COVID-19.
32380430,We extracted data from the World Health Organization's progress reports and from the Italian Council of Medicine.
32380430,In addition, we retrieved clinical data on patients with cancer and with confirmed COVID-19 in our institution.
32380430,As of 2nd April 2020, 110,574 COVID-19 cases and 13,157 deaths have been reported in Italy, representing a global share of 5.1% and 28.9% for incidence and mortality, respectively.
32380430,In Italy, we report the analysis of the Italian Medical Council on 909 patients who died from COVID-19; of whom, 16.5% were patients with cancer.
32380430,The population was enriched with subjects with multiple comorbid non-communicable diseases, with less than 1% of the population presenting no comorbid conditions.
32380430,At the patient level, we identified nine patients referred to our department in the last two months who were receiving standard-of-care or experimental medications in the curative and palliative settings.
32380430,The median age was 68 years (range = 42-79 years), and patients carried a median of one comorbid condition (0-2); two of nine patients presented with severe COVID-19 and were receiving inpatient care.
32380430,None of the patients receiving immunotherapy experienced severe adverse outcomes, and four patients were discharged with complete reversal of the clinical syndrome and SARS-CoV-2 clearance.
32380430,Learning from the experience of countries with a high burden, efforts must be made to assure the access of patients with cancer to treatments, prioritising the cancer health interventions based on their intrinsic value and limiting the exposure to an unacceptable risk of infection for both health providers and patients.
32380430,Any significant work in the design and implementation of health system actions, including clinical care, must be framed as an initiative under the global response agenda and through a community approach, with the intention of pursuing common goals to tackle COVID-19 and cancer, as 'One Community' working for 'One Health's.
32380453,This article aims at collecting all information needed for dentists regarding the COVID-19 pandemic throughout the world by reviewing articles published by now.
32380453,In late 2019, a pneumonia outbreak of uncertain etiology happened in Wuhan, China.
32380453,There were many reports related to a live-animal and seafood market, supporting that the pathogens were transferred from animals to humans, rapidly evolving into transmission from human to human.
32380453,The pathogen was classified as 2019 Novel Corona Virus (2019-nCoV), and the disease was named COrona VIrus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32380453,Given that COVID-19 has lately been detected in infected patients' saliva, the COVID-19 outbreak is an alert that all dental and other health professionals must be vigilant in defending against the infectious disease spread, and it may enable to assess whether non-invasive saliva diagnostic for COVID-19.
32380453,There has so far been no evidence from randomized controlled trials to prescribe any particular anti-nCoV treatment or vaccine, and COVID-19 management has been widely supportive.
32380453,Since the ACE-2 was expressing on oral cavity mucosa, there is a potentially huge COVID-19 infectious vulnerability risk for oral cavity and brought up a proof for the future prevention procedure in dental practice and daily life.
32380453,As a result, the whole dental teams should be vigilant and keep patients and themselves in a safe environment by following the guideline in this study.
32380474,• COVID-19 has changed the nature of medical consultations, emphasizing virtual patient counseling, with relevance for patients with diabetes insipidus (DI) or hyponatremia.
32380474,• The principles of management outlined in international guidelines still form the basis of management during COVID-19.
32380474,• The main complication of desmopressin treatment in DI is dilutional hyponatraemia.
32380474,Since plasma sodium monitoring is not always possible in times of COVID-19, we recommend to delay the desmopressin dose once a week until aquaresis occurs allowing excess retained water to be excreted.
32380474,Patients should measure their body weight daily.
32380474,• Patients with DI admitted to the hospital with COVID-19 have a high risk for mortality due to volume depletion.
32380474,Endocrinologists must supervise the fluid replacement and dosing of desmopressin.
32380474,• Patients after pituitary surgery should only drink to thirst and measure their body weight daily to early recognize the development of postoperative SIAD.
32380474,They should know hyponatraemia symptoms.
32380474,• Hyponatraemia is common in patients with pneumonia, but it is unclear if it is only a marker of disease severity or if its correction improves outcomes.
32380474,Its prevalence in patients with pneumonia due to COVID-19 is not yet known, but seems to be low.
32380474,• In contrast, hypernatraemia may develop in COVID-19 patients in ICU most probably due to insensible water losses from pyrexia, increased respiration rate and use of diuretics.
32380474,Hypernatraemic dehydration may contribute to the high rate of acute kidney injury in COVID-19.
32380474,• IV fluid replacement should be administered with caution in severe cases of COVID-19 because of the risk of pulmonary oedema.
32380475,• Clinical evaluation should guide those needing investigation • Strict adherence to COVID-19 protection measures is necessary • Alternative ways of consultations (telephone, video) should be used • Early discussion with regional/national experts about investigation and management of potential and existing patients is strongly encouraged • Patients with moderate and severe clinical features need urgent investigation and management • Patients with active Cushing's syndrome, especially when severe, are immunocompromised and social shielding is recommended • In patients with mild features or in whom a diagnosis is less likely, clinical re-evaluation should be repeated at three and six months or deferred until the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 has significantly decreased • Diagnostic pathways may need to be very different from usual recommendations in order to reduce investigations • When extensive differential diagnostic testing is not feasible, it should be deferred, and medical treatment should be initiated • Transsphenoidal pituitary surgery may be avoided during high SARS-CoV-2 viral prevalence • Medical management rather than surgery will be the used for most patients since the short- to mid-term prognosis depends in most cases on hypercortisolism rather than its cause; it should be initiated promptly to minimize the risk of infection in these immunosuppressed patients.
32380501,With the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemia, routine clinical work was immediately, deeply, and sustainably impacted in Germany and worldwide.
32380501,The infrastructure of almost all hospitals is currently redirected to provide a maximum of intensive care resources, including the necessary staff.
32380501,In parallel, routine as well as emergency clinical care for all patients in need has to be secured.
32380501,This challenge becomes particularly evident in cancer care.
32380501,In order to maintain adequate oncological care at all levels of provision and to conduct especially curative and intensive treatments with a maximum of safety, continuous adaption of the oncology care system has to be ensured.
32380501,Intensive communication with colleagues and patients is needed as is consequent expert networking and continuous reflection of the own developed strategies.
32380501,In parallel, it is of high importance to actively avoid cessation of innovation in order not to endanger the continuous improvement in prognosis of cancer patients.
32380501,This includes sustained conduction of clinical trials as well as ongoing translational research.
32380501,Here, we describe measures taken at the University Cancer Center Hamburg (UCCH) - a recognized comprehensive oncology center of excellence - during the COVID-19 crisis.
32380501,We aim to provide support and potential perspectives to generate a discussion basis on how to maintain high-end cancer care during such a crisis and how to conduct patients safely into the future.
32380511,Severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused the corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in China and has become a public health emergency of international concern<sup>1</sup>.
32380511,Because angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the cell entry receptor of SARS-CoV<sup>5</sup>, we used transgenic mice bearing human ACE2 and infected with SARS-CoV-2 to study the pathogenicity of the virus.
32380511,Weight loss and virus replication in lung were observed in hACE2 mice infected with SARS-CoV-2.
32380511,The typical histopathology was interstitial pneumonia with infiltration of significant macrophages and lymphocytes into the alveolar interstitium, and accumulation of macrophages in alveolar cavities.
32380511,Viral antigens were observed in the bronchial epithelial cells, macrophages and alveolar epithelia.
32380511,The phenomenon was not found in wild-type mice with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32380511,Notably, we have confirmed the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 in hACE2 mice.
32380511,The mouse model with SARS-CoV-2 infection will be valuable for evaluating antiviral therapeutics and vaccines as well as understanding the pathogenesis of COVID-19.
32380891,New York City is currently experiencing an outbreak of COVID-19, a highly contagious and potentially deadly virus, which is particularly dangerous for older adults.
32380891,This pandemic has led to public health policies including social distancing and stay-at-home orders.
32380891,We explore here the impact of this unique crisis on victims of elder mistreatment and people at risk of victimization.
32380891,The COVID-19 outbreak has also had a profound impact on the organizations from many sectors that typically respond to protect and serve victims of elder mistreatment.
32380891,We examine this impact and describe creative solutions developed by these organizations and initial lessons learned in New York City to help inform other communities facing this pandemic and provide guidance for future crises.
32380903,Despite initial findings indicating that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are genetically related belonging to the same virus species and that the two viruses used the same entry receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), our data demonstrated that there is no detectable cross-neutralization by SARS patient sera against SARS-CoV-2.
32380903,We also found that there are significant levels of neutralizing antibodies in recovered SARS patients 9-17 years after initial infection.
32380903,These findings will be of significant use in guiding the development of serologic tests, formulating convalescent plasma therapy strategies, and assessing the longevity of protective immunity for SARS-related coronaviruses in general as well as vaccine efficacy.
32380908,This prospective nonrandomized open-label cohort study addresses the safety and efficacy of exosomes (ExoFlo™) derived from allogeneic bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells as treatment for severe COVID-19.
32380908,During April 2020, ExoFlo was provided to 24 SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction-positive patients at a single hospital center, all of whom met criteria for severe COVID-19 as well as moderate-to-severe acute respiratory distress syndrome.
32380908,Patients received a single 15 mL intravenous dose of ExoFlo and were evaluated for both safety and efficacy from days 1 to 14 post-treatment.
32380908,All safety endpoints were met with no adverse events observed within 72 h of ExoFlo administration.
32380908,A survival rate of 83% was observed.
32380908,In total, 17 of 24 (71%) patients recovered, 3 of 24 (13%) patients remained critically ill though stable, and 4 of 24 (16%) patients expired for reasons unrelated to the treatment.
32380908,Overall, after one treatment, patients' clinical status and oxygenation improved with an average pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio (PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub>) increase of 192% (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001).
32380908,Laboratory values revealed significant improvements in absolute neutrophil count [mean reduction 32% (<i>P</i> value &lt;0.001)] and lymphopenia with average CD3<sup>+</sup>, CD4<sup>+</sup>, and CD8<sup>+</sup> lymphocyte counts increasing by 46% (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05), 45% (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05), and 46% (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001), respectively.
32380908,Likewise, acute phase reactants declined, with mean C-reactive protein, ferritin, and D-dimer reduction of 77% (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001), 43% (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001), and 42% (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05), respectively.
32380908,In conclusion, owing to its safety profile, capacity to restore oxygenation, downregulate cytokine storm, and reconstitute immunity, ExoFlo is a promising therapeutic candidate for severe COVID-19.
32380908,Future randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are needed to determine ExoFlo therapeutic potential.
32381073,Although people of all ages are susceptible to the novel coronavirus infection, which is presently named &quot;Coronavirus Disease 2019&quot; (COVID-19), there has been relatively few cases reported among children.
32381073,Therefore, it is necessary to understand the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in children and the differences from adults.
32381073,We report one pediatric case of COVID-19.
32381073,A 14-month-old boy was admitted to the hospital with a symptom of fever, and was diagnosed with a mild form of COVID-19.
32381073,The child's mother and grandmother also tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
32381073,However, the lymphocyte counts were normal.
32381073,The chest computed tomography (CT) revealed scattered ground glass opacities in the right lower lobe close to the pleura and resorption after the treatment.
32381073,The patient continued to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the nasopharyngeal swabs and stool at 17 days after the disappearance of symptoms.
32381073,The present pediatric case of COVID-19 was acquired through household transmission, and the symptoms were mild.
32381073,Lymphocyte counts did not significantly decrease.
32381073,The RNA of SARS-CoV-2 in stool and nasopharyngeal swabs remained positive for an extended period of time after the disappearance of symptoms.
32381073,This suggests that attention should be given to the potential contagiousness of pediatric COVID-19 cases after clinical recovery.
32381264,We recently reported a high cumulative incidence of thrombotic complications in critically ill patients with COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care units (ICUs) of three Dutch hospitals.
32381264,In answering questions raised regarding our study, we updated our database and repeated all analyses.
32381264,We re-evaluated the incidence of the composite outcome of symptomatic acute pulmonary embolism (PE), deep-vein thrombosis, ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction and/or systemic arterial embolism in all COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICUs of 2 Dutch university hospitals and 1 Dutch teaching hospital from ICU admission to death, ICU discharge or April 22nd 2020, whichever came first.
32381264,We studied the same 184 ICU patients as reported on previously, of whom a total of 41 died (22%) and 78 were discharged alive (43%).
32381264,The median follow-up duration increased from 7 to 14 days.
32381264,All patients received pharmacological thromboprophylaxis.
32381264,The cumulative incidence of the composite outcome, adjusted for competing risk of death, was 49% (95% confidence interval [CI] 41-57%).
32381264,The majority of thrombotic events were PE (65/75; 87%).
32381264,In the competing risk model, chronic anticoagulation therapy at admission was associated with a lower risk of the composite outcome (Hazard Ratio [HR] 0.29, 95%CI 0.091-0.92).
32381264,Patients diagnosed with thrombotic complications were at higher risk of all-cause death (HR 5.4; 95%CI 2.4-12).
32381264,Use of therapeutic anticoagulation was not associated with all-cause death (HR 0.79, 95%CI 0.35-1.8).
32381264,In this updated analysis, we confirm the very high cumulative incidence of thrombotic complications in critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.
32381426,The COVID-19 pandemic imposed a drastic reduction in surgical activity in order to respond to the influx of hospital patients and to protect uninfected patients by avoiding hospitalization.
32381426,However, little is known about the risk of infection during hospitalization or its consequences.
32381426,The aim of this work was to report a series of patients hospitalized on digestive surgery services who developed a nosocomial infection with SARS-Cov-2 virus.
32381426,This is a non-interventional retrospective study carried out within three departments of digestive surgery.
32381426,The clinical, biological and radiological data of the patients who developed a nosocomial infection with SARS-Cov-2 were collected from the computerized medical record.
32381426,From March 1, 2020 to April 5, 2020, among 305 patients admitted to digestive surgery departments, 15 (4.9%) developed evident nosocomial infection with SARS-Cov-2.
32381426,There were nine men and six women, with a median age of 62 years (35-68 years).
32381426,All patients had co-morbidities.
32381426,The reasons for hospitalization were: surgical treatment of cancer (n=5), complex emergencies (n=5), treatment of complications linked to cancer or its treatment (n=3), gastroplasty (n=1), and stoma closure (n=1).
32381426,The median time from admission to diagnosis of SARS-Cov-2 infection was 34 days (5-61 days).
32381426,In 12 patients (80%), the diagnosis was made after a hospital stay of more than 14 days (15-63 days).
32381426,At the end of the follow-up, two patients had died, seven were still hospitalized with two of them on respiratory assistance, and six patients were discharged post-hospitalization.
32381426,The risk of SARS-Cov-2 infection during hospitalization or following digestive surgery is a real and potentially serious risk.
32381426,Measures are necessary to minimize this risk in order to return to safe surgical activity.
32382072,The antineoplastic drug carmofur is shown to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M<sup>pro</sup>).
32382072,Here, the X-ray crystal structure of M<sup>pro</sup> in complex with carmofur reveals that the carbonyl reactive group of carmofur is covalently bound to catalytic Cys145, whereas its fatty acid tail occupies the hydrophobic S2 subsite.
32382072,Carmofur inhibits viral replication in cells (EC<sub>50</sub> = 24.30 μM) and is a promising lead compound to develop new antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
32382213,The COVID-19 global pandemic has generated an abundance of research quickly following the outbreak.
32382213,Within only a few months, more than a thousand studies on this topic have already appeared in the scientific literature.
32382213,In this short review, we analyse the bibliometric aspects of these studies on a macro level, as well as those addressing Coronaviruses in general.
32382213,Furthermore, through a scoping analysis of the literature on COVID-19, we identify the main safety-related dimensions that these studies have thus far addressed.
32382213,Our findings show that across various research domains, and apart from the medical and clinical aspects such as the safety of vaccines and treatments, issues related to patient transport safety, occupational safety of healthcare professionals, biosafety of laboratories and facilities, social safety, food safety, and particularly mental/psychological health and domestic safety have thus far attracted most attention of the scientific community in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic.
32382213,Our analysis also uncovers various potentially significant safety problems caused by this global health emergency which currently have attracted only limited scientific focus but may warrant more attention.
32382213,These include matters such as cyber safety, economic safety, and supply-chain safety.
32382213,These findings highlight why, from an academic research perspective, a holistic interdisciplinary approach and a collective scientific effort is required to help understand and mitigate the various safety impacts of this crisis whose implications reach far beyond the bio-medical risks.
32382213,Such holistic safety-scientific understanding of the COVID-19 crisis can furthermore be instrumental to be better prepared for a future pandemic.
32382873,COVID-19, the disease associated in December 2019 with the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, was observed for the first time in China and then spread worldwide becoming pandemic.
32382873,Currently, there is still no licensed specific antiviral treatment for the human coronavirus disease and a vaccine will not be ready soon.
32382873,However, based on experience from the use of other antiviral agents to treat similar virusses, some treatment options have been tried with some efficacy.
32382873,Clinical trials for future therapies are still ongoing.
32382873,In the meantime, prevention, control, active communication and investment in research are the only ways to overcome this challenge.
32382932,Explore how to manage oral healthcare during the COVID-19 outbreak.
32382932,In order to solve oral healthcare during the COVID-19 outbreak, our hospital has taken effective measures: build a team of experts, which provide a 24-h hotline, online video consultation, and online training and push popular science articles on WeChat.
32382932,For the treatment of emergency patients aside from routine epidemic prevention measures, some special measures for oral treatment need to be added.
32382932,From January 23, 2020, to March 2, 2020, a total of 3035 patients received oral therapy during the COVID-19 epidemic in our hospital.
32382932,To our knowledge, no oral health worker or patient has been infected with COVID-19 due to oral treatment, and no patients have complained about the suspension of treatment by complaints hotline.
32382932,COVID-19 is a novel challenge for oral healthcare.
32382932,Attention should be paid to oral healthcare during the outbreak of COVID-19.
32382932,These experiences of oral healthcare can be used as a reference by stomatological hospitals and oral clinics during public health emergencies.
32383125,The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in December 2019 causing the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.
32383125,Currently, there is a lack of evidence-based therapies to prevent COVID-19 following exposure to the virus, or to prevent worsening of symptoms following confirmed infection.
32383125,We describe the design of a clinical trial of hydroxychloroquine for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) and pre-emptive therapy (PET) for COVID-19.
32383125,We will conduct two nested multicentre international double-blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials of hydroxychloroquine for: 1) PEP of asymptomatic household contacts or healthcare workers exposed to COVID-19 within the past four days, and 2) PET for symptomatic outpatients with COVID-19 showing symptoms for less than four days.
32383125,We will recruit 1,500 patients each for the PEP and PET trials.
32383125,Participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive five days of hydroxychloroquine or placebo.
32383125,The primary PEP trial outcome will be the incidence of symptomatic COVID-19.
32383125,The primary PET trial outcome will be an ordinal scale of disease severity (not hospitalized, hospitalized without intensive care, hospitalization with intensive care, or death).
32383125,Participant screening, informed consent, and follow-up will be exclusively internet-based with appropriate regulatory and research ethics board approvals in Canada and the United States.
32383125,These complementary randomized-controlled trials are innovatively designed and adequately powered to rapidly answer urgent questions regarding the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine to reduce virus transmission and disease severity of COVID-19 during a pandemic.
32383125,In-person participant follow-up will not be conducted to facilitate social distancing strategies and reduce risks of exposure to study personnel.
32383125,Innovative trial approaches are needed to urgently assess therapeutic options to mitigate the global impact of this pandemic. clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04308668); registered 16 March, 2020.
32383183,The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China at the end of 2019 has spread throughout the world and caused many thousands of deaths.
32383183,The previous study reported a higher severe status rate and mortality rate in male patients in China.
32383183,However, the reason underlying this difference has not been reported.
32383183,The convalescent plasma containing a high level of SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody has been used in clinical therapy and achieved good effects in China.
32383183,In this study, to compare the differences of the SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody between male and female patients, a total number of 331 patients confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled.
32383183,The serum of these patients was collected during hospitalization and detected for the SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody.
32383183,Our data showed that the concentration of IgG antibody in mild, general, and recovering patients showed no difference between male and female patients.
32383183,In severe status, compared with male patients, there were more female patients having a relatively high concentration of serum SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody.
32383183,In addition, the generation of IgG antibody in female patients was stronger than male patients in disease early phase.
32383183,Our study identified a discrepancy in the SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody level in male and female patients, which may be a potential cause leading to a different outcome of Coronavirus Disease 2019 between sex.
32383234,COVID-19, first appeared in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, has been spreading quickly throughout the world.
32383234,We reviewed the evidence on cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 based on PubMed database.
32383234,The searching strategy was (COVID* or coronavirus*) and (dermatol* or skin* or cutaneous*).
32383234,The publication time was limited to 2019 onward.
32383234,After independent review by two authors, 14 studies with 228 confirmed cases were included in the analysis.
32383234,A total of 60 patients developed skin rashes, and the age ranged from 8 to 84.
32383234,Exanthematous eruptions potentially related to COVID-19 infection were highly variable and heterogeneous.
32383234,Skin lesions mainly appeared erythematous, urticarial, and vesicular (chicken pox-like or varicelliform).
32383234,Petechiae rash, livedo reticularis, and reactivation of oral HSV-1 were also observed in single cases.
32383234,Newly reported eruptions like vascular lesions and peculiar (perniosis-like) skin lesions caused concern among dermatologists.
32383234,Exanthems were widely distributed and were primarily located on the trunk.
32383234,Associated symptoms, latency time, treatment, and prognosis were also carefully summarized.
32383234,This study reviewed the recently published COVID-19 studies with skin manifestations, which may pave the way for further research.
32383269,Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) outbreak due to novel coronavirus or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has come out as a major threat for mankind in recent times.
32383269,It is continually taking an enormous toll on mankind by means of increasing number of deaths, associated comorbidities, and socioeconomic loss around the globe.
32383269,Unavailability of chemotherapeutics/vaccine has posed tremendous challenges to scientists and doctors for developing an urgent therapeutic strategy.
32383269,In this connection, the present in silico study aims to understand the sequence divergence of spike protein (the major infective protein of SARS-CoV-2), its mode of interaction with the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptor (ACE2) receptor of human and related animal hosts/reservoir.
32383269,Moreover, the involvement of the human Toll-like receptors (TLRs) against the spike protein has also been demonstrated.
32383269,Our data indicated that the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 is phylogenetically close to bat coronavirus and strongly binds with ACE2 receptor protein from both human and bat origin.
32383269,We have also found that cell surface TLRs, especially TLR4 is most likely to be involved in recognizing molecular patterns from SARS-CoV-2 to induce inflammatory responses.
32383269,The present study supported the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 from a bat and also revealed that TLR4 may have a crucial role in the virus-induced inflammatory consequences associated with COVID-19.
32383269,Therefore, selective targeting of TLR4-spike protein interaction by designing competitive TLR4-antagonists could pave a new way to treat COVID-19.
32383269,Finally, this study is expected to improve our understanding on the immunobiology of SARS-CoV-2 and could be useful in adopting spike protein, ACE2, or TLR-guided intervention strategy against COVID-19 shortly.
32383284,A 48-year-old woman with a past medical history of migraines and hyperlipidemia presented due to severe retrosternal chest pain with no other associated signs or symptoms.
32383284,The patient was hemodynamically stable and was found to have an elevated troponin with electrocardiogram showing no ischemic changes.
32383284,Computed tomography of the coronary arteries showed a left dominant system with dissection extending from the mid-to-distal left anterior descending (LAD) artery.
32383284,The patient was subsequently discharged on medical therapy but returned 3 days later due to worsening chest pain.
32383284,Electrocardiogram revealed inferior and anteroseptal ST segment changes with peak troponin of 14.9 ng/ml (reference range &lt;0.80 ng/ml).
32383284,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) nasopharyngeal swab was performed prior to urgent coronary angiogram.
32383284,Coronary angiogram was performed with full personal protective equipment for respiratory and droplet precautions due to pending COVID-19 testing results.
32383284,Angiogram revealed spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) extending from the ostium of the LAD to the distal vessel.
32383284,COVID-19 testing returned positive while in intensive care unit.
32383284,The patient was not a percutaneous coronary intervention candidate due to the extent of the dissection and was not a surgical candidate due to a lack of graftable target and medical management was continued.
32383284,To our knowledge, this case is the first in which SCAD has been reported in the LAD in a patient with COVID-19 with no other symptoms of respiratory illness or symptoms classically associated with the novel coronavirus.
32383284,SCAD should be considered on the differential as one of the various cardiac manifestations of COVID-19 infection.
32383430,Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a highly contagious disease caused by severe adult respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 that has resulted in the current global pandemic.
32383430,Currently, there is no available treatment proven to be effective against COVID-19, but multiple medications, including hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), are used off label.
32383430,We report the case of a 60-year-old woman without any cardiac history who developed right bundle brunch block and critically prolonged corrected electrocardiographic QT interval (QTc 631 ms) after treatment for 3 days with HCQ, which resolved on discontinuation of the medication.
32383430,This case highlights a significant and potentially life-threatening complication of HCQ use.
32383530,The coronavirus pandemic has led to a dramatically different way of working for many therapists working with eating disorders, where telehealth has suddenly become the norm.
32383530,However, many clinicians feel ill equipped to deliver therapy via telehealth, while adhering to evidence-based interventions.
32383530,This article draws together clinician experiences of the issues that should be attended to, and how to address them within a telehealth framework.
32383530,Seventy clinical colleagues of the authors were emailed and invited to share their concerns online about how to deliver cognitive-behavioral therapy for eating disorders (CBT-ED) via telehealth, and how to adapt clinical practice to deal with the problems that they and others had encountered.
32383530,After 96 hr, all the suggestions that had been shared by 22 clinicians were collated to provide timely advice for other clinicians.
32383530,A range of themes emerged from the online discussion.
32383530,A large proportion were general clinical and practical domains (patient and therapist concerns about telehealth; technical issues in implementing telehealth; changes in the environment), but there were also specific considerations and clinical recommendations about the delivery of CBT-ED methods.
32383530,Through interaction and sharing of ideas, clinicians across the world produced a substantial number of recommendations about how to use telehealth to work with people with eating disorders while remaining on track with evidence-based practice.
32383530,These are shared to assist clinicians over the period of changed practice.
32383624,The hypothesis has been proposed that patients COVID-19 positive, under anti-hypertensive treatment with angiotensin enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor-blockers, might have a worse or a better clinical prognosis.
32383624,This might be due to the fact that ACE2 is the receptor for the virus to enter human cells, but, on the contrary, that ACE2 expression is downregulated following SARS-1 infection, resulting in disproportionate activation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and exacerbated pneumonia progression.
32383624,However, no solid clinical data are available at the present moment to support or disprove such hypotheses.
32383624,We announce in this letter that a large multicentre case-control study has been started in Italy that is the country with a very high impact of COVID-19 infection.
32383624,We hope that our letter will encourage other clinical centres, even outside Italy, to join our study.
32384004,The Novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic is changing how we deliver expert palliative care.
32384004,We can expect many to die prematurely secondary to COVID-19 across the United States.
32384004,We present a case of how several hospital systems-based interventions, intended to slow viral spread and to protect health care workers, have inadvertently created barriers to routine palliative interventions in this patient population.
32384004,Isolation of patients, limitation of visitors and interdisciplinary support, and changes in nursing and provider assessment have all had their impact on how we deliver palliative care.
32384004,These barriers have altered many aspects of our established workflow and algorithms for care, including changes in communication, goals of care discussions, how providers and nurses are monitoring for symptoms, and end-of-life monitoring.
32384004,These challenges required real-time solutions such as technology utilization, proposing a change in medical delivery systems, and reducing redundancy to preserve personal protective equipment.
32384004,To continue to deliver quality care for this patient population, palliative medicine must adapt quickly.
32384045,To evaluate lymphopenia as a marker for coronavirus disease severity, we conducted a meta-analysis of 10 studies.
32384045,Severe illness was associated with lower lymphocyte and higher leukocyte counts.
32384045,Using these markers for early identification of patients with severe disease may help healthcare providers prioritize the need to obtain therapy.
32384183,A new disease (COVID-19) caused by a coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that appeared in China at the end of 2019 is currently spreading globally.
32384183,This emerging virus is mainly responsible for respiratory tract infections and potentially fatal pneumonia, mainly in more frail patients.
32384183,Persons with haemophilia of variable severity and from all parts of the world will likely be infected and develop COVID-19.
32384183,We here propose practical guidance for the in-hospital specific management of haemophilia persons with COVID-19 including their possible transfer to intensive care unit.
32384183,Rapid identification of the haemophilia status, undelayed and regular liaison with the haemophilia team, proper therapy with factor concentrates or alternative treatments appear instrumental to prevent haemophilia-related complications in this setting.
32384183,Information of patients and their families about COVID-19, psychological support and good appreciation of the impact of haemophilia on therapeutic decisions including end of life directives are also addressed.
32384227,Obesity has been recognized as an independent risk factor in other viral infections such as H1N1 (1).
32384227,Although data are scarce at this stage, there is also an unexplained increased prevalence of obesity in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 admitted to the intensive care units (ICU) (2).
32384516,Novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) also known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an enveloped, non-segmented positive-sense RNA virus belonging to the beta-coronaviridae family.
32384516,This virus is known to cause severe bilateral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) which can lead to difficulty breathing requiring mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit management.
32384516,A 77-year-old female with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia who presented as a transfer to our hospital facility with worsening fevers, cough, and respiratory distress.
32384516,Chest X-rays revealed bilateral infiltrates worse at the lung bases and CT scan of the chest showed bilateral ground-glass opacities consistent with COVID-19.
32384516,While our testing revealed a negative COVID-19 result at our institution, the result at a previous hospital returned a positive result.
32384516,She was being treated aggressively in the intensive care unit with high dose intravenous ascorbic acid, hydroxychloroquine, and anti-interleukin-6 monoclonal antibody.
32384516,She also received a loading dose of remdesivir however was unable to complete the course due to organ failure and requirement of vasopressors for hemodynamic stability.
32384516,She remained critically ill and was eventually placed on comfort care as per the family's wishes and passed away.
32384516,With a rapidly growing death rate and more than 200,000 confirmed cases worldwide, COVID-19 has become a global pandemic and major hit to our healthcare systems.
32384516,While several companies have already begun vaccine trials and healthcare facilities have been using a wide-range of medications to treat the virus and symptoms, there is not yet an approved medication regimen for COVID-19 infections.
32384516,The alarming increase in cases per day adds additional pressure to find a cure and decrease the global health burden and mortality rate.
32384798,(1) Background: The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease (COVID-19) in China at the end of 2019 has caused a large global outbreak.
32384798,Systemic ozone therapy (OT) could be potentially useful in the clinical management of several complications secondary to SARS-CoV-2.
32384798,The rationale and mechanism of action has already been proven clinically in other viral infections and has been shown in research studies to be highly effective at decreasing organ damage mediated by inflammation and oxidative stress.
32384798,This review summarizes the OT studies that illustrate the possible cytoprotective mechanism of action of ozone and its physiological by-products in target organs affected by SARS-CoV-2.
32384798,(2) Methods: This review encompasses a total of 74 peer-reviewed original articles.
32384798,It is mainly focused on ozone as a modulator of the NF-κ B/Nrf2 pathways and IL-6/IL-1β expression.
32384798,(3) Results: In experimental models and the few existent clinical studies, homeostasis of the free radical and antioxidant balance by OT was associated with a modulation of NF-κ B/Nrf2 balance and IL-6 and IL-1β expression.
32384798,These molecular mechanisms support the cytoprotective effects of OT against tissue damage present in many inflammatory diseases, including viral infections.
32384798,(4) Conclusions: The potential cytoprotective role of OT in the management of organ damage induced by COVID-19 merits further research.
32384798,Controlled clinical trials are needed.
32384917,Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has presently become a rapidly spreading and devastating global pandemic.
32384917,Veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-V ECMO) may serve as life-saving rescue therapy for refractory respiratory failure in the setting of acute respiratory compromise such as that induced by SARS-CoV-2.
32384917,While still little is known on the true efficacy of ECMO in this setting, the natural resemblance of seasonal influenza's characteristics with respect to acute onset, initial symptoms, and some complications prompt to ECMO implantation in most severe, pulmonary decompensated patients.
32384917,The present review summarizes the evidence on ECMO management of severe ARDS in light of recent COVID-19 pandemic, at the same time focusing on differences and similarities between SARS-CoV-2 and ECMO in terms of hematological and inflammatory interplay when these two settings merge.
32385132,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a pandemic disease globally.
32385132,Although COVID-19 directly invades lungs, it also involves the nervous system.
32385132,Therefore, patients with nervous system involvement as the presenting symptoms in the early stage of infection may easily be misdiagnosed and their treatment delayed.
32385132,They become silent contagious sources or 'virus spreaders'.
32385132,In order to help neurologists to better understand the occurrence, development and prognosis, we have developed this consensus of prevention and management of COVID-19.
32385132,It can also assist other healthcare providers to be familiar with and recognise COVID-19 in their evaluation of patients in the clinic and hospital environment.
32385146,The pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has placed an unprecedented burden on healthcare systems around the world.
32385146,In patients who experience severe disease, acute respiratory distress is often accompanied by a pathological immune reaction, sometimes referred to as 'cytokine storm'.
32385146,One hallmark feature of the profound inflammatory state seen in patients with COVID-19 who succumb to pneumonia and hypoxia is marked elevation of serum cytokines, especially interferon gamma, tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 17 (IL-17), interleukin 8 (IL-8) and interleukin 6 (IL-6).
32385146,Initial experience from the outbreaks in Italy, China and the USA has anecdotally demonstrated improved outcomes for critically ill patients with COVID-19 with the administration of cytokine-modulatory therapies, especially anti-IL-6 agents.
32385146,Although ongoing trials are investigating anti-IL-6 therapies, access to these therapies is a concern, especially as the numbers of cases worldwide continue to climb.
32385146,An immunology-informed approach may help identify alternative agents to modulate the pathological inflammation seen in patients with COVID-19.
32385146,Drawing on extensive experience administering these and other immune-modulating therapies, the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer offers this perspective on potential alternatives to anti-IL-6 that may also warrant consideration for management of the systemic inflammatory response and pulmonary compromise that can be seen in patients with severe COVID-19.
32385187,To outline changes made to a neurology residency program in response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32385187,In early March 2020, the first cases of COVID-19 were announced in the United States.
32385187,New York City quickly became the epicenter of a global pandemic, and our training program needed to rapidly adapt to the increasing number of inpatient cases while being mindful of protecting providers and continuing education.
32385187,Many of these changes unfolded over days, including removing residents from outpatient services, minimizing the number of residents on inpatient services, deploying residents to medicine services and medical intensive care units, converting continuity clinic patient visits to virtual options, transforming didactics to online platforms only, and maintaining connectedness in an era of social distancing.
32385187,We have been able to accomplish this through daily virtual meetings among leadership, faculty, and residents.
32385187,Over time, our program has successfully rolled out initiatives to service the growing number of COVID-related inpatients while maintaining neurologic care for those in need and continuing our neurologic education curriculum.
32385187,It has been necessary and feasible for our residency training program to undergo rapid structural changes to adapt to a medical crisis.
32385187,The key ingredients in doing this successfully have been flexibility and teamwork.
32385187,We suspect that many of the implemented changes will persist long after the COVID-19 crisis has passed and will change the approach to neurologic and medical training.
32385225,During any epidemic of infectious diseases, pregnant women constitute an extremely sensitive group due to altered physiology and immune functions, and thus altered susceptibility to infection.
32385225,With regard to the management of pregnant COVID-19 patients, in addition to the treatment of the infection itself, which is not that different from generally accepted principles, it is interesting to consider which obstetric procedures should be used to minimize the adverse effects on mother and child.
32385225,Questions arise concerning the continuation of pregnancy, how to terminate the pregnancy, the possibility of virus transmission through the placenta, isolation of the newborn after birth, and breastfeeding.
32385225,The aim of this study was to review the current state of knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease in pregnant women.
32385225,Because the epidemic began in China, most of the available literature comes from studies conducted there.
32385225,The studies used to prepare this review article are the first non-randomized studies containing small groups of examined women.
32385225,They do not provide clear indications, but show that in an epidemic situation, special care should be taken in pregnancy management, making decisions about termination of pregnancy, and handling of the newborn baby to minimize the risk of subsequent health consequences.
32385225,Further analysis is needed on the incidence of COVID-19 among pregnant women and its consequences.
32385225,This will allow us to develop recommendations on how to deal with patients in the future in case of repeated epidemic emergencies.
32385458,The COVID-19 situation has seen the cessation of all non-urgent dental care in the UK.
32385458,Regular practice activity has come to a virtual standstill and the dental industry has seen a very significant reduction in its provision of products and services.
32385458,There are differing government financial mitigations in place across dental practices for NHS and, to an extent private, activity, as well as for the dental industry.
32385458,Dentistry is generally classified in the very high-risk category of aerosol production through many aerosol generating procedures (AGPs).
32385458,To facilitate any move towards the resumption of widespread dental treatment, possibly without mass vaccination or the widespread use of antibody testing, the aerosol issue will need to be addressed and solved.
32385458,From a dental industry perspective, equipment and product manufacturers and suppliers are building upon, and further developing, the industry's extremely close relationship and partnership with the dental profession, in order to develop and implement new ways of thinking and new approaches, products and techniques to protect patients and clinicians, focusing on a return to the more widespread provision of dentistry.
32385628,The effects of smoking on Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) are currently unknown.
32385628,The purpose of this study was to systematically examine the prevalence of current smoking among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in China, considering the high-population smoking prevalence in China (26.6%).
32385628,A systematic review of the literature (PubMed) was performed on April 1.
32385628,Thirteen studies examining the clinical characteristics of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in China and presenting data on the smoking status were found.
32385628,The pooled prevalence of current smoking from all studies was calculated by random-effect meta-analysis.
32385628,To address the possibility that some smokers had quit shortly before hospitalization and were classified as former smokers on admission to the hospital, we performed a secondary analysis in which all former smokers were classified as current smokers.
32385628,A total of 5960 patients were included in the studies identified.
32385628,The current smoking prevalence ranged from 1.4% (95% CI 0.0-3.4%) to 12.6% (95% CI 10.6-14.6%).
32385628,An unusually low prevalence of current smoking was observed from the pooled analysis (6.5%, 95% CI 4.9-8.2%) as compared to population smoking prevalence in China.
32385628,The secondary analysis, classifying former smokers as current smokers, found a pooled estimate of 7.3% (95% CI 5.7-8.9%).
32385628,In conclusion, an unexpectedly low prevalence of current smoking was observed among patients with COVID-19 in China, which was approximately 1/4th the population smoking prevalence.
32385628,Although the generalized advice to quit smoking as a measure to reduce health risk remains valid, the findings, together with the well-established immunomodulatory effects of nicotine, suggest that pharmaceutical nicotine should be considered as a potential treatment option in COVID-19.
32385672,The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged to be the biggest global health threat worldwide, which has now infected over 1.7 million people and claimed more than 100,000 lives around the world.
32385672,Under these unprecedented circumstances, there are no well-established guidelines for cancer patients.
32385672,The risk for serious disease and death in COVID-19 cases increases with advancing age and presence of comorbid health conditions.
32385672,Since the emergence of the first case in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, tremendous research efforts have been underway to understand the mechanisms of infectivity and transmissibility of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), a fatal virus responsible for abysmal survival outcomes.
32385672,To minimize the mortality rate, it becomes prudent to identify symptoms promptly and employ treatments appropriately.
32385672,Even though no cure has been established, multiple clinical trials are underway to determine the most optimal strategy.
32385672,Managing cancer patients under these circumstances is rather challenging, given their vulnerable status and the aggressive nature of their underlying disease.
32385672,In this comprehensive review, we discuss the impact of COVID-19 on health and the immune system of those affected, reviewing the latest treatment approaches and ongoing clinical trials.
32385672,Additionally, we discuss challenges faced while treating cancer patients and propose potential approaches to manage this vulnerable population during this pandemic.
32385712,Severe coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is characterized by pulmonary hyper-inflammation and potentially life-threatening &quot;cytokine storms&quot;.
32385712,Controlling the local and systemic inflammatory response in COVID-19 may be as important as anti-viral therapies.
32385712,Endogenous lipid autacoid mediators, referred to as eicosanoids, play a critical role in the induction of inflammation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production.
32385712,SARS-CoV-2 may trigger a cell death (&quot;debris&quot;)-induced &quot;eicosanoid storm&quot;, including prostaglandins and leukotrienes, which in turn initiates a robust inflammatory response.
32385712,A paradigm shift is emerging in our understanding of the resolution of inflammation as an active biochemical process with the discovery of novel endogenous specialized pro-resolving lipid autacoid mediators (SPMs), such as resolvins.
32385712,Resolvins and other SPMs stimulate macrophage-mediated clearance of debris and counter pro-inflammatory cytokine production, a process called inflammation resolution.
32385712,SPMs and their lipid precursors exhibit anti-viral activity at nanogram doses in the setting of influenza without being immunosuppressive.
32385712,SPMs also promote anti-viral B cell antibodies and lymphocyte activity, highlighting their potential use in the treatment of COVID-19.
32385712,Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) inhibitors stabilize arachidonic acid-derived epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), which also stimulate inflammation resolution by promoting the production of pro-resolution mediators, activating anti-inflammatory processes, and preventing the cytokine storm.
32385712,Both resolvins and EETs also attenuate pathological thrombosis and promote clot removal, which is emerging as a key pathology of COVID-19 infection.
32385712,Thus, both SPMs and sEH inhibitors may promote the resolution of inflammation in COVID-19, thereby reducing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and other life-threatening complications associated with robust viral-induced inflammation.
32385712,While most COVID-19 clinical trials focus on &quot;anti-viral&quot; and &quot;anti-inflammatory&quot; strategies, stimulating inflammation resolution is a novel host-centric therapeutic avenue.
32385712,Importantly, SPMs and sEH inhibitors are currently in clinical trials for other inflammatory diseases and could be rapidly translated for the management of COVID-19 via debris clearance and inflammatory cytokine suppression.
32385712,Here, we discuss using pro-resolution mediators as a potential complement to current anti-viral strategies for COVID-19.
32385829,The COVID-19 outbreak is rapidly spread over the world and kills infected patients.
32385829,There is no proven medication for its treatment, so, all of the medications used for treatment are considered to be off-label.
32385829,Off-label uses are not under regulation in the outbreak because there is no specific regulation for this condition.
32385829,In this short communication we aim at describing two ways of off-label use as clinical practice or investigational use.
32385829,Further, we will describe the third way of off-label use, we named it pseudo-research and then we will state the most possible ethical challenges of off-label use for better perceptions and responsibility.
32385829,The WHO considers off-label uses as country-specific.
32385829,All international regulatory bodies consider off-label prescription as the physician's responsibility and legal by necessitating some requirements.
32385829,There is no international guideline for regulating investigational off-label uses as clinical practice.
32385829,There are different types of approaches, none of them is comprehensive and conclusive.
32385829,Furthermore, respecting the four ethical principles necessitates codification and strict regulation of off-label uses either as clinical practice or investigational.
32385829,Besides, compilation of a special guideline based on ethical principles especially non-maleficence and autonomy for investigational off-label uses in disasters is highly recommended.
32385859,Novel coronavirus 2019 (SARS-CoV2) pandemic has particularly affected Italy, with a profound impact on the therapeutic strategy for complex disorder such as psoriasis, whose extensive skin damage might expose to an increased infective risk compared to the general population.
32385859,Psoriasis treatment relies on immunosuppression, and although most experts agree that the benefit-to risk-ratio is in favor of maintaining selective biologic therapies, and small molecules such as apremilast, they recommend dismission if severe COVID-19 symptoms occur.
32385891,The Precision Medicine Era has helped to better manage patients with immunological and oncological disease, improving the quality of life of this class of patients.
32385891,Regarding the management of these patients and positivity to SARS-Cov2, currently, limited data is available and information is evolving.
32385891,In this quick review we have analyzed the mechanisms of action and related infective risk of drugs used for the treatment of immune-mediated and oncologic skin conditions during the daily clinical practice.
32385891,In general immunosuppressant and antineoplastic agents for dermatologic treatments do not require suspension and do not require special measures, if not those commonly observed.
32385891,In the case of a COVID19 patient with complication (such as pneumonia, respiratory failure), treatment suspension should always be considered after taking into account the general condition of the patient, the risk-benefit ratio and the pathophysiology of COVID19 infection.
32385891,The COVID19 emergency pandemic does not imply an under-treatment of existing skin conditions, which together with the SARS-Cov2 infection may jeopardize the patient's life.

32386027,Chinese administrations have carried out immediate and prompt measures to stop the spread of the virus.
32386027,Wuhan city has been shut down since Jan. 23, and more than 30 thousand medical workers have been recruited to Hubei province.
32386027,Two temporary hospitals were constructed to treat severe pneumonia patients, and 15 mobile cabin hospitals were built to treat mild pneumonia cases.
32386027,Significant improvement regarding the pathogenesis, epidemiology, and diagnosis and therapy for the COVID-19 has been achieved to stop the spread of the epidemics.
32386027,2019年12月下旬在中国武汉暴发的2019冠状病毒病给中国人民，乃至全球人类的健康带来严重威胁。
32386027,目前感染病例数仍在不断上升，截至2020年2月20日，确诊病例已经达到74 576人，死亡病例达到2 118人。
32386027,面对这一严重疫情，中国采取了史无前例的举措来控制疾病流行，如对武汉采取“封城”措施，调派全国多支医疗队，超过3万余名医务工作者支援湖北，临时建立两家医院治疗重症患者，建设15家方舱医院收治轻症患者。
32386027,在病原体鉴定、流行病学、临床诊疗等多个领域进行研究，取得显著成绩，有效控制了疫情蔓延。.
32386125,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Global Rheumatology Alliance (C19-GRA) was formed in March 2020 as a grassroots organization to coordinate the response of the international rheumatology community to the pandemic [1].
32386125,The C19-GRA launched an international, secure, de-identified physician registry of patients with rheumatic diseases infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to provide insights into the management and treatment of COVID-19 in this population.
32386431,We have read with great interest the letter of the European Task Force on Atopic Dermatitis (ETFAD) on SARS-CoV-2-infection and atopic dermatitis published in JEADV (March 2020)<sup>1</sup> in which the authors state: &quot;Targeted treatment selectively interfering with type-2 inflammation such as dupilumab is not considered to increase the risk for viral infections and might thus be preferred …in a situation such as COVID-19 pandemic&quot;.<sup>1</sup>.
32386441,The Public Health Agency of Sweden has analysed how many pregnant and postpartum women with SARS-CoV-2 infection have been treated in intensive care units (ICU) in Sweden between the March 19 and April 20, 2020, compared with non-pregnant women of similar age.
32386441,Cases were identified in a special reporting module within the Swedish Intensive Care Registry (SIR).
32386441,Fifty-three women aged 20-45 years with SARS-CoV-2 were reported in SIR, and thirteen (n=13) of these women were either pregnant or postpartum (&lt;1 week).
32386441,The results indicate that the risk of being admitted to ICU may be higher in pregnant and postpartum women with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 in Sweden, compared to non-pregnant women of similar age.
32386448,The antimalarials, Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), and the antivirals Lopinavir/Ritonavir have been recently recorded as having anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) effects.<sup>1</sup> In particular, regarding Italy, one of the countries most affected by the pandemic, the Italian Society of Infectious and Tropical disease (Lombardy section) has recommended the use of HCQ for treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32386460,Different skin manifestations of COVID-19 are being reported.
32386460,Acral lesions on the hands and feet, closely resembling chilblains, have been recognized during the peak incidence of the COVID-19 pandemic.
32386460,A retrospective review of 22 children and adolescents with chilblain-like lesions seen over a short period of time in the Emergency Department of a children's hospital during the peak incidence of COVID-19 in Madrid, Spain.
32386460,All patients had lesions clinically consistent with chilblains of the toes or feet, with three also having lesions of the fingers.
32386460,Pruritus and mild pain were the only skin symptoms elicited, and only 10 had mild respiratory and/or GI symptoms.
32386460,None had fever.
32386460,Coagulation tests, hemogram, serum chemistry, and lupus anticoagulant were normal in all patients tested.
32386460,One out of 16 tested cases had elevated D-dimer results, but without systemic symptoms or other laboratory anomalies.
32386460,SARS-CoV-2 PCR tested in 19 cases was positive in just one case.
32386460,Skin biopsies obtained in six patients were consistent with chilblains.
32386460,On follow-up, all cases showed spontaneous marked improvement or complete healing.
32386460,Acute chilblains were observed during COVID-19 pandemic in children and teenagers.
32386460,It is a mildly symptomatic condition with an excellent prognosis, usually requiring no therapy.
32386460,Etiopathogenesis remains unknown.
32386514,COVID-19 is a rapidly spreading virus infection that has quickly caused extensive burden to individual, families, countries, and the globe.
32386514,No intervention has yet been proven effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
32386514,Some randomized clinical trials assessing the effects of different drugs have been published, and more are currently underway.
32386514,There is an urgent need for a living, dynamic systematic review that continuously evaluates the beneficial and harmful effects of all available interventions for COVID-19.
32386514,We will conduct a living systematic review based on searches of major medical databases (e.g., MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL) and clinical trial registries from their inception onwards to identify relevant randomized clinical trials.
32386514,We will update the literature search once a week to continuously assess if new evidence is available.
32386514,Two review authors will independently extract data and perform risk of bias assessment.
32386514,We will include randomized clinical trials comparing any intervention for the treatment of COVID-19 (e.g., pharmacological interventions, fluid therapy, invasive or noninvasive ventilation, or similar interventions) with any comparator (e.g., an &quot;active&quot; comparator, standard care, placebo, no intervention, or &quot;active placebo&quot;) for participants in all age groups with a diagnosis of COVID-19.
32386514,Primary outcomes will be all-cause mortality and serious adverse events.
32386514,Secondary outcomes will be admission to intensive care, mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy, quality of life, and non-serious adverse events.
32386514,The living systematic review will include aggregate data meta-analyses, Trial Sequential Analyses, network meta-analysis, and individual patient data meta-analyses.
32386514,Risk of bias will be assessed with domains, an eight-step procedure will be used to assess if the thresholds for clinical significance are crossed, and the certainty of the evidence will be assessed by Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE).
32386514,COVID-19 has become a pandemic with substantial mortality.
32386514,A living systematic review evaluating the beneficial and harmful effects of pharmacological and other interventions is urgently needed.
32386514,This review will continuously inform best practice in treatment and clinical research of this highly prevalent disease.
32386514,PROSPERO CRD42020178787.
32386567,The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic is wreaking havoc on society, especially health-care systems, including disrupting bariatric and metabolic surgery.
32386567,The current limitations on accessibility to non-urgent care undermine postoperative monitoring of patients who have undergone such operations.
32386567,Furthermore, like most elective surgery, new bariatric and metabolic procedures are being postponed worldwide during the pandemic.
32386567,When the outbreak abates, a backlog of people seeking these operations will exist.
32386567,Hence, surgical candidates face prolonged delays of beneficial treatment.
32386567,Because of the progressive nature of obesity and diabetes, delaying surgery increases risks for morbidity and mortality, thus requiring strategies to mitigate harm.
32386567,The risk of harm, however, varies among patients, depending on the type and severity of their comorbidities.
32386567,A triaging strategy is therefore needed.
32386567,The traditional weight-centric patient-selection criteria do not favour cases based on actual clinical needs.
32386567,In this Personal View, experts from the Diabetes Surgery Summit consensus conference series provide guidance for the management of patients while surgery is delayed and for postoperative surveillance.
32386567,We also offer a strategy to prioritise bariatric and metabolic surgery candidates on the basis of the diseases that are most likely to be ameliorated postoperatively.
32386567,Although our system will be particularly germane in the immediate future, it also provides a framework for long-term clinically meaningful prioritisation.
32386712,COVID-19 has sickened millions, killed hundreds of thousands, and disrupted daily life for citizens around the world.
32386712,Utterly devastating, COVID-19 is but the most recent pandemic to sweep the globe.
32386712,Throughout history, surgeons like Guy de Chauliac, James Lind, John Hunter, John Snow, and Walter Reed have led scientific campaigns to understand, prevent, and treat epidemics like the bubonic plague, scurvy, syphilis, cholera, and yellow fever.
32386712,We as a surgical community should herald their examples and re-focus our efforts to pioneer investigations into the coronavirus, helping elucidate the biology, understand its social effects, and provide effective treatment regimens for the disease.
32386848,The direct and indirect effects of Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic, on Italian patients with lysosomal storage disorders receiving therapy, were analyzed by a phone questionnaire.
32386848,No proved COVID-19 emerged among 102 interviewed.
32386848,No problems were reported by patients receiving oral treatments.
32386848,Forty-nine% of patients receiving enzyme replacement therapy in hospitals experienced disruptions, versus 6% of those home-treated.
32386848,The main reasons of missed infusions were fear of infection (62.9%) and re-organization of the infusion centers (37%).
32386875,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is posing insurmountable challenges to healthcare systems globally.
32386875,Cancer therapy is complex, and outcomes are centered on timing.
32386875,Many oncology societies and health ministries have issued guidelines for cancer care to enable oncologists and patients to navigate the crisis.
32386875,Lessons learned should inform care models for future pandemics.
32386911,The COVID-19 pandemic has consumed considerable resources and has impacted the delivery of cancer care.
32386911,Patients with cancer may have factors which place them at high risk for COVID 19 morbidity or mortality.
32386911,Highly immunosuppressive chemotherapy regimens and possible exposure to COVID-19 during treatment may put patients at additional risk.
32386911,The Society of Gynecologic Oncology convened an expert panel to address recommendations for best practices during this crisis to minimize risk to patients from deviations in cancer care and from COVID-19 morbidity.
32386911,An expert panel convened to develop initial consensus guidelines regarding anti-neoplastic therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic with respect to gynecologic cancer care and clinical trials.
32386911,COVID-19 poses special risks to patients who are older, have medical co-morbidities, and cancer.
32386911,In addition, this pandemic will likely strain resources, making delivery of cancer care or conduct of clinical trials unpredictable.
32386911,Recommendations are to limit visits and contact with health care facilities by using telemedicine when appropriate, and choosing regimens which require less frequent visits and which are less immunosuppressive.
32386911,Deviations will occur in clinical trials as a result of limited resources, and it is important to understand regulatory obligations to trial sponsors as well as to the IRB to ensure that clinical trial and patient safety oversight are maintained.
32386911,The ongoing crisis will strain resources needed to deliver cancer care.
32386911,When alterations to the delivery of care are mandated, efforts should be taken to minimize risks and maximize safety while approximating standard practice.
32387014,The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic comprises a total of more than 2,350,000 cases and 160,000 deaths.
32387014,The interest in anti-coronavirus drug development has been limited so far and effective methods to prevent or treat coronavirus infections in humans are still lacking.
32387014,Urgent action is needed to fight this fatal coronavirus infection by reducing the number of infected people along with the infection contagiousness and severity.
32387014,Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak several weeks ago, we observe in GHU PARIS Psychiatrie &amp; Neurosciences (Sainte-Anne hospital, Paris, France) a lower prevalence of symptomatic and severe forms of COVID-19 infections in psychiatric patients (∼4%) compared to health care professionals (∼14%).
32387014,Similar observations have been noted in other psychiatric units in France and abroad.
32387014,Our hypothesis is that psychiatric patients could be protected from severe forms of COVID-19 by their psychotropic treatments.
32387014,Chlorpromazine (CPZ) is a phenothiazine derivative widely used in clinical routine in the treatment of acute and chronic psychoses.
32387014,This first antipsychotic medication has been discovered in 1952 by Jean Delay and Pierre Deniker at Sainte-Anne hospital.
32387014,In addition, to its antipsychotic effects, several in vitro studies have also demonstrated a CPZ antiviral activity via the inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis.
32387014,Recently, independent studies revealed that CPZ is an anti-MERS-CoV and an anti-SARS-CoV-1 drug.
32387014,In comparison to other antiviral drugs, the main advantages of CPZ lie in its biodistribution: (i) preclinical and clinical studies have reported a high CPZ concentration in the lungs (20-200 times higher than in plasma), which is critical because of the respiratory tropism of SARS-CoV-2; (ii) CPZ is highly concentrated in saliva (30-100 times higher than in plasma) and could therefore reduce the contagiousness of COVID-19; (iii) CPZ can cross the blood-brain barrier and could therefore prevent the neurological forms of COVID-19.
32387014,Our hypothesis is that CPZ could decrease the unfavorable evolution of COVID-19 infection in oxygen-requiring patients without the need for intensive care, but also reduce the contagiousness of SARS-CoV-2.
32387014,At this end, we designed a pilot, phase III, multicenter, single blind, randomized controlled clinical trial.
32387014,Efficacy of CPZ will be assessed according to clinical, biological and radiological criteria.
32387014,The main objective is to demonstrate a shorter time to response (TTR) to treatment in the CPZ+standard-of-care (CPZ+SOC) group, compared to the SOC group.
32387014,Response to treatment is defined by a reduction of at least one level of severity on the WHO-Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement (WHO-OSCI).
32387014,The secondary objectives are to demonstrate in the CPZ+SOC group, compared to the SOC group: (A) superior clinical improvement; (B) a greater decrease in the biological markers of viral attack by SARS-CoV-2 (PCR, viral load); (C) a greater decrease in inflammatory markers (e.g.
32387014,CRP and lymphopenia); (D) a greater decrease in parenchymal involvement (chest CT) on the seventh day post-randomization; (E) to define the optimal dosage of CPZ and its tolerance; (F) to evaluate the biological parameters of response to treatment, in particular the involvement of inflammatory cytokines.
32387014,Patient recruitment along with the main and secondary objectives are in line with WHO 2020 COVID-19 guidelines.
32387014,This repositioning of CPZ as an anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug offers an alternative and rapid strategy to alleviate the virus propagation and the infection severity and lethality.
32387014,This CPZ repositioning strategy also avoids numerous developmental and experimental steps and can save precious time to rapidly establish an anti-COVID-19 therapy with well-known, limited and easy to manage side effects.
32387014,Indeed, CPZ is an FDA-approved drug with an excellent tolerance profile, prescribed for around 70 years in psychiatry but also in clinical routine in nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, in advanced cancer and also to treat headaches in various neurological conditions.
32387014,The broad spectrum of CPZ treatment - including antipsychotic, anxiolytic, antiemetic, antiviral, immunomodulatory effects along with inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis and modulation of blood-brain barrier - is in line with the historical French commercial name for CPZ, i.e.
32387014,LARGACTIL, chosen as a reference to its &quot;LARGe ACTion&quot; properties.
32387014,The discovery of those CPZ properties, as for many other molecules in psychiatry, is both the result of serendipity and careful clinical observations.
32387014,Using this approach, the field of mental illness could provide innovative therapeutic approaches to fight SARS-CoV-2.
32387040,COVID-19 is a devastating global pandemic around the world.
32387040,While the majority of infected cases appear mild, in some cases individuals present respiratory complications with possible serious lung damage.
32387040,There are no specific treatments for COVID-19 as yet, though a number are under evaluation, including experimental antivirals.
32387040,Sofosbuvir, the clinically approved anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) drug, is also capable of suppressing other families of positive-strand RNA viruses; Flaviviridae and Togaviridae.
32387040,Coronaviruses are a family of positive-strand RNA viruses with conserved polymerase, so SARS-CoV-2 RdRp is very likely to be effectively inhibited by sofosbuvir.
32387040,More importantly, sofosbuvir is safe and well tolerated at 400 mg daily in a 24 week therapeutic regimen.
32387040,Sofosbuvir active metabolite, however, shows an extremely high intracellular stability So, it is hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 infection could also be susceptible to sofosbuvir and we were convinced to design and run a clinical trial to evaluate the effect of sofosbuvir 400 mg (in combination with velpatasvir 100 mg, as add-on treatment, in addition to standard of care) on the COVID-19.
32387040,However, we believe that this manuscript/correspondence should be made available to the international scientific community as soon as possible, with the help of this esteemed journal.
32387041,A TV debate in April 2020 between two French doctors regarding the benefits of testing a coronavirus vaccine in Africa where there are no masks or treatments available has led to international criticism.
32387041,This case highlights a problematic ethical double standard in multinational clinical research: trials that would be considered unethical in high income countries (e.g., placebo-controlled where there is an existing treatment) are nonetheless justified in low-and-middle-income countries because the existing standards of care are less (i.e., no access to a treatment).
32387041,Underlying this ethical double standard in some multinational clinical trials is a moral imperialism and persistent colonialist thinking that must be rejected.
32387058,The Covid-19 pandemic is profoundly changing the organization of healthcare access.
32387058,This is particularly so for peritoneal neoplastic diseases, for which curative treatment mobilizes substantial personnel, operating room and intensive care resources.
32387058,The BIG-RENAPE and RENAPE groups have made tentative proposals for prioritizing care provision.
32387058,A tightening of the usual selection criteria is needed for curative care: young patients with few or no comorbidities and limited peritoneal extension.
32387058,It is desirable to prioritize disease conditions for which cytoreduction surgery with or without associated hyperthermic intraoperative peritoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) is the gold-standard treatment, and for which systemic chemotherapy cannot be a temporary or long-term alternative: pseudomyxoma peritonei, resectable malignant peritoneal mesotheliomas, peritoneal metastases of colorectal origin if they are resectable and unresponsive to systemic chemotherapy after up to 12 courses, first-line ovarian carcinomatosis if resectable or in interval surgery after at most six courses of systemic chemotherapy.
32387058,Addition of HIPEC must be discussed case by case in an expert center.
32387058,The prioritization of indications must consider local conditions and the phase of the epidemic to allow optimal peri-operative care.
32387061,Since the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 infection, many recommendations have been made.
32387061,However, the very nature of acute lymphoblastic leukemias and their treatment in children and adolescents led the Leukemia Committee of the French Society for the fight against cancers and leukemias in children and adolescents (SFCE) to propose more specific recommendations, even if data for this population are still scarce.
32387061,They may have to evolve according to the rapid evolution of knowledge on COVID-19.
32387139,The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has put significant strain on all aspects of health care delivery, including palliative care services.
32387139,Given the high mortality from this disease, particularly in the more vulnerable members of society, it is important to examine how best to deliver a high standard of end-of-life care during this crisis.
32387139,This case series collected data from two acute hospitals examining the management of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who subsequently died (n = 36) and compared this with national and local end-of-life audit data for all other deaths.
32387139,Our results demonstrated a shorter dying phase (38.25 hours vs. 74 hours) and higher rates of syringe driver use (72% vs. 33% in local audits), although with similar average mediation doses.
32387139,Of note was the significant heterogeneity in the phenotype of deterioration in the dying phase, two distinct patterns emerged, with one group demonstrating severe illness with a short interval between symptom onset and death and another group presenting with a more protracted deterioration.
32387139,This brief report suggests a spectrum of mode of dying.
32387139,Overall, the cohort reflects previously described experiences, with increased frailty (median Clinical Frailty Scale score of 5) and extensive comorbidity burden.
32387139,This brief report provides clinicians with a contemporaneous overview of our experience, knowledge, and pattern recognition when caring for people with COVID-19 and highlights the value of proactive identification of patients and risk of deterioration and palliation.
32387230,The world has faced an unprecedented challenge when coronavirus (COVID-19) emerged as a pandemic.
32387230,Millions of people have contracted the virus and a significant number of them lost their lives, resulting in a tremendous social and economic shock across the globe.
32387230,Amid the growing burden of the pandemic, there are parallel emergencies that need to be simultaneously tackled: the proliferation of fake medicines, fake news and medication misinformation surrounding COVID-19.
32387230,Pharmacists are key health professionals with the required skills and training to contribute to the fight against these emergencies.
32387230,Primarily, they can be a relevant source of accurate and reliable information to the public or other fellow health professionals thereby reducing the spread of COVID-19 medication misinformation.
32387230,This can be achieved by providing accurate and reliable information based on recommendations given by relevant health authorities and professional associations to make sure the community understand the importance of the message and thus minimise the detrimental consequences of the pandemic.
32387230,This commentary aims to summarise the existing literature in relation to the promising treatments currently under trial, the perils of falsified medications and medicine-related information and the role of pharmacists in taking a leading role in combating these parallel global emergencies.
32387246,Human coronavirus-associated myocarditis is known, and a number of COVID-19-related myocarditis cases have been reported.
32387246,The pathophysiology of COVID-19-related myocarditis is thought to be a combination of direct viral injury and cardiac damage due to the host's immune response.
32387246,COVID-19 myocarditis diagnosis should be guided by insights from previous coronavirus and other myocarditis experience.
32387246,The clinical findings include changes in ECG, cardiac biomarkers, and impaired cardiac function.
32387246,When cardiac MRI is infeasible, cardiac CT angiography with delayed myocardial imaging may serve to exclude significant coronary artery disease and identify myocardial inflammatory patterns.
32387246,Because many COVID-19 patients have cardiovascular comorbidities, myocardial infarction should be considered.
32387246,Where the diagnosis remains uncertain, an endomyocardial biopsy may help identify active cardiac infection through viral genome amplification and possibly refine the treatment risks of systemic immunosuppression.
32387246,Arrhythmias are not uncommon in the COVID-19 patients; however, its pathophysiology is still speculative.
32387246,Nevertheless, clinicians should be vigilant to provide prompt monitoring and treatments.
32387246,The long-term impact of COVID-19 myocarditis, including in the majority of mild cases remains unknown.
32387247,Many of the drugs being used in the treatment of the ongoing pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are associated with QT prolongation.
32387247,Expert guidance supports ECG monitoring to optimize patient safety.
32387247,To establish an enhanced process for ECG monitoring of patients being treated for COVID-19.
32387247,We created an SBAR (Situation Background Assessment Recommendation Tool) identifying the indication for ECGs in COVID-19 patients, and tagged these ECGs to ensure prompt over reading and identification of those with QT prolongation (QTc &gt;470 ms for QRS &lt; 120 ms, QTc &gt; 500 ms for QRS &gt; 120 ms).
32387247,This triggered a phone call from the electrophysiology service to the primary team to provide management guidance and a formal consultation if requested.
32387247,During a 2-week period we reviewed 2006 ECGs, corresponding to 524 unique patients, of whom 103 (19.7%) met SBAR defined criteria for QT prolongation.
32387247,When compared to those without QT prolongation, these patients were more often in the intensive care unit (58.3% vs 35.4%) and more likely to be intubated (31.1 vs 18.1%).
32387247,Fifty patients with QT prolongation (48.5%) had electrolyte abnormalities, 98 (95.1%) were on COVID-19 related QT prolonging medications, and 62 (60.2%) were on 1-4 additional non COVID-19 related QT prolonging drugs.
32387247,Electrophysiology recommendations were given to limit modifiable risk factors.
32387247,No patient developed torsade de pointes.
32387247,This process functioned efficiently, identified a high percentage of patients with QT prolongation, and led to relevant interventions.
32387247,Arrhythmias were rare.
32387247,No patient developed torsade de pointes.
32387301,COVID-19 is a medical emergency, with 20 % of patients presenting with severe clinical manifestations.
32387301,From the pathogenetic point of view, COVID-19 mimics two other well-known diseases characterized by cytokine storm and hyper-activation of the immune response, with consequent organ damage: acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) and macrophage activation syndrome (MAS).
32387301,Hematologists are confident with these situations requiring a prompt therapeutic approach for switching off the uncontrolled cytokine release; here, we discuss pros and cons of drugs that are already employed in hematology in the light of their possible application in COVID-19.
32387301,The most promising drugs might be: Ruxolitinib, a JAK1/2 inhibitor, with a rapid and powerful anti-cytokine effect, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), with their good anti-inflammatory properties, and perhaps the anti-Cd26 antibody Begelomab.
32387301,We also present immunological data from gene expression experiments where TKIs resulted effective anti-inflammatory and pro-immune drugs.
32387301,A possible combined treatment algorithm for COVID-19 is here proposed.
32387320,No therapy has yet proven effective in COVID-19.
32387320,Tocilizumab (TCZ) in patients with severe COVID-19 could be an effective treatment.
32387320,We conducted a retrospective case-control study in the Nord Franche-Comté Hospital, France.
32387320,We compared the outcome of patients treated with TCZ and patients without TCZ considering a combined primary endpoint: death and/or ICU admissions.
32387320,Patients with TCZ (n=20) had a higher Charlson comorbidity index (5.3 [±2.4] vs 3.4 [±2.6], P=0.014), presented with more severe forms (higher level of oxygen therapy at 13L/min vs 6L/min, P&lt;0.001), and had poorer biological findings (severe lymphopenia: 676/mm<sup>3</sup> vs 914/mm<sup>3</sup>, P=0.037 and higher CRP level: 158mg/L vs 105mg/L, P=0.017) than patients without TCZ (n=25).
32387320,However, death and/or ICU admissions were higher in patients without TCZ than in the TCZ group (72% vs 25%, P=0.002).
32387320,Despite the small sample size and retrospective nature of the work, this result strongly suggests that TCZ may reduce the number of ICU admissions and/or mortality in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.
32387332,A novel coronavirus, designated as SARS-CoV-2, first emerged in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, in late December 2019.
32387332,The rapidly increasing number of cases has caused worldwide panic.
32387332,In this review, we describe some currently applied diagnostic approaches, as well as therapeutics and vaccines, to prevent, treat and control further outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32387333,The nasal cavity and turbinates play important physiological functions by filtering, warming and humidifying inhaled air.
32387333,Paranasal sinuses continually produce nitric oxide (NO), a reactive oxygen species that diffuses to the bronchi and lungs to produce bronchodilatory and vasodilatory effects.
32387333,Studies indicate that NO may also help to reduce respiratory tract infection by inactivating viruses and inhibiting their replication in epithelial cells.
32387333,In view of the pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), clinical trials have been designed to examine the effects of inhaled nitric oxide in COVID-19 subjects.
32387333,We discuss here additional lifestyle factors such as mouth breathing which may affect the antiviral response against SARS-CoV-2 by bypassing the filtering effect of the nose and by decreasing NO levels in the airways.
32387333,Simple devices that promote nasal breathing during sleep may help prevent the common cold, suggesting potential benefits against coronavirus infection.
32387333,In the absence of effective treatments against COVID-19, the alternative strategies proposed here should be considered and studied in more detail.
32387389,The recent epidemic outbreak of a novel human coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2 and causing the respiratory tract disease COVID-19 has reached worldwide resonance and a global effort is being undertaken to characterize the molecular features and evolutionary origins of this virus.
32387389,Therefore, rapid and accurate identification of pathogenic viruses plays a vital role in selecting appropriate treatments, saving people's lives and preventing epidemics.
32387389,Additionally, general treatments, coronavirus-specific treatments, and antiviral treatments useful in fighting COVID-19 are addressed.
32387389,This review sets out to shed light on the SARS-CoV-2 and host receptor recognition, a crucial factor for successful virus infection and taking immune-informatics approaches to identify B- and T-cell epitopes for surface glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2.
32387389,A variety of improved or new approaches also have been developed.
32387389,It is anticipated that this will assist researchers and clinicians in developing better techniques for timely and effective detection of coronavirus infection.
32387389,Moreover, the genomic sequence of the virus responsible for COVID-19, as well as the experimentally determined three-dimensional structure of the Main protease (Mpro) is available.
32387389,The reported structure of the target Mpro was described in this review to identify potential drugs for COVID-19 using virtual high throughput screening.
32387409,In France, the combination hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin (AZ) is used in the treatment of COVID-19.
32387409,We retrospectively report on 1061 SARS-CoV-2 positive tested patients treated for at least three days with the following regimen: HCQ (200 mg three times daily for ten days) + AZ (500 mg on day 1 followed by 250 mg daily for the next four days).
32387409,Outcomes were death, clinical worsening (transfer to ICU, and &gt;10 day hospitalization) and viral shedding persistence (&gt;10 days).
32387409,A total of 1061 patients were included in this analysis (46.4% male, mean age 43.6 years - range 14-95 years).
32387409,Good clinical outcome and virological cure were obtained in 973 patients within 10 days (91.7%).
32387409,Prolonged viral carriage was observed in 47 patients (4.4%) and was associated to a higher viral load at diagnosis (p &lt; .001) but viral culture was negative at day 10.
32387409,All but one, were PCR-cleared at day 15.
32387409,A poor clinical outcome (PClinO) was observed for 46 patients (4.3%) and 8 died (0.75%) (74-95 years old).
32387409,All deaths resulted from respiratory failure and not from cardiac toxicity.
32387409,Five patients are still hospitalized (98.7% of patients cured so far).
32387409,PClinO was associated with older age (OR 1.11), severity of illness at admission (OR 10.05) and low HCQ serum concentration.
32387409,PClinO was independently associated with the use of selective beta-blocking agents and angiotensin II receptor blockers (p &lt; .05).
32387409,A total of 2.3% of patients reported mild adverse events (gastrointestinal or skin symptoms, headache, insomnia and transient blurred vision).
32387409,Administration of the HCQ+AZ combination before COVID-19 complications occur is safe and associated with a very low fatality rate in patients.
32387456,Cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 depends on binding of the viral spike (S) proteins to ACE2 and on S protein priming by TMPRSS2.
32387456,Inhibition of TMPRSS2 may work to block or decrease the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infections.
32387456,Intriguingly, TMPRSS2 is an androgen-regulated gene that is upregulated in prostate cancer where it supports tumor progression and is involved in a frequent genetic translocation with the ERG gene.
32387456,First- or second-generation androgen-deprivation therapies (ADTs) decrease the levels of TMPRSS2.
32387456,Here we put forward the hypothesis that ADTs may protect patients affected by prostate cancer from SARS-CoV-2 infections.
32387456,We extracted data regarding 9280 patients (4532 males) with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from 68 hospitals in Veneto, one of the Italian regions that was most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
32387456,The parameters used for each COVID-19 positive patient were gender, hospitalization, admission to intensive care unit (ICU), death, tumor diagnosis, prostate cancer diagnosis, and androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT).
32387456,There were 9280 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients in the Veneto on April 1, 2020.
32387456,Overall, males developed more severe complications, were more frequently hospitalized, and had a worse clinical outcome than females.
32387456,Considering only the Veneto male population (2.4 Million men), 0.2% and 0.3% of non-cancer and cancer patients, respectively, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.
32387456,Comparing the total number of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases, prostate cancer patients receiving ADT had a significantly lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to patients who did not receive ADT (OR 4.05; 95% CI 1.55-10.59).
32387456,A greater difference was found comparing prostate cancer patients receiving ADT to patients with any other type of cancer (OR 5.17; 95% CI 2.02-13.40).
32387456,Our data suggest that cancer patients have an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infections than non-cancer patients.
32387456,However, prostate cancer patients receiving ADT appear to be partially protected from SARS-CoV-2 infections.
32387574,Bereavement care is considered an integral component of quality end-of-life care endorsed by the palliative care movement.
32387574,However, few hospitals and health care institutions offer universal bereavement care to all families of patients who die.
32387574,The current coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has highlighted this gap and created a sense of urgency, from a public health perspective, for institutions to provide support to bereaved family members.
32387574,In this article, drawing on the palliative care and bereavement literature, we offer suggestions about how to incorporate palliative care tools and psychological strategies into bereavement care for families during this pandemic.
32387575,Section 2 of the 2019 World Health Organization (WHO) Model List of Essential Medicines includes opioid analgesics formulations commonly used for the control of pain and respiratory distress, as well as sedative and anxiolytic substances such as midazolam and diazepam.
32387575,These medicines, essential to palliative care, are regulated under the international drug control conventions overseen by United Nations (UN) specialized agencies and treaty bodies and under national drug control laws.
32387575,Those national laws and regulations directly affect bedside availability of Internationally Controlled Essential Medicines (ICEMs).
32387575,The complex interaction between national regulatory systems and global supply chains (now impacted by COVID-19 pandemic) directly affects bedside availability of ICEMs and patient care.
32387575,Despite decades of global civil society advocacy in the UN system, ICEMs have remained chronically unavailable, inaccessible and unaffordable in Lower-and-Middle Income Countries, and there are recent reports of shortages in High Income Countries as well.
32387575,The most prevalent symptoms in COVID-19 are breathlessness, cough, drowsiness, anxiety, agitation and delirium.
32387575,Frequently used medicines include opioids such as morphine or fentanyl and midazolam, all of them listed as ICEMs.
32387575,This paper describes the issues related to the lack of availability and limited access to ICEMs during the COVID-19 pandemic in both intensive and palliative care patients in countries of all income levels and makes recommendations for improving access.
32387694,The rapidly spreading Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), represents an unprecedented serious challenge to the global public health community.
32387694,The extremely rapid international spread of the disease with significant morbidity and mortality made finding possible therapeutic interventions a global priority.
32387694,While approved specific antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2 are still lacking, a large number of existing drugs are being explored as a possible treatment for COVID-19 infected patients.
32387694,Recent publications have re-examined the use of Chloroquine (CQ) and/or Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) as a potential therapeutic option for these patients.
32387694,In an attempt to explore the evidence that supports their use in COVID-19 patients, we comprehensively reviewed the previous studies which used CQ or HCQ as an antiviral treatment.
32387694,Both CQ and HCQ demonstrated promising in vitro results, however, such data have not yet been translated into meaningful in vivo studies.
32387694,While few clinical trials have suggested some beneficial effects of CQ and HCQ in COVID-19 patients, most of the reported data are still preliminary.
32387694,Given the current uncertainty, it is worth being mindful of the potential risks and strictly rationalise the use of these drugs in COVID-19 patients until further high quality randomized clinical trials are available to clarify their role in the treatment or prevention of COVID-19.
32387756,The novel coronavirus Covid-19 follows transmission route and clinical presentation of all community-acquired coronaviruses.
32387756,Instead, the rate of transmission is significative higher, with a faster spread of the virus responsible of the worldwide outbreak and a significative higher mortality rate due to the development of a severe lung injury.
32387756,Most noteworthy is the distribution of death rate among age groups.
32387756,Children and younger people are almost protected from severe clinical presentation.
32387756,Possible explanation of this phenomenon could be the ability of past vaccinations (especially tetanic, diphtheria toxoids and inactivated bacteria as pertussis) to stimulate immune system and to generate a scattered immunity against non-self antigens in transit, as coronaviruses and other community-circulating viruses and make immune system readier to develop specific immunity against Covid-19.
32387756,The first support to this hypothesis is the distribution of mortality rate during historical pandemics (&quot;Spanish flu&quot; 1918, &quot;Asian flu&quot; 1956 and &quot;the Hong Kong flu&quot; 1968) among age groups before and after the introduction of vaccines.
32387756,The immunological support to the hypothesis derives from recent studies about immunotherapy for malignancies, which propose the use of oncolytic vaccines combined with toxoids in order to exploit CD4 + memory T cell recall in supporting the ongoing anti-tumour response.
32387756,According to this hypothesis vaccine formulations (tetanus, diphtheria, Bordetella pertussis) could be re-administrate after the first contact with Covid-19, better before the development of respiratory severe illness and of course before full-blown ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome).
32387756,The CD4 + memory exploiting could help immune system to recall immunity of already know antigens against coronaviruses, avoiding or limiting &quot;lung crash&quot; until virus specific immunity develops and making it faster and prolonged.
32387756,Finally, this administration could be helpful not only in already infected patients, but also before infection.
32387756,In fact, people could have an immune system more ready when the contact with the Covid-19 will occur.
32387778,Infection with SARS-CoV-2, the etiologic agent of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, is accompanied by the shedding of the virus in stool.
32387778,Therefore, the quantification of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater affords the ability to monitor the prevalence of infections among the population via wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE).
32387778,In the current work, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was concentrated from wastewater in a catchment in Australia and viral RNA copies were enumerated using reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) resulting in two positive detections within a six day period from the same wastewater treatment plant (WWTP).
32387778,The estimated viral RNA copy numbers observed in the wastewater were then used to estimate the number of infected individuals in the catchment via Monte Carlo simulation.
32387778,Given the uncertainty and variation in the input parameters, the model estimated a median range of 171 to 1,090 infected persons in the catchment, which is in reasonable agreement with clinical observations.
32387778,This work highlights the viability of WBE for monitoring infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, in communities.
32387778,The work also draws attention to the need for further methodological and molecular assay validation for enveloped viruses in wastewater.
32388330,Diabetes mellitus is associated with a more severe course of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32388330,The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) receptor for host cell entry.
32388330,We aimed to assess the interactions between antihyperglycemic drugs and the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and their putative roles in COVID-19.
32388330,A literature search was performed using Pubmed to review the interrelationships between hyperglycemia, RAS and COVID-19, and the effects of antihyperglycemic medications.
32388330,The RAS has an essential role in glucose homeostasis and may have a role in COVID-19-induced lung injury.
32388330,Some antihyperglycemic medications modulate RAS and might hypothetically alleviate the deleterious effect of angiotensin II on lung injury.
32388330,Furthermore, most antihyperglycemic medications showed anti-inflammatory effects in animal models of lung injury.
32388330,Some antihyperglycemic medications might have protective effects against COVID-19-induced lung injury.
32388330,Early insulin therapy seems very promising in alleviating lung injury.
32388331,Diabetes mellitus is associated with poor prognosis in patients with COVID-19.
32388331,On the other hand, COVID-19 contributes to worsening of dysglycemia in people with diabetes mellitus over and above that contributed by stress hyperglycemia.
32388331,Herein, we have reviewed the two-way interactions between COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus.
32388331,We have performed an extensive literature search for articles in PubMed, EMBASE and Google Scholar databases till April 25, 2020, with the following keywords: &quot;COVID-19&quot;, &quot;SARS-CoV-2&quot;, &quot;diabetes&quot;, &quot;diabetes mellitus&quot;, &quot;SARS&quot;, &quot;infection&quot; and &quot;management of diabetes mellitus&quot; with interposition of the Boolean operator &quot;AND&quot;.
32388331,Compromised innate immunity, pro-inflammatory cytokine milieu, reduced expression of ACE2 and use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system antagonists in people with diabetes mellitus contribute to poor prognosis in COVID-19.
32388331,On the contrary, direct β-cell damage, cytokine-induced insulin resistance, hypokalemia and drugs used in the treatment of COVID-19 (like corticosteroids, lopinavir/ritonavir) can contribute to worsening of glucose control in people with diabetes mellitus.
32388331,The two-way interaction between COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus sets up a vicious cycle wherein COVID-19 leads to worsening of dysglycemia and diabetes mellitus, in turn, exacerbates the severity of COVID-19.
32388331,Thus, it is imperative that people with diabetes mellitus take all necessary precautions and ensure good glycemic control amid the ongoing pandemic.
32388333,The current global challenge of COVID-19 pandemic has surpassed the provincial, radical, conceptual, spiritual, social, and pedagogical boundaries.
32388333,Internet of Things (IoT) enabled healthcare system is useful for proper monitoring of COVID-19 patients, by employing an interconnected network.
32388333,This technology helps to increase patient satisfaction and reduces readmission rate in the hospital.
32388333,Searched the databases of Google Scholar, PubMed, SCOPUS and ResearchGate using the keywords &quot;Internet of things&quot; or &quot;IoT&quot; and &quot;COVID-19&quot;.
32388333,Further inputs are also taken from blogs and relevant reports.
32388333,IoT implementation impacts on reducing healthcare cost and improve treatment outcome of the infected patient.
32388333,Therefore, this present study based research is attempted to explore, discuss, and highlight the overall applications of the well-proven IoT philosophy by offering a perspective roadmap to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic.
32388333,Finally, twelve significant applications of IoT are identified and discussed.
32388333,It has ultimately forced the researchers, academicians, and scientists to propose some productive solutions to overcome or confront this pandemic.
32388333,IoT is helpful for an infected patient of COVID-19 to identify symptoms and provides better treatment rapidly.
32388333,It is useful for patient, physician, surgeon and hospital management system.
32388451,The novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which was identified after a recent outbreak in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, has generated a global pandemic impacting over 200 countries around the world.
32388451,Recent reports suggest that ACE2, which is the target protein to invade the host, has a ubiquitous presence in human organs, including lung parenchyma, gastrointestinal tract, nasal mucosa, renal and urinary tract, airway epithelia, lymphoid tissues, reproductive organs, vascular endothelium and neurons.
32388451,In this scenario, neurologists are particularly involved into considering even more specific therapeutic strategies according to the available data during the pandemic.
32388451,In particular, MS patients are usually receiving disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) with immunosuppressant or immunomodulatory effects, which increase the risk of infections and morbidity, compared with the general population.
32388451,Development of PML or other serious opportunistic infections during treatment with natalizumab forces to consider whether de-risking strategies are needed in this particular context and how to manage a high-efficacy treatment.
32388451,In this paper we report on a patient treated with natalizumab for relapsing MS who developed COVID-19 and recovered in a few days without complications.
32388451,After recovery natalizumab has been administered in the window of the extended interval dosing (EID), without reporting any worsening or new symptoms.
32388451,This case supports the opportunity to avoid discontinuing or delaying the retreatment over 8 weeks in patients recovered from a recent COVID-19.
32388458,Facing the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there is an urgent need to find protective or curable drugs to prevent or to stop the course of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32388458,Recent evidence accumulates that adamantanes, widely used in different neurological diseases, could be repurposed for COVID-19.
32388458,We hereby report on a questionnaire-based study performed to assess severity of COVID-19 in patients suffering from multiple sclerosis (n=10), Parkinson's disease (n=5) or cognitive impairment (n=7).
32388458,In all patients infection with SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed by rtPCR of nasopharyngeal swabs.
32388458,They were receiving treatment with either amantadine (n=15) or memantine (n=7) in stable registered doses.
32388458,All of them had two-week quarantine since documented exposure and none of them developed clinical manifestations of infectious disease.
32388458,They also did not report any significant changes in neurological status in the course of primary nervous system disease.
32388458,Above results warrant further studies on protective effects of adamantanes against COVID-19 manifestation, especially in subjects suffering from neurological disease.
32388486,The recent outbreak of COVID-19, which continues to ravage communities with high death tolls and untold psychosocial and catastrophic economic consequences, is a vivid reminder of nature's capacity to defy contemporary healthcare.
32388486,The pandemic calls for rapid mobilization of every potential clinical tool, including phototherapy-one of the most effective treatments used to reduce the impact of the 1918 &quot;Spanish influenza&quot; pandemic.
32388486,This paper cites several studies showing that phototherapy has immense potential to reduce the impact of coronavirus diseases, and offers suggested ways that the healthcare industry can integrate modern light technologies in the fight against COVID-19 and other infections.
32388486,The evidence shows that violet/blue (400-470 nm) light is antimicrobial against numerous bacteria, and that it accounts for Niels Ryberg Finsen's Nobel-winning treatment of tuberculosis.
32388486,Further evidence shows that blue light inactivates several viruses, including the common flu coronavirus, and that in experimental animals, red and near infrared light reduce respiratory disorders, similar to those complications associated with coronavirus infection.
32388486,Moreover, in patients, red light has been shown to alleviate chronic obstructive lung disease and bronchial asthma.
32388486,These findings call for urgent efforts to further explore the clinical value of light, and not wait for another pandemic to serve as a reminder.
32388486,The ubiquity of inexpensive light emitting lasers and light emitting diodes (LEDs), makes it relatively easy to develop safe low-cost light-based devices with the potential to reduce infections, sanitize equipment, hospital facilities, emergency care vehicles, homes, and the general environment as pilot studies have shown.
32388805,In the current dismal situation of the COVID-19 pandemic, effective management of patients with pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome is of vital importance.
32388805,Due to the current lack of effective pharmacological concepts, this situation has caused interest in (re)considering historical reports on the treatment of patients with low-dose radiation therapy for pneumonia.
32388805,Although these historical reports are of low-level evidence per se, hampering recommendations for decision-making in the clinical setting, they indicate effectiveness in the dose range between 0.3 and 1 Gy, similar to more recent dose concepts in the treatment of acute and chronic inflammatory/degenerative benign diseases with, e.g., a single dose per fraction of 0.5 Gy.
32388805,This concise review aims to critically review the evidence for low-dose radiation treatment of COVID-19 pneumopathy and discuss whether it is worth investigating in the present clinical situation.
32388880,Acute demyelinating inflammatory polyneuropathy (AIDP) is the most common type of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) in Europe, following several viral and bacterial infections.
32388880,Data on AIDP-patients associated with SARS-CoV-2 (coronavirus-2) infection are scarce.
32388880,We describe the case of a 54-years-old Caucasian female patient with typical clinical and electrophysiological manifestations of AIDP, who was reported positive with PCR for SARS-CoV-2, 3 weeks prior to onset of the neurological symptoms.
32388880,She did not experience a preceding fever or respiratory symptoms, but a transient loss of smell and taste.
32388880,At the admission to our neurological department, a progressive proximally pronounced paraparesis, areflexia, and sensory loss with tingling of all extremities were found, which began 10 days before.
32388880,The modified Erasmus Giullain-Barré Syndrome outcome score (mEGOS) was 3/9 at admission and 1/12 at day 7 of hospitalization.
32388880,The electrophysiological assessment proved a segmental demyelinating polyneuropathy and cerebrospinal fluid examination showed an albuminocytologic dissociation.
32388880,The neurological symptoms improved significantly during treatment with immunoglobulins.
32388880,Our case draws attention to the occurrence of GBS also in patients with COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), who did not experience respiratory or general symptoms.
32388880,It emphasizes that SARS-CoV-2 induces immunological processes, regardless from the lack of prodromic symptoms.
32388880,However, it is likely that there is a connection between the severity of the respiratory syndrome and further neurological consequences.
32388937,<b>Objective:</b> To evaluate the efficacy and safety of lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) and arbidol in the treatment of COVID-19 in the real world. <b>Methods:</b> The clinical data of 178 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 admitted to Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital were retrospectively analyzed from January 21 to February 9, 2020.
32388937,According to the patient's antiviral treatment regimen, 178 patients were divided into 4 groups including LPV/r group (59 patients), arbidol group (36 patients), combination therapy with LPV/r plus arbidol group (25 patients) and the conventional treatment group without any antiviral drugs (58 patients).
32388937,The main observation end points of the study was the negative conversion time of nucleic acid of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in pharyngeal swab. <b>Results:</b> The baseline of 4 groups before treatment was consistent and comparable.
32388937,The negative conversion time of nucleic acid of the 2019-nCoV in pharyngeal swab was (10.20 ± 3.49), (10.11 ± 4.68), (10.86 ± 4.74), (8.44 ± 3.51) days separately in the LPV/r group, the arbidol group, the combination therapy group, and the conventional treatment group without significant difference (<i>F</i> = 2.556, <i>P</i> = 0.058).
32388937,There was also no significant difference in the rate of negative conversion rate of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid, the improvement ration in clinical symptoms, and the improvement ration of pulmonary infection in the lung CT imaging (<i>P</i>&gt; 0.05).
32388937,However, a statistically significant difference was found in the proportion of deterioration changing from mild/moderate to severe/critical type at day 7 (<i>χ(2)</i> = 9.311, <i>P</i> = 0.017) as follows: the combination therapy group (24.0%, 6/25), the arbidol group ( 16.7%, 6/36), LPV/r group (5.4%, 3/56) and conventional treatment group (5.2%, 3/58).
32388937,Moreover, the frequency of adverse reactions in the three groups receiving antiviral drugs was significantly higher than that in the conventional treatment group (<i>χ(2)</i> = 14.875, <i>P</i> = 0.002). <b>Conclusions:</b> No evidences could prove that LPV/r and arbidol could shorten the negative conversion time of novel coronavirus nucleic acid in pharyngeal swab nor improve the symptoms of patients.
32388937,Furthermore, the combination usage of LPV/r and arbidol may not benefit for improving the disease.
32388937,Noteworthy, the adverse reactions of the antiviral drugs should be paid careful attention during the treatment. <b>目的：</b> 评价真实世界中洛匹那韦/利托那韦（LPV/r）及阿比多尔治疗新型冠状病毒肺炎（COVID-19）的疗效和安全性。
32388937,<b>方法：</b> 回顾性分析2020年1月20日至2月10日广州市第八人民医院收治的确诊为COVID-19的178例患者临床资料，根据患者的抗病毒治疗方案，分为LPV/r组59例、阿比多尔组36例、LPV/r与阿比多尔合用组25例及未使用任何抗病毒药物的常规治疗组58例。
32388937,主要观察终点为咽拭子新型冠状病毒核酸转阴时间。
32388937,<b>结果：</b> LPV/r组、阿比多尔组、合用组及常规治疗组患者治疗前基线情况差异无统计学意义。
32388937,咽拭子新型冠状病毒核酸转阴时间分别为（10.20±3.49）、（10.11±4.68）、（10.86±4.74）、（8.44±3.51）d，各组间差异无统计学意义（<i>F</i>=2.556，<i>P</i>=0.058），且咽拭子新型冠状病毒核酸转阴率、临床症状改善率及肺部感染影像学改善率也无明显差别（<i>P</i>&gt;0.05）。
32388937,但四组治疗7d由普通/轻型转为重型/危重型的比例存在统计学意义的差异（<i>χ(2)</i>=9.311，<i>P</i>=0.017）：合用组（24.0%，6/25），阿比多尔组（16.7%，6/36），LPV/r组（5.4%，3/56），常规治疗组（5.2%，3/58）。
32388937,使用抗病毒药物的3组患者发生不良反应的频率显著高于常规治疗组（<i>χ(2)</i>=14.875，<i>P</i>=0.002）。
32388937,<b>结论：</b> 未发现LPV/r和阿比多尔能促进COVID-19患者咽拭子病毒核酸转阴或改善症状，联用LPV/r和阿比多尔可能不利于病情改善，尤其需注意抗病毒药物的不良反应。.
32388947,The epidemiological history and clinical characteristics of 7 cases of COVID-19 and 1 case of close contact in the first family aggregation epidemic of COVID-19 in Gansu Province were analyzed.
32388947,The first patient A developed on January 22, 2020, with a history of residence in Wuhan, and confirmed severe cases of NCP on January 24, 2020; patient B, on January 23, 2020, diagnosed on January 31, severe cases; patient C, asymptomatic, diagnosed on January 27; patient D, asymptomatic, diagnosed on January 27; patient E, on January 24, diagnosed on January 28; patient F, asymptomatic, diagnosed on January 31; Patient G was asymptomatic and was diagnosed on January 31.
32388947,In close contact, H was asymptomatic, PCR test was negative and asymptomatic, and he was discharged early.
32388947,Among the 7 patients, 1 case died of (B) aggravation, and the other patients' condition was effectively controlled after active treatment.
32388947,Except for the discharged cases, 5 cases were positive for COVID-19 specific IgM antibody and 1 case was negative.
32388947,In this clustering outbreak, 4 patients remained asymptomatic, but PCR and IgM antibodies were positive, indicating that asymptomatic patients may be the key point to control the epidemic.
32388947,Specific IgM antibody screening for patients whose pharyngeal swab nucleic acid test is negative but with ground glass-like lung lesions is very important for early detection and early isolation.
32388947,分析甘肃省首起新型冠状病毒肺炎（COVID-19）家族聚集性疫情中7例COVID-19患者及1例密切接触者的流行病学史及临床特征。
32388947,首例患者A于2020年1月22日发病，有武汉居留史，1月24日确诊COVID-19重症病例；患者B，2020年1月23日发病，1月31日确诊，重症病例；患者C无症状，1月27日确诊；患者D无症状，1月27日确诊；患者E，1月24日发病，1月28日确诊；患者F无症状，1月31日确诊；患者G无症状，1月31日确诊；密切接触者H无症状，PCR连续检测阴性，无症状，提前出院。
32388947,7例患者中，1例（B）加重死亡，其他患者经过积极救治，病情均得到有效控制。
32388947,除了出院病例外，有5例COVID-19特异IgM抗体检测阳性，1例检测阴性。
32388947,此次聚集性暴发，4例患者始终无症状，但PCR和IgM抗体检测阳性，说明无症状者可能是此次控制疫情的关键节点，对于咽拭子核酸检测阴性但明确有毛玻璃样肺部病变的患者进行特异性IgM抗体筛查对病例早发现早隔离至关重要。.
32388976,Novel beta-coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is the pathogenic agent responsible for coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), a globally pandemic infectious disease.
32388976,Due to its high virulence and the absence of immunity among the general population, SARS-CoV-2 has quickly spread to all countries.
32388976,This pandemic highlights the urgent unmet need to expand and focus our research tools on what are considered &quot;neglected infectious diseases&quot; and to prepare for future inevitable pandemics.
32388976,This global emergency has generated unprecedented momentum and scientific efforts around the globe unifying scientists from academia, government and the pharmaceutical industry to accelerate the discovery of vaccines and treatments.
32388976,Herein, we shed light on the virus structure and life cycle and the potential therapeutic targets in SARS-CoV-2 and briefly refer to both active and passive immunization modalities, drug repurposing focused on speed to market, and novel agents against specific viral targets as therapeutic interventions for COVID-19.
32389025,The world is suffering a respiratory pandemic disease caused by a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), commonly known as COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019).
32389025,The Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency authorization for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine as experimental treatments for COVID-19 leading to a shortage of both medications.
32389025,A literature review conducted in April 2020 shows a lack of high-quality data available, resulting in ambiguous guideline recommendations.
32389025,Decisions to use either drug should be made with careful consideration of risks versus benefits along with proper monitoring.
32389025,Because of its higher potency and better safety profile, hydroxychloroquine may be the more reasonable treatment option if treatment is initiated.
32389318,The current COVID-19 pandemic presents a substantial obstacle to cancer patient care.
32389318,Data from China as well as risk models suppose that cancer patients, particularly those on active, immunosuppressive therapies are at higher risks of severe infection from the illness.
32389318,In addition, staff illness and restructuring of services to deal with the crisis will inevitably place treatment capacities under significant strain.
32389318,These guidelines aim to expand on those provided by NHS England regarding cancer care during the coronavirus pandemic by examining the known literature and provide guidance in managing patients with urothelial and rarer urinary tract cancers.
32389318,In particular, they address the estimated risk and benefits of standard treatments and consider the alternatives in the current situation.
32389318,As a result, it is recommended that this guidance will help form a framework for shared decision making with patients.
32389318,Moreover, they do not advise a one-size-fits-all approach but recommend continual assessment of the situation with discussion within and between centres.
32389492,For the first time, faced with a crisis with an exceptional magnitude due to the COVID-19 pandemic responsible for saturation of emergency services and intensive care units, the urolithiasis committee of the French Urology Association designed the recommendations for care and treatment of stone-forming patients and their treatment during crisis.
32389518,The recent appearance of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus pandemic has had a significant impact on the general population.
32389518,Patients on renal replacement therapy (RRT) have not been unaware of this situation and due to their characteristics they are especially vulnerable.
32389518,We present the results of the analysis of the COVID-19 Registry of the Spanish Society of Nephrology.
32389518,The Registry began operating on March 18th, 2020.
32389518,It collects epidemiological variables, contagion and diagnosis data, signs and symptoms, treatments and outcomes.
32389518,It is an online registry.
32389518,Patients were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection based on the results of the PCR of the virus, carried out both in patients who had manifested compatible symptoms or had suspicious signs, as well as in those who had undergone screening after some contact acquainted with another patient.
32389518,As of April 11, the Registry had data on 868 patients, from all the Autonomous Communities.
32389518,The most represented form of RRT is in-center hemodialysis (ICH) followed by transplant patients.
32389518,Symptoms are similar to the general population.
32389518,A very high percentage (85%) required hospital admission, 8% in intensive care units.
32389518,The most used treatments were hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir-ritonavir, and steroids.
32389518,Mortality is high and reaches 23%; deceased patients were more frequently on ICH, developed pneumonia more frequently, and received less frequently lopinavir-ritonavir and steroids.
32389518,Age and pneumonia were independently associated with the risk of death.
32389518,SARS-CoV-2 infection already affects a significant number of Spanish patients on RRT, mainly those on ICH, hospitalization rates are very high and mortality is high; age and the development of pneumonia are factors associated with mortality.
32389538,Surgical tracheostomies have a role in the weaning process of COVID-19 patients treated in intensive care units.
32389538,A multidisciplinary team approach (MDT) is required for decision making.
32389538,This process is augmented by specific standard operating practices implemented by senior clinicians.
32389538,Here, we report on our early experience and outcomes with open tracheostomies in a cohort of COVID-19 patients.
32389538,We outline the criteria that guide decision making and explore the challenges faced by our intensive care colleagues in the management of these patients.
32389538,The cohort was 100% male with 90% of them having a raised Body Mass Index (BMI) and other comorbidities (hypertension and diabetes). 60% have been decannulated and have been stepped down the intensive care unit.
32389538,We recorded no surgical complications or adverse events.
32389538,The service to date has been shown to be effective, safe, largely reproducible and reflective.
32389615,The COVID-19 outbreak may profoundly impact population mental health because of exposure to substantial psychosocial stress.
32389615,An increase in incident cases of psychosis may be predicted.
32389615,Clinical advice on the management of psychosis during the outbreak needs to be based on the best available evidence.
32389615,We undertook a rapid review of the impact of epidemic and pandemics on psychosis.
32389615,Fourteen papers met inclusion criteria.
32389615,Included studies reported incident cases of psychosis in people infected with a virus of a range of 0.9% to 4%.
32389615,Psychosis diagnosis was associated with viral exposure, treatments used to manage the infection, and psychosocial stress.
32389615,Clinical management of these patients, where adherence with infection control procedures is paramount, was challenging.
32389615,Increased vigilance for psychosis symptoms in patients with COVID-19 is warranted.
32389615,How to support adherence to physical distancing requirements and engagement with services in patients with existing psychosis requires careful consideration.

32389618,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China and has spread rapidly worldwide.
32389618,We present a mild SARS-CoV-2 infection in a baby with non-productive cough and normal chest computed tomography, in whom only anal swabs tested positive by real-time PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2.
32389618,She was given atomization inhalation therapy with recombinant human interferon alfa-1b for 10 days.
32389618,Her anal swabs remained positive for eight days, whereas her throat swabs were persistently negative by real-time PCR testing.
32389618,Mild and asymptomatic cases, especially in children, might present with PCR negative pharyngeal/nasal swabs and PCR positive anal swabs.
32389618,Those patients are potential sources of infection via fecal-oral transmission for COVID-19.
32389631,Pharmacists have long been involved in public health and emergency preparedness and response (EP&amp;R), including through preventive measures such as screening, vaccinations, testing, medical and pharmaceutical countermeasures, as well as ensuring medication safety and access during natural disasters and pandemics.
32389631,Pharmacy professionals are considered essential partners in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
32389631,Community and hospital pharmacies are expanding services and hours to provide essential services, putting pharmacists and their co-workers at the frontlines for patient care and safety to improve public health.
32389631,In addition, pharmacy professionals are increasingly integrating into global, national, state and local EP&amp;R efforts, including into interprofessional teams, such as Medical Reserve Corps (MRCs).
32389631,However, lacunae exist for further integration of pharmacists into public health and safety initiatives.
32389631,There are increasing opportunities and recommendations that should be expanded upon to provide improved patient care and population health interventions, and to ensure healthcare worker and public health safety.
32389631,Develop a Pharmacy Emergency Preparedness and Response (PEPR) Framework and recommendations for pharmacy professional pathways towards full integration within public health EP&amp;R efforts (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), and enhanced recognition of pharmacists' skills, roles and contributions as integral members of the interprofessional healthcare team.
32389631,This paper draws on the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) 2003 Statement on the Role of Health-System Pharmacists in Emergency Preparedness and lessons learned from previous and current public health emergencies, such as the 2009 H1N1 pandemic and the current COVID-19 pandemic, to provide expanded guidance for pharmacists and pharmacy professionals across all practice settings in EP&amp;R.
32389631,The proposed PEPR framework also incorporates information and recommendations from The Pharmacy Organizations' Joint Policy Recommendations to Combat the COVID-19 Pandemic (March 2020), CDC-NIOSH, International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP) Guidance, health departments and emergency preparedness guidance and resources, Boards of Pharmacy, and other pharmacy professional organizations and educational institutions.
32389631,Based on methods and resources utilized in developing this proposed PEPR Framework, five key focus areas were identified, as follows: CONCLUSION: Pharmacists and pharmacy professionals have been at the frontlines in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic.
32389631,Yet, challenges remain, such as limited availability of personal protection equipment, high risk of infectious exposures inherent in healthcare professions, and legislative hurdles resulting in lack of provider status and related reimbursements.
32389631,Recommendations to enhance pharmacy's scope as public health professionals involved in EP&amp;R include targeted training and education on key framework areas and policymaking.
32389631,Pharmacy professionals should further integrate with interdisciplinary public health teams.
32389631,Additional research and dissemination on impacts and outcomes of EP&amp;R can enhance recognition of pharmacy professionals' contribution and value during public health emergencies.
32389631,The proposed PEPR Framework can be utilized to develop, implement, evaluate, and disseminate results in order to strengthen existing efforts and to establish new initiatives in EP&amp;R.
32389695,As we pen these words, the COVID-19 pandemic is having profound impacts on human society.
32389695,Based on decades of research, we know that the accompanying illness,<sup>1</sup> death,<sup>2</sup> social isolation,<sup>3</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>4</sup> and malnutrition<sup>5</sup> will have deep and lasting impacts on our children and adolescents, their families, and the communities in which they develop.
32389695,The pandemic is exposing, with terrible clarity, the disparities in human society-racism,<sup>6</sup> poverty,<sup>7</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>8</sup> domestic violence,<sup>9</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>10</sup> and child maltreatment and neglect<sup>11</sup>-and tragically will likely amplify the negative impacts that each has on child development and mental health.
32389697,Severe SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection has the potential for a high mortality rate.
32389697,In this paper, we report the results of plasmapheresis treatment in a series of severely ill patients with COVID-19-related autoimmune meningoencephalitis in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).
32389755,The COVID-19 pandemic is a devastating catastrophe to the whole world, China is the first country seriously affected.
32389755,This review shows that it is possible to stop wide-spread infection in the country and to provide good quality oncology services even during this challenging period, through concerted efforts with well-organized actions at all levels (National/Municipal, Hospital and Department).
32389755,The key strategies leading to successful impacts are summarized for sharing.
32389755,In addition to making practice changes to cope with the adverse realities, oncologists should also work together to raise pragmatic suggestions to policy makers and be strong advocates to protect our patients from the detrimental effect of delay or compromised treatment.
32389803,With the COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing barriers to the collection and transport of donor cells, it is often necessary to collect and cryopreserve grafts before initiation of transplantation conditioning.
32389803,The effect on transplantation outcomes in nonmalignant disease is unknown.
32389803,This analysis examined the effect of cryopreservation of related and unrelated donor grafts for transplantation for severe aplastic anemia in the United States during 2013 to 2019.
32389803,Included are 52 recipients of cryopreserved grafts who were matched for age, donor type, and graft type to 194 recipients who received noncryopreserved grafts.
32389803,Marginal Cox regression models were built to study the effect of cryopreservation and other risk factors associated with outcomes.
32389803,We recorded higher 1-year rates of graft failure (hazard ratio [HR], 2.26; 95% confidence interval, 1.17 to 4.35; P = .01) and of 1-year overall mortality (HR, 3.13; 95% CI, 1.60 to 6.11; P = .0008) after transplantation of cryopreserved compared with noncryopreserved grafts, with adjustment for sex, performance score, comorbidity, cytomegalovirus serostatus, and ABO blood group match.
32389803,The incidence of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease did not differ between the 2 groups.
32389803,Adjusted probabilities of 1-year survival were 73% (95% CI, 60% to 84%) in the cryopreserved graft group and 91% (95% CI, 86% to 94%) in the noncryopreserved graft group.
32389803,These data support the use of noncryopreserved grafts whenever possible in patients with severe aplastic anemia.
32389859,Individuals with Familial Hypercholesterolaemia (FH) are at very high risk of cardiovascular disease, which is associated with poor outcomes from coronavirus infections.
32389859,COVID-19 puts strain on healthcare systems and may impair access to routine FH services.
32389859,On behalf of the International Lipid Expert Panel (ILEP) and the European FH Patient Network (FH Europe), we present brief recommendations on the management of adult patients with FH during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32389859,We discuss the implications of COVID-19 infections for FH patients, the importance of continuing lipid-lowering therapy where possible, issues relating to safety monitoring and service delivery.
32389859,We summarise the evidence for additional benefits of statins and other lipid-lowering drugs during viral infections.
32389859,The recommendations do not override in any way the individual responsibility of physicians to make appropriate and accurate decisions taking into account the condition of a given patient and the doses, rules, and regulations applicable to drugs and devices at the time of their prescription/use.
32389891,The main route of transmission of the human coronaviruses (HCoVs), and presumably also of the new pandemic SARS-CoV-2, is via droplets and close contacts, however their fecal elimination also suggests the possible spread via water.
32389891,A scientific literature search was thus carried out to highlight the current state of the art and knowledge gaps regarding coronavirus in water.
32389891,Since 1978 only 22 studies have met the inclusion criteria, and considered heterogeneous purposes, detection methods and types of water.
32389891,In vitro experiments have addressed the recovery efficiency of analytical methods, survival in different types of water and the removal efficiency of water treatments.
32389891,Field studies have monitored coronaviruses in surface waters, sewage, slurry, and biosolids.
32389891,Overall, at the lab scale, HCoVs or surrogates can survive for several days at 4 °C, however their persistence is lower compared with non-enveloped viruses and is strongly influenced by temperature and organic or microbial pollution.
32389891,HCoVs have rarely been detected in field investigations, however may be due to the low recovery efficiency of the analytical methods.
32389891,The scarcity of information on HCoV in the environment suggests that research is needed to understand the fate of these viruses in the water cycle.
32389940,Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) has become a pandemic around the world.
32389940,With the explosive growth of confirmed cases, emergency medical supplies are facing global shortage, which restricts the treatment of seriously ill patients and protection of medical staff.
32389940,Taking China, the United States, Australia, and Canada as examples, this study compares and analyzes the reserve and supply systems of emergency medical supplies and problems exposed in response to the COVID-19 epidemic.
32389940,Some common problems were found, such as insufficient types and quantities of emergency medical supplies in reserve, insufficient emergency production capacity, and imperfect command mechanism for emergency supplies deployment and transportation.
32389940,A sound reserve system of emergency medical supplies is the basis and guarantee for dealing with public health emergencies such as major outbreaks.
32389940,Based on the comparison of systems and practical experience, countries around the world should further improve the reserve and supply system of emergency medical supplies, and improve the coordination and cooperation mechanism for emergency supplies for international public health emergencies, so as to cope with increasingly severe public health emergencies in the context of globalization.
32390367,Although some information on the epidemiology of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and a few selected cases has been reported, data on the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients hospitalized therewith in South Korea are lacking.
32390367,We conducted a retrospective single-center study of 98 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at Yeungnam University Medical Center in Daegu, South Korea.
32390367,Sixty patients were women (61.2%), and the mean age was 55.4±17.1 years.
32390367,Thirteen patients (13.3%) were treated in the intensive care unit (ICU).
32390367,The mean interval from symptom onset to hospitalization was 7.7±4.5 days.
32390367,Patients who received ICU care were significantly older and were more likely to have diabetes mellitus.
32390367,The National Early Warning Score on the day of admission was significantly higher in patients requiring ICU care.
32390367,Acute respiratory distress syndrome (13/13 patients; 100%), septic shock (9/13; 69.2%), acute cardiac injury (9/13; 69.2%), and acute kidney injury (8/13; 61.5%) were more common in patients who received ICU care.
32390367,All patients received antibiotic therapy, and most (97/98 patients; 99.0%) received antiviral therapy (lopinavir/ritonavir).
32390367,Hydroxychloroquine was used in 79 patients (80.6%), and glucocorticoid therapy was used in 18 patients (18.4%).
32390367,In complete blood counts, lymphopenia was the most common finding (40/98 patients; 40.8%).
32390367,Levels of all proinflammatory cytokines were significantly higher in ICU patients.
32390367,As of March 29, 2020, the mortality rate was 5.1%.
32390367,Here, we report the clinical characteristics and laboratory findings of SARS-CoV-2 patients in South Korea up to March 29, 2020.
32390931,We report a case of a 75-year-old woman diagnosed with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) complicated by acute cerebral infarction.
32390931,The patient was admitted to our hospital on 5 February 2020 with severe COVID-19.
32390931,On 20 February 2020, she was diagnosed with concomitant acute cerebral infarction <i>via</i> head computed tomography (CT) and deep vein thrombosis in both lower limbs.
32390931,After symptomatic and supportive treatments, the patient was discharged on 13 March 2020.
32390931,She will comply with quarantine for another 2 weeks and receive rehabilitation training from a specialist doctor.
32390931,Cerebral infarction should be considered and promptly managed in patients with COVID-19.
32390971,Emerging coronaviruses (CoV) are constant global public health threats to society.
32390971,Multiple ongoing clinical trials for vaccines and antivirals against CoVs showcase the availability of medical interventions to both prevent and treat the future emergence of highly pathogenic CoVs in human.
32390971,However, given the diverse nature of CoVs and our close interactions with wild, domestic and companion animals, the next epidemic zoonotic CoV could resist the existing vaccines and antivirals developed, which are primarily focused on Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS CoV).
32390971,In late 2019, the novel CoV (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China, causing global public health concern.
32390971,In this review, we will summarize the key advancements of current vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV as well as discuss the challenge and opportunity in the current SARS-CoV-2 crisis.
32390971,At the end, we advocate the development of a &quot;plug-and-play&quot; platform technologies that could allow quick manufacturing and administration of broad-spectrum countermeasures in an outbreak setting.
32390971,We will discuss the potential of AAV-based gene therapy technology for <i>in vivo</i> therapeutic antibody delivery to combat SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and the future emergence of severe CoVs.
32391169,Antihypertensive drugs are one of the most widely used pharmacologic agent in the world and it is predominantly used in the elderly subjects.
32391169,Pneumonia is the most common cause of death in the extremely old subject.
32391169,During infection and its complication such as sepsis, hypotension could be exacerbated by antihypertensive drugs because homeostasis mechanisms such as sodium balance, renin angiotensin aldosterone system and/or sympathetic nervous system can be mitigated by antihypertensive drug therapy.
32391169,Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-1 and 2 viral surface protein is known to attach angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the cell membrane to facilitate viral entry into the cytoplasm.
32391169,Despite the theoretical concerns of increased ACE2 expression by Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone system (RAS) blockade, there is no evidence that RAS inhibitors are harmful during COVID-19 infection and have in fact been shown to be beneficial in animal studies.
32391169,Therefore, it is recommended to maintain RAS blockade during the current corona virus pandemic.
32391234,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus that has spread rapidly, resulting in a worldwide pandemic.
32391234,Even though end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients are particularly susceptible to COVID-19 infection and can develop severe to critical disease, there are limited studies and case reports about COVID-19 in ESRD patients.
32391234,We report a case of a 63-year-old gentleman with ESRD on regular hemodialysis.
32391234,We describe the clinical presentation of this patient, the diagnostic process, the laboratory and imaging investigations, as well as the course of treatment.
32391234,He positively responded to a 14-day course of Lopinavir-Ritonavir, Ribavirin, Azithromycin, and Hydroxychloroquine.
32391242,Precision medicine (PM) represents a new paradigm in disease diagnosis, prevention, and treatment.
32391242,To apply PM premises in an emerging coronavirus pandemic acquires potentially greater relevance in order to allow the selection of specific preventive measures as well as biomarkers that will be useful in disease management.
32391242,The identification of the new coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as the responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had led to a plethora of strategies to contain viral dissemination, affecting life styles and personal behaviors.
32391242,Viral genomic sequencing has shown that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) found on ciliated epithelial cells of the human lungs as its specific receptor.
32391242,Neutralizing antibodies to the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein were detected in patients recovered from COVID-19; however, both T cells and NK cells were reduced in severe cases.
32391242,Excessive and uncontrolled releases of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1B, IL-1RA, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, fibroblast growth factor (FGF), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and tumor necrosis factor (TNFα) were increased in severe patients.
32391242,These cytokines might be useful biomarkers of disease worsening and potential targets for new biological therapies currently under investigation.
32391242,Present knowledge and recent developments in PM approach to COVID-19 disease prevention, evaluation, and management are pointed out.
32391242,Better understanding of pathogenic pathways together with an accurate phenotype classification of patients presented with SARS-CoV-2 infection and symptoms might contribute to a more accurate definition of biomarkers and other diagnostic tools, which may lead to more precise mitigation strategies, personalized pharmacologic options, as well as new biological therapy developments.
32391282,A novel coronavirus causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), named SARS-CoV-2, was identified at the end of 2019.
32391282,The spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has progressively expanded from China, involving several countries throughout the world, leading to the classification of the disease as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO).
32391282,According to published reports, COVID-19 severity and mortality are higher in elderly patients and those with active comorbidities.
32391282,In particular, lung cancer patients were reported to be at high risk of pulmonary complications related to SARS-CoV2 infection.
32391282,Therefore, the management of cancer care during the COVID-19 pandemic is a crucial issue, to which national and international oncology organizations have replied with recommendations concerning patients receiving anticancer treatments, delaying follow-up visits and limiting caregiver admission to the hospitals.
32391282,In this historical moment, medical oncologists are required to consider the possibility to delay active treatment administration based on a case-by-case risk/benefit evaluation.
32391282,Potential risks associated with COVID-19 infection should be considered, considering tumor histology and natural course, disease setting, clinical conditions, and disease burden, together with the expected benefit, toxicities (e.g., myelosuppression or interstitial lung disease), and response obtained from the planned or ongoing treatment.
32391282,In this study, we report the results of proactive measures including social media, telemedicine, and telephone triage for screening patients with lung cancer during the COVID-19 outbreak in the European Institute of Oncology (Milan, Italy).
32391282,Proactive management and containment measures, applied in a structured and daily way, has significantly aided the identification of advance patients with suspected symptoms related to COVID-19, limiting their admission to our cancer center; we have thus been more able to protect other patients from possible contamination and at the same time guarantee to the suspected patients the immediate treatment and evaluation in referral hospitals for COVID-19.
32391308,December 2019 saw a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) from China quickly spread globally.
32391308,Currently, COVID-19, defined as the new pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), has reached over 750,000 confirmed cases worldwide.
32391308,The virus began to spread in Italy from the 22nd February, and the number of related cases is still increasing.
32391308,Furthermore, given that a relevant proportion of infected people need hospitalization in Intensive Care Units, this may be a crucial issue for National Healthcare System's capacity.
32391308,WHO underlines the importance of specific disease regional estimates.
32391308,Because of this, Italy aimed to put in place proportioned and controlled measures, and to guarantee adequate funding to both increase the number of ICU beds and increase production of personal protective equipment.
32391308,Our aim is to investigate the current COVID-19 epidemiological context in Sardinia region (Italy) and to estimate the transmission parameters using a stochastic model to establish the number of infected, recovered, and deceased people expected.
32391308,Based on available data from official Italian and regional sources, we describe the distribution of infected cases during the period between 2nd and 15th March 2020.
32391308,To better reflect the actual spread of COVID-19 in Sardinia based on data from 15th March (first Sardinian declared outbreak), two Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered-Dead (SIRD) models have been developed, describing the best and worst scenarios.
32391308,We believe that our findings represent a valid contribution to better understand the epidemiological context of COVID-19 in Sardinia.
32391308,Our analysis can help health authorities and policymakers to address the right interventions to deal with the rapidly expanding health emergency.
32391369,The aim was to investigate the effectiveness of glucocorticoid therapy in patients with COVID-19.
32391369,A systematic search of the literature across nine databases was conducted from inception until 15th March 2020, following the PRISMA guidelines.
32391369,Patients with a validated diagnosis of COVID-19 and using corticosteroids were included, considering all health outcomes.
32391369,Four studies with 542 Chinese participants were included.
32391369,Two studies reported negative findings regarding the use of corticosteroids in patients with COVID-19, i.e., corticosteroids had a detrimental impact on clinical outcomes.
32391369,One study reported no significant association between the use of corticosteroids and clinical outcomes.
32391369,However, one study, on 201 participants with different stages of pneumonia due to COVID-19, found that in more severe forms, the administration of methylprednisolone significantly reduced the risk of death by 62%.
32391369,The literature to date does not fully support the routine use of corticosteroids in COVID-19, but some findings suggest that methylprednisolone could lower mortality rate in more severe forms of the condition.
32391519,The COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on healthcare systems around the world with 3.0 million infected and 208,000 resultant mortalities as of this writing.
32391519,Information regarding infection in pregnancy is still limited.
32391519,To describe the clinical course of severe and critical infection in hospitalized pregnant women with positive laboratory testing for SARS-CoV2.
32391519,This is a cohort study of pregnant women with severe or critical COVID-19 infection hospitalized at 12 US institutions between March 5, 2020 and April 20, 2020.
32391519,Severe infection was defined according to published criteria by patient reported dyspnea, respiratory rate &gt; 30 per minute, blood oxygen saturation ≤ 93% on room air, partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen &lt;300 and/or lung infiltrates &gt;50% within 24 to 48 hours on chest imaging.
32391519,Critical disease was defined by respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction or failure.
32391519,Women were excluded if they had presumed COVID-19 infection but laboratory testing was negative.
32391519,The primary outcome was median duration from hospital admission to discharge.
32391519,Secondary outcomes included need for supplemental oxygen, intubation, cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrest, death, and timing of delivery.
32391519,The clinical courses are described by the median disease day on which these outcomes occurred after the onset of symptoms.
32391519,Treatment and neonatal outcomes are also reported.
32391519,Of 64 pregnant women hospitalized with COVID-19, 44 (69%) had severe and 20 (31%) critical disease.
32391519,The following pre-existing comorbidities were observed: 25% had a pulmonary condition, 17% had cardiac disease and the mean BMI was 34 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.
32391519,Gestational age at symptom onset was at a mean 29 ±6 weeks and at hospital admission a mean of 30 ±6 weeks, on a median day of disease 7 since first symptoms.
32391519,Eighty-one percent of women were treated with hydroxychloroquine; 9% of women with severe disease and 65% of women with critical disease received remdesivir.
32391519,All women with critical disease received either prophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulation during their admission.
32391519,The median duration of hospital stay was 6 days (6 days for severe, 10.5 days for critical, <i>p</i>=0.01).
32391519,For those who required it, intubation usually occurred around day 9, and peak respiratory support for women with severe disease occurred on day 8.
32391519,In women with critical disease, prone positioning was performed in 20% of cases, the rate of ARDS was 70%, and re-intubation was necessary in 20%.
32391519,There was one case of maternal cardiac arrest, but no cases of cardiomyopathy and no maternal deaths.
32391519,Thirty-two (50%) women in this cohort delivered during their COVID-19 hospitalization (34% of severe and 85% of critical women).
32391519,Eighty-eight percent (15/17) of pregnant women with critical COVID-19 who delivered during their disease course were delivered preterm, 94% of them via cesarean; in all, 75% (15/20) of critically ill women delivered preterm.
32391519,There were no stillbirths or neonatal deaths, or cases of vertical transmission.
32391519,In hospitalized pregnant women with severe or critical COVID-19 infection, admission typically occurred about 7 days after symptom onset, and the duration of hospitalization was 6 days (6 severe versus 12 critical).
32391519,Critically ill women had a high rate of ARDS, and there was one case of cardiac arrest, but there were no cases of cardiomyopathy, or maternal mortality.
32391519,Hospitalization for severe or critical COVID-19 infection resulted in delivery during the course of infection in 50% of this cohort, usually in the third trimester.
32391519,There were no perinatal deaths in this cohort.
32391657,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a global pandemic.
32391657,All people including children are generally susceptible to COVID-19, but the condition is relatively mild for children.
32391657,The diagnosis of COVID-19 is largely based on the epidemiological evidence and clinical manifestations, and confirmed by positive detection of virus nucleic acid in respiratory samples.
32391657,The main symptoms of COVID-19 in children are fever and cough; the total number of white blood cell count is usually normal or decreased; the chest imaging is characterized by interstitial pneumonia, which is similar to other respiratory virus infections and <i>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</i> infections.
32391657,Early identification, early isolation, early diagnosis and early treatment are important for clinical management.
32391657,The treatment of mild or moderate type of child COVID-19 is mainly symptomatic.
32391657,For severe and critical ill cases, the oxygen therapy, antiviral drugs, antibacterial drugs, glucocorticoids, mechanical ventilation or even extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) may be adopted, and the treatment plan should be adjusted timely through multi-disciplinary cooperation.
32391658,The current epidemic situation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) still remained severe.
32391658,As the National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine is the primary medical care center for COVID-19 in Zhejiang province.
32391658,Based on the present expert consensus carried out by National Health Commission and National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, our team summarized and established an effective treatment strategy centered on &quot;Four-Anti and Two-Balance&quot; for clinical practice.
32391658,The &quot;Four-Anti and Two-Balance&quot; strategy included antivirus, anti-shock, anti-hyoxemia, anti-secondary infection, and maintaining of water, electrolyte and acid base balance and microecological balance.
32391658,Meanwhile, integrated multidisciplinary personalized treatment was recommended to improve therapeutic effect.
32391658,The importance of early viralogical detection, dynamic monitoring of inflammatory indexes and chest radiograph was emphasized in clinical decision-making.
32391658,Sputum was observed with the highest positive rate of RT-PCR results.
32391658,Viral nucleic acids could be detected in 10%patients' blood samples at acute period and 50%of patients had positive RT-PCR results in their feces.
32391658,We also isolated alive viral strains from feces, indicating potential infectiousness of feces.Dynamic cytokine detection was necessary to timely identifying cytokine storms and application of artificial liver blood purification system.
32391658,The &quot;Four-Anti and Two-Balance&quot; strategy effectively increased cure rate and reduced mortality.
32391658,Early antiviral treatment could alleviate disease severity and prevent illness progression, and we found lopinavir/ritonavir combined with abidol showed antiviral effects in COVID-19.
32391658,Shock and hypoxemia were usually caused by cytokine storms.
32391658,The artificial liver blood purification system could rapidly remove inflammatory mediators and block cytokine storm.Moreover, it also favored the balance of fluid, electrolyte and acid-base and thus improved treatment efficacy in critical illness.
32391658,For cases of severe illness, early and also short period of moderate glucocorticoid was supported.
32391658,Patients with oxygenation index below 200 mmHg should be transferred to intensive medical center.
32391658,Conservative oxygen therapy was preferred and noninvasive ventilation was not recommended.
32391658,Patients with mechanical ventilation should be strictly supervised with cluster ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention strategies.
32391658,Antimicrobial prophylaxis was not recommended except for patients with long course of disease, repeated fever and elevated procalcitonin (PCT), meanwhile secondary fungal infection should be concerned.Some patients with COVID-19 showed intestinal microbial dysbiosis with decreased probiotics such as <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Bifidobacterium</i>, so nutritional and gastrointestinal function should be assessed for all patients.Nutritional support and application of prebiotics or probiotics were suggested to regulate the balance of intestinal microbiota and reduce the risk of secondary infection due to bacterial translocation.
32391658,Anxiety and fear were common in patients with COVID-19.
32391658,Therefore,we established dynamic assessment and warning for psychological crisis.
32391658,We also integrated Chinese medicine in treatment to promote disease rehabilitation through classification methods of traditional Chinese medicine.
32391658,We optimized nursing process for severe patients to promote their rehabilitation.
32391658,It remained unclear about viral clearance pattern after the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.
32391658,Therefore, two weeks' quarantine for discharged patients was required and a regular following up was also needed.The Zhejiang experience and suggestions have been implemented in our center and achieved good results.
32391658,However, since COVID-19 was a newly emerging disease, more work was warranted to improve strategies of prevention, diagnosis and treatment for COVID-19.
32391659,Severe and critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were usually with underlying diseases, which led to the problems of complicated drug use, potential drug-drug interactions and medication errors in special patients.
32391659,Based on <i>Diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia</i> (<i>trial version</i> 6), and <i>Management of COVID</i>-19: <i>the Zhejiang experience</i>, we summarized the experience in the use of antiviral drugs, corticosteroids, vascular active drugs, antibacterial, probiotics, nutrition support schemes in severe and critically ill COVID-19 patients.
32391659,It is also suggested to focus on medication management for evaluation of drug efficacy and duration of treatment, prevention and treatment of adverse drug reactions, identification of potential drug-drug interactions, individualized medication monitoring based on biosafety protection, and medication administration for special patients.
32391661,To establish a SEIR epidemic dynamics model that can be used to evaluate the COVID-19 epidemic, and to predict and evaluate the COVID-19 epidemic in Hubei province using the proposed model.
32391661,COVID-19 SEIR transmission dynamics model was established, which took transmission ability in latent period and tracking quarantine interventions into consideration.
32391661,Based on the epidemic data of Hubei province from January 23, 2020 to February 24, 2020, the parameters of the newly established modified SEIR model were fitted.
32391661,By using Euler integral algorithm to solve the modified SEIR dynamics model, the epidemic situation in Hubei province was analyzed, and the impact of prevention and control measures such as quarantine and centralized treatment on the epidemic development was discussed.
32391661,The theoretical estimation of the epidemic situation by the modified SEIR epidemic dynamics model is in good agreement with the actual situation in Hubei province.
32391661,Theoretical analysis showed that prevention and control quarantine and medical follow-up quarantine played an important inhibitory effect on the outbreak of the epidemic.The centralized treatment played a key role in the rapid decline in the number of infected people.
32391661,In addition, it is suggested that individuals should improve their prevention awareness and take strict self-protection measures to curb the increase in infected people.
32391661,The modified SEIR model is reliable in the evaluation of COVID-19 epidemic in Hubei province, which provides a theoretical reference for the decision-making of epidemic interventions.
32391663,To analyze the dynamic changes of chest CT images of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32391663,Fifty-two cases of COVID-19 were admitted in the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine.
32391663,The consecutive chest CT scans were followed up for all patients with an average of 4 scans performed per patient during the hospitalization.
32391663,The shortest interval between each scan was 2 days and the longest was 7 days.
32391663,The shape, number and distribution of lung shadows, as well as the characteristics of the lesions on the CT images were reviewed.
32391663,The obvious shadows infiltrating the lungs were shown on CT images in 50 cases, for other 2 cases there was no abnormal changes in the lungs during the first CT examination.
32391663,Ground-glass opacities (GGO) were found in 48 cases (92.3%), and 19 cases (36.5%) had patchy consolidation and sub-consolidation, which were accompanied with air bronchi sign in 17 cases (32.7%).
32391663,Forty one cases (78.8%) showed a thickened leaflet interval, 4 cases (7.6%) had a small number of fibrous stripes.
32391663,During hospitalization, GGO lesions in COVID-19 patients gradually became rare,the fibrous strip shadows increased and it became the most common imaging manifestation.
32391663,The lesions rapidly progressed in 39 cases (75.0%) within 6-9 days after admission.
32391663,On days 10-14 of admission, the lesions distinctly resolved in 40 cases (76.9%).
32391663,The chest CT images of patients with COVID-19 have certain characteristics with dynamic changes, which are of value for monitoring disease progress and clinical treatment.
32391664,To investigate the CT findings of patients with different clinical types of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32391664,A total of 67 patients diagnosed as COVID-19 by nucleic acid testing were collected and divided into 4 groups according to the clinical stages based on <i>Diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia (trial version 6)</i>.
32391664,The CT imaging characteristics were analyzed among patients with different clinical types.
32391664,Among 67 patients, 3(4.5%) were mild, 35 (52.2%) were moderate, 22 (32.8%) were severe, and 7(10.4%) were critical ill.
32391664,No significant abnormality in chest CT imaging in mild patients.
32391664,The 35 cases of moderate type included 3 (8.6%) single lesions, the 22 cases of severe cases included 1 (4.5%) single lesion and the rest cases were with multiple lesions.
32391664,CT images of moderate patients were mainly manifested by solid plaque shadow and halo sign (18/35, 51.4%); while fibrous strip shadow with ground glass shadow was more frequent in severe cases (7/22, 31.8%).
32391664,Consolidation shadow as the main lesion was observed in 7 cases, and all of them were severe or critical ill patients.
32391664,CT images of patients with different clinical types of COVID-19 have characteristic manifestations, and solid shadow may predict severe and critical illness.
32391665,To explore the risk factors of anxiety and depression in patients with suspected coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) so as to achieve early intervention and better clinical prognosis.
32391665,Seventy-six patients with suspected COVID-19 in fever isolation wards of Second Hospital of Lanzhou University were enrolled From January 31, 2020 to February 22, 2020.
32391665,Their clinical baseline data were collected.
32391665,The anxiety of patients was assessed by Hamilton Anxiety Scale, and the depression of patients was assessed by Hamilton Depression Scale.
32391665,Multivariate Logistic regression analysis was performed to explore the risk factors of anxiety and depression in these patients.
32391665,Female patients are more likely to have anxiety (<i>OR</i>=3.206, 95%<i>CI</i>: 1.073-9.583, <i>P</i>&lt;0.05) and depression (<i>OR</i>=9.111, 95%<i>CI</i>: 2.143-38.729, <i>P</i>&lt;0.01) than male patients; patients with known contact history of epidemic area and personnel in epidemic area are more likely to have depression (<i>OR</i>=3.267, 95%<i>CI</i>: 1.082-9.597, <i>P</i>&lt;0.05).
32391665,During the isolation treatment of suspected COVID-19 patients, early psychological intervention should be carried out for the female patients with known contact history of epidemic area and personnel in epidemic area, and drug treatment should be given in advance if necessary.
32391666,To analyze the roles of multidisciplinary team (MDT) in the diagnosis and treatment of suspected cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32391666,The clinical data of 48 patients with suspected COVID-19 admitted in Jinhua Municipal Central Hospital from January 21, 2020 to March 20, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed.
32391666,In the 48 suspected cases, 18 were diagnosed with COVID-19, and 30 were excluded.
32391666,Each of the confirmed cases were discussed among MDT for 2 to 12 times with an average of (4.7±3.2) times; while for non-COVID-19 patients were discussed for 2 to 4 times with an average of (2.3±0.6) times.
32391666,With the guidance of MDT, one COVID-19 patient was transferred to designated provincial hospital after effective treatment; one patient complicated with acute cholecystitis underwent gallbladder puncture and drainage; and COVID-19 was excluded in a highly suspected patient after alveolar lavage fluid examination.
32391666,Except one transferred patient, all 17 confirmed COVID-19 patients were cured and discharged.
32391666,There was no cross-infection occurred in suspected patients during the hospitalization.
32391666,There were no deaths and no medical staff infections.
32391666,The efficiency of diagnosis and treatment for suspected COVID-19 patients can be improved with MDT, particularly for complicated cases.
32391667,To evaluate the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in the treatment of patients with moderate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32391667,We prospectively enrolled 30 treatment-naïve patients with confirmed COVID-19 after informed consent at Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center.
32391667,The patients were randomized 1：1 to HCQ group and the control group.
32391667,Patients in HCQ group were given HCQ 400 mg per day for 5 days plus conventional treatments, while those in the control group were given conventional treatment only.
32391667,The primary endpoint was negative conversion rate of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in respiratory pharyngeal swab on days 7 after randomization.
32391667,This study has been approved by the Ethics Committee of Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center and registered online (NCT04261517).
32391667,One patient in HCQ group developed to severe during the treatment.
32391667,On day 7, nucleic acid of throat swabs was negative in 13 (86.7%) cases in the HCQ group and 14 (93.3%) cases in the control group (<i>P</i>&gt;0.05).
32391667,The median duration from hospitalization to virus nucleic acid negative conservation was 4 (1,9) days in HCQ group, which is comparable to that in the control group [2 (1,4) days, Z=1.27, <i>P</i>&gt;0.05].
32391667,The median time for body temperature normalization in HCQ group was 1 (0,2) day after hospitalization, which was also comparable to that in the control group [1 (0,3) day].
32391667,Radiological progression was shown on CT images in 5 cases (33.3%) of the HCQ group and 7 cases (46.7%) of the control group, and all patients showed improvement in follow-up examinations.
32391667,Four cases (26.7%) of the HCQ group and 3 cases (20%) of the control group had transient diarrhea and abnormal liver function (<i>P</i>&gt;0.05).
32391667,The prognosis of COVID-19 moderate patients is good.
32391667,Larger sample size study are needed to investigate the effects of HCQ in the treatment of COVID-19.
32391667,Subsequent research should determine better endpoint and fully consider the feasibility of experiments such as sample size.
32391668,To investigate the effect of corticosteroids therapy on the inflammatory response in a critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patient.
32391668,A 55-year old female patient with critical ill COVID-19 was admitted in Taizhou Hospital on January 19, 2020.
32391668,The patient was treated with methylprednisolone 80 mg on the 2nd day after admission.
32391668,Thereafter, the dose was adjusted in a timely manner and the therapy lasted for 13 days.
32391668,The peripheral lymphocyte subsets (CD3<sup>+</sup>T, CD4<sup>+</sup> T, CD8<sup>+</sup> T, NK cells, B cells), as well as serum levels of lymphocyte factors (IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, IFN-γ) were dynamically monitored.
32391668,On D1 of admission, the numbers of peripheral blood CD3<sup>+</sup> T, CD4<sup>+</sup> T, CD8<sup>+</sup> T, and NK cells were significantly lower than the normal range.
32391668,With the improvement of the disease, the numbers of CD3<sup>+</sup> T, CD8<sup>+</sup> T and CD4 <sup>+</sup> T cells gradually recovered and showed a linear growth trend (linear fitting equation: <i>Y</i>=18.59<i>X</i>+109.4, <i>P</i>&lt;0.05).
32391668,On D2 of admission, the patient's IL-6 and IL-10 levels were significantly higher than normal values, IFN-γ was at a normal high value, and then rapidly decreased; IL-2, IL-4, and TNF-α were all in the normal range.
32391668,On the D6 and D7, the IL-6 and IL-10 decreased to the normal range for the first time.
32391668,On the D18, the sputum virus nucleic acid test was negative for the first time, and the fecal virus nucleic acid test was still positive; on the D20 the sputum and fecal virus nucleic acid test were both negative.
32391668,On D34, the patient recovered and was discharged.
32391668,At the discharge the muscle strength score of the patient was 44 and the daily life ability evaluation was 90.
32391668,In the absence of effective antiviral drugs, early use of appropriate doses of corticosteroids in critically ill patient with COVID-19 can quickly alleviate inflammatory response and improve clinical symptoms, however, it may reduce the number of T cells, and to adjust the dose in time is necessary.
32391669,To observe the clinical effect of plasma exchange and tocilizumab in treatment of patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32391669,Six patients with severe COVID-19 admitted in First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College from January 25 to February 25, 2020.
32391669,Three patients were treated with plasma exchange and three patients were treated with tocilizumab.
32391669,The effect on excessive inflammatory reaction of plasma exchange and tocilizumab was observed.
32391669,The C-reactive protein (CRP) and IL-6 levels were significantly decreased and the lymphocyte and prothrombin time were improved in 3 patients after treatment with plasma exchange; while inflammation level was not significantly decreased, and lymphocyte and prothrombin time did not improve in 3 patients treated with tocilizumab.
32391669,For severe COVID-19 patients with strong inflammatory reaction, plasma exchange may be preferred.
32391670,Acute respiratory failure due to acute hypoxemia is the major manifestation in severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32391670,Rational and effective respiratory support is crucial in the management of COVID-19 patients.
32391670,High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) has been utilized widely due to its superiority over other non-invasive respiratory support techniques.
32391670,To avoid HFNC failure and intubation delay, the key issues are proper patients, timely application and improving compliance.
32391670,It should be noted that elder patients are vulnerable for failed HFNC.
32391670,We applied HFNC for oxygen therapy in severe and critical ill COVID-19 patients and summarized the following experiences.
32391670,Firstly, to select the proper size of nasal catheter, to locate it at suitable place, and to confirm the nose and the upper respiratory airway unobstructed.
32391670,Secondly, an initial ow of 60 L/min and 37℃ should be given immediately for patients with obvious respiratory distress or weak cough ability; otherwise, low-level support should be given first and the level gradually increased.
32391670,Thirdly, to avoid hypoxia or hypoxemia, the treatment goal of HFNC should be maintained the oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) above 95% for patients without chronic pulmonary disease.
32391670,Finally, patients should wear a surgical mask during HFNC treatment to reduce the risk of virus transmission through droplets or aerosols.
32391671,To analyze the clinical characteristics and pregnancy outcomes of pregnant women complicated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32391671,The clinical data of 3 pregnant women with COVID-19 admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine from January 19 to February 10, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed.
32391671,There was one case in the first-trimester pregnancy (case 1), one in the second-trimester pregnancy (case 2) and one in third-trimester pregnancy (case 3).
32391671,Cough, fever, fatigue, lung imaging changes were the main manifestations.
32391671,The white cell count, lymphocyte percentage had no significantly changes in case 1 and case 3, while the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), IL-6 and IL-10 elevated.
32391671,The lymphocyte count and lymphocyte percentage decreased and the inflammatory indicators significantly increased in case 2.
32391671,All patients were treated with antiviral, antitussive, oxygen inhalation; case 3 received glucocorticoids, case 2 with severe illness received glucocorticoids and additionally gamma globulin.
32391671,All three cases were cured and discharged.
32391671,Case 1 with early pregnancy chose to terminate pregnancy after discharge; case 2 chose to continue pregnancy without obstetric complications; and case 3 had cesarean section delivery due to abnormal fetal heart monitoring.
32391671,The report shows that COVID-19 in pregnancy women could be cured with active treatment, and the maternal and fetal outcomes can be satisfactory.
32391672,To explore the feasibility of radical resection for cancer patients complicated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32391672,The management and clinical outcome of a sigmoid cancer patient with COVID-19 were analyzed.
32391672,The inflammation indicators and fever of this patient were effectively controlled and the lung lesions remained stable after active anti-viral treatment, then the radical colorectomy was performed after the viral negative conversion for twice.
32391672,The case indicates that radical resection can be performed in SARS-CoV-2 patients with twice-negative SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing results.
32391675,To analysis the medication characteristics of the prescriptions issued via open channel by the National and Provincial Health Committee and the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine in treating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32391675,We collected the data of traditional Chinese medicine related to treatment plans published by the National and Provincial Health Committee and the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine from the start of COVID-19 outbreak to February 19, 2020.
32391675,The frequency analysis, cluster analysis and association analysis were performed.
32391675,The study collected 4 national and 34 regional prevention and treatment plans, 578 items, 84 traditional Chinese formulations, 60 Chinese patent medicines, and 230 Chinese herbs.
32391675,The high frequently used herbs were <i>Liquorice, Scutellariabaicalensis, Semen armeniacaeamarae</i>, and <i>Gypsum</i>.
32391675,The commonly used traditional formulations included <i>Maxing Shigan</i> decoction, <i>Yin Qiao</i> powder, and <i>Xuanbai Chengqi</i> decoction.
32391675,The Chinese patent drugs included <i>Angong Niuhuang</i> pill, <i>Xuebijing</i> injection, and <i>Lianhua Qingwen</i> capsule.
32391675,The most common paired medications were <i>Ephedra</i> and <i>Semen armeniacaeamarae, Fructusforsythiae</i> and <i>Liquorice.</i> Two core combinations and one novel formula were discovered in the study. <i>Yin Qiao</i> powder and <i>Huopo Xialing</i> decoction are the basic formulations for <i>Weifen</i> syndrome of COVID-19.
32391675,In addition, <i>Maxing Shigan</i> decoction, <i>Liang Ge</i> powder, <i>Qingwen Baidu</i> decoction and <i>Da Yuan</i> decoction are the basic formulations for <i>Qifen</i> syndrome of COVID-19.
32391675,The main medication characteristics are clearing heat, entilating lung, removing toxicity and removing turbidity.
32391675,It shows that removing toxicity and eliminating evil are the prescription thought in treating epidemic disease of traditional Chinese medicine.
32391741,Background Atypical manifestations of COVID-19 are being encountered as the pandemic unfolds, leading to non-chest CT scans that may uncover unsuspected pulmonary disease.
32391741,Purpose To investigate patients with primary non-respiratory symptoms who underwent abdomen/pelvis or cervical spine/neck CT with unsuspected findings highly suspicious for pulmonary COVID-19.
32391741,Materials and Methods This retrospective study from March 10, 2020 to April 6, 2020 involved three institutions, two in a region considered a hotspot (area of high prevalence) for COVID-19.
32391741,Patients without known COVID-19 were included who presented to the emergency room (ER) with primary non-respiratory [gastrointestinal (GI) or neurological] symptoms, had lung parenchymal findings suspicious for COVID-19 on a non-chest CT but no concurrent chest CT and had COVID-19 testing in the ER.
32391741,Group 1 patients had RT PCR obtained pre-CT read (COVID-19 suspected on presentation); Group 2 had RT PCR obtained post-CT read (COVID-19 not suspected).
32391741,Presentation and imaging findings were compared and outcomes were evaluated.
32391741,Descriptive statistics and Fisher exact tests were used for analysis.
32391741,Results Group 1 comprised 62 patients [31 men, 31 women, mean age 67(SD ±17) years] and group 2 comprised 57 patients [28 men, 29 women, mean age 63(SD ± 16) years).
32391741,Cough and fever were more common in group 1 (37/62, 60%, 29/62, 47%) than group 2 (9/57, 16%, 12/57, 21%) respectively, with no significant difference in the remaining symptoms.
32391741,There were 101 abdomen/pelvis and 18 cervical spine/neck CTs.
32391741,In Group 1, non-chest CT findings provided the initial evidence of COVID-19 related pneumonia in 32/62 (52%); for Group 2, it was 44/57 (77%).
32391741,Overall, the most common CT findings were ground glass opacity (114/119, 96%) and consolidation (47/119,40%). 29/119 (24%) patients required major interventions (vasopressor medication or intubation) and 27/119 (23%) died.
32391741,Patients who underwent cervical spine/neck CT had worse outcomes than those with abdominal/pelvic CT (p =0.01).
32391741,Conclusion In a substantial percentage of patients with primary non-respiratory symptoms who underwent non-chest CT, the CT provided the first evidence of COVID-19 related pneumonia.
32391877,To investigate the characteristics and clinical significance of myocardial injury in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32391877,We enrolled 671 eligible hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 from 1 January to 23 February 2020, with a median age of 63 years.
32391877,Clinical, laboratory, and treatment data were collected and compared between patients who died and survivors.
32391877,Risk factors of death and myocardial injury were analysed using multivariable regression models.
32391877,A total of 62 patients (9.2%) died, who more often had myocardial injury (75.8% vs.
32391877,9.7%; P &lt; 0.001) than survivors.
32391877,The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of initial cardiac troponin I (cTnI) for predicting in-hospital mortality was 0.92 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.87-0.96; sensitivity, 0.86; specificity, 0.86; P &lt; 0.001].
32391877,The single cut-off point and high level of cTnI predicted risk of in-hospital death, hazard ratio (HR) was 4.56 (95% CI, 1.28-16.28; P = 0.019) and 1.25 (95% CI, 1.07-1.46; P = 0.004), respectively.
32391877,In multivariable logistic regression, senior age, comorbidities (e.g. hypertension, coronary heart disease, chronic renal failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), and high level of C-reactive protein were predictors of myocardial injury.
32391877,The risk of in-hospital death among patients with severe COVID-19 can be predicted by markers of myocardial injury, and was significantly associated with senior age, inflammatory response, and cardiovascular comorbidities.
32391999,Since the outbreak of COVID-19, chloroquine has been mentioned as a possible treatment.
32391999,In vitro studies have shown anti-viral activity of chloroquine against SARS-CoV-2.
32391999,Recently, the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment published treatment options for antiviral treatment for COVID-19 where chloroquine was suggested as first choice for off-label treatment, beside remdesivir en lopinavir/ritonavir.
32391999,In this commentary, we provide a background and history of chloroquine, the evidence for antiviral efficacy of chloroquine and the arguments for off-label use of chloroquine in COVID-19.
32392007,The current guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of primary respiratory infections are still useful during the COVID-19 epidemic.Telephone triage of patients with respiratory complaints aims to identify patients with complications or an increased risk of complications.There are no indications to test for SARS-CoV-2 virus in general practice.During this COVID-19 epidemic, protective clothing is recommended in all physical contacts with patients with respiratory complaints.There is no reason to be cautious about using NSAIDs in patients suspected of COVID-19.
32392007,Amoxicillin is first choice treatment for respiratory infections during the COVID-19 epidemic; there is lack of evidence to support azithromycin as a first choice.Respiratory rate &gt; 24 / min or saturation &lt;92-94% indicate imminent respiratory decompensation and may be reasons for referral.
32392282,Hydroxychloroquine, with or without azithromycin, has been considered as a possible therapeutic agent for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32392282,However, there are limited data on efficacy and associated adverse events.
32392282,To describe the association between use of hydroxychloroquine, with or without azithromycin, and clinical outcomes among hospital inpatients diagnosed with COVID-19.
32392282,Retrospective multicenter cohort study of patients from a random sample of all admitted patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in 25 hospitals, representing 88.2% of patients with COVID-19 in the New York metropolitan region.
32392282,Eligible patients were admitted for at least 24 hours between March 15 and 28, 2020.
32392282,Medications, preexisting conditions, clinical measures on admission, outcomes, and adverse events were abstracted from medical records.
32392282,The date of final follow-up was April 24, 2020.
32392282,Receipt of both hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine alone, azithromycin alone, or neither.
32392282,Primary outcome was in-hospital mortality.
32392282,Secondary outcomes were cardiac arrest and abnormal electrocardiogram findings (arrhythmia or QT prolongation).
32392282,Among 1438 hospitalized patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 (858 [59.7%] male, median age, 63 years), those receiving hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, or both were more likely than those not receiving either drug to have diabetes, respiratory rate &gt;22/min, abnormal chest imaging findings, O2 saturation lower than 90%, and aspartate aminotransferase greater than 40 U/L.
32392282,Overall in-hospital mortality was 20.3% (95% CI, 18.2%-22.4%).
32392282,The probability of death for patients receiving hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin was 189/735 (25.7% [95% CI, 22.3%-28.9%]), hydroxychloroquine alone, 54/271 (19.9% [95% CI, 15.2%-24.7%]), azithromycin alone, 21/211 (10.0% [95% CI, 5.9%-14.0%]), and neither drug, 28/221 (12.7% [95% CI, 8.3%-17.1%]).
32392282,In adjusted Cox proportional hazards models, compared with patients receiving neither drug, there were no significant differences in mortality for patients receiving hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin (HR, 1.35 [95% CI, 0.76-2.40]), hydroxychloroquine alone (HR, 1.08 [95% CI, 0.63-1.85]), or azithromycin alone (HR, 0.56 [95% CI, 0.26-1.21]).
32392282,In logistic models, compared with patients receiving neither drug cardiac arrest was significantly more likely in patients receiving hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin (adjusted OR, 2.13 [95% CI, 1.12-4.05]), but not hydroxychloroquine alone (adjusted OR, 1.91 [95% CI, 0.96-3.81]) or azithromycin alone (adjusted OR, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.27-1.56]), .
32392282,In adjusted logistic regression models, there were no significant differences in the relative likelihood of abnormal electrocardiogram findings.
32392282,Among patients hospitalized in metropolitan New York with COVID-19, treatment with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, or both, compared with neither treatment, was not significantly associated with differences in in-hospital mortality.
32392282,However, the interpretation of these findings may be limited by the observational design.
32392288,The recent and ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has taken an unprecedented toll on adults critically ill with COVID-19 infection.
32392288,While there is evidence that the burden of COVID-19 infection in hospitalized children is lesser than in their adult counterparts, to date, there are only limited reports describing COVID-19 in pediatric intensive care units (PICUs).
32392288,To provide an early description and characterization of COVID-19 infection in North American PICUs, focusing on mode of presentation, presence of comorbidities, severity of disease, therapeutic interventions, clinical trajectory, and early outcomes.
32392288,This cross-sectional study included children positive for COVID-19 admitted to 46 North American PICUs between March 14 and April 3, 2020. with follow-up to April 10, 2020.
32392288,Prehospital characteristics, clinical trajectory, and hospital outcomes of children admitted to PICUs with confirmed COVID-19 infection.
32392288,Of the 48 children with COVID-19 admitted to participating PICUs, 25 (52%) were male, and the median (range) age was 13 (4.2-16.6) years.
32392288,Forty patients (83%) had significant preexisting comorbidities; 35 (73%) presented with respiratory symptoms and 18 (38%) required invasive ventilation.
32392288,Eleven patients (23%) had failure of 2 or more organ systems.
32392288,Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was required for 1 patient (2%).
32392288,Targeted therapies were used in 28 patients (61%), with hydroxychloroquine being the most commonly used agent either alone (11 patients) or in combination (10 patients).
32392288,At the completion of the follow-up period, 2 patients (4%) had died and 15 (31%) were still hospitalized, with 3 still requiring ventilatory support and 1 receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.
32392288,The median (range) PICU and hospital lengths of stay for those who had been discharged were 5 (3-9) days and 7 (4-13) days, respectively.
32392288,This early report describes the burden of COVID-19 infection in North American PICUs and confirms that severe illness in children is significant but far less frequent than in adults.
32392288,Prehospital comorbidities appear to be an important factor in children.
32392288,These preliminary observations provide an important platform for larger and more extensive studies of children with COVID-19 infection.
32392333,The trajectory, and impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in sub-Saharan Africa is unclear, but it is seemingly varied between different countries, with most reporting low numbers.
32392333,We use the situation in Zimbabwe to build an argument that the epidemic is likely to be attenuated in some countries with similar socio-economic and cultural structures.
32392333,However, even an attenuated epidemic may overwhelm weak health systems, emphasising the importance of prevention.
32392333,These prevention strategies should be tailored to the unique social and cultural networks of individual countries which may facilitate the spread of SARS-CoV 2.
32392333,It is also equally important to maintain services for the major infectious diseases in the region such as tuberculosis and malaria.
32392333,A breakdown of treatment and prevention services for these conditions may even overshadow the projected morbidity and mortality from COVID-19.
32392473,The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a global pandemic that significantly impacts people living with diabetes.
32392473,Diabetes-related factors of glycemic control, medication pharmacodynamics, and insulin access can impact the severity of a COVID-19 infection.
32392473,In this commentary, we explore how digital health can support the diabetes community through the pandemic.
32392473,For those living with diabetes, digital health presents the opportunity to access care with greater convenience while not having to expose themselves to infection in an in-person clinic.
32392473,Digital diabetes apps can increase agency in self-care and produce clinically significant improvement in glycemic control through facilitating the capture of diabetes device data.
32392473,However, the ability to share these data back to the clinic to inform virtual care and enhance diabetes coaching and guidance remains a challenge.
32392473,In the end, it requires an unnecessarily high level of technical sophistication on the clinic's part and on those living with diabetes to routinely use their diabetes device data in clinic visits, virtual or otherwise.
32392473,As the world comes together to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, close collaboration among the global diabetes community is critical to understand and manage the sustained impact of the pandemic on people living with diabetes.
32392559,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses several challenges to the management of patients with leukemia.
32392559,The biology of each leukemia and its corresponding treatment with conventional intensive chemotherapy, with or without targeted therapies (venetoclax, FLT3 inhibitors, IDH1/2 inhibitors, Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors), introduce additional layers of complexity during COVID-19 high-risk periods.
32392559,The knowledge about COVID-19 is accumulating rapidly.
32392559,An important distinction is the prevalence of &quot;exposure&quot; versus &quot;clinical infectivity,&quot; which determine the risk versus benefit of modifying potentially highly curative therapies in leukemia.
32392559,At present, the rate of clinical infection is &lt;1-2% worldwide.
32392559,With a mortality rate of 1-5% in CO-VID-19 patients in the general population and potentially of &gt;30% in patients with cancer, careful consideration should be given to the risk of COVID-19 in leukemia.
32392559,Instead of reducing patient access to specialized cancer centers and modifying therapies to ones with unproven curative benefit, there is more rationale for less intensive, yet effective therapies that may require fewer clinic visits or hospitalizations.
32392559,Here, we offer recommendations on the optimization of leukemia management during high-risk COVID-19 periods.
32392562,After the advent of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) commenced across the world.
32392562,Understanding the Immunopathogenesis of COVID-19 is essential for interrupting viral infectivity and preventing aberrant immune responses before a vaccine can be developed.
32392562,In this review, we provide the latest insights into the roles of angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) and Ang II receptor-1 (AT1-R) in this disease.
32392562,Novel therapeutic strategies, including recombinant ACE2, ACE inhibitors, AT1-R blockers, and Ang 1-7 peptides, may prevent or reduce viruses-induced pulmonary, cardiac, and renal injuries.
32392562,However, more studies are needed to clarify the efficacy of these therapeutics.
32392562,Furthermore, considering the common role of the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway in AT1-R expressed on peripheral tissues and cytokine receptors on the surface of immune cells, potential targeting of this pathway using JAK inhibitors (JAKinibs) is suggested as a promising approach in patients with COVID-19 who are admitted to hospitals.
32392562,In addition to antiviral therapy, potential ACE2- and AT1-R-inhibiting strategies, and other supportive care, we suggest other potential JAKinibs and novel anti-inflammatory combination therapies that affect the JAK-STAT pathway in patients with COVID-19.
32392562,Since the combination of MTX and baricitinib leads to outstanding clinical outcomes, the addition of baricitinib to MTX might be a potential strategy.
32392624,Early on, geriatricians in Israel viewed with increasing alarm the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32392624,It was clear that this viral disease exhibited a clear predilection for and danger to older persons.
32392624,Informal contacts began with senior officials from the country's Ministry of Health, the Israel Medical Association, and the country's largest health fund; this was done to plan an approach to the possible coming storm.
32392624,A group was formed, comprising three senior geriatricians, a former dean, a palliative care specialist, and a lawyer/ethicist.
32392624,The members made every effort to ensure that their recommendations would be practical while at the same time taking into account the tenets of medical ethics.
32392624,The committee's main task was to think through a workable approach because intensive care unit/ventilator resources may be far outstripped by those requiring such care.
32392624,Recommendations included the approach to older persons both in the community and in long-term care institutions, a triage instrument, and palliative care.
32392624,Patient autonomy was emphasized, with a strong recommendation for people of all ages to update their advance directives or, if they did not have any, to quickly draw them up.
32392624,Considering the value of distributive justice, with respect to triage, a &quot;soft utilitarian&quot; approach was advocated with the main criteria being function and comorbidity.
32392624,Although chronological age was rejected as a sole criterion, in the case of an overwhelming crisis, &quot;biological age&quot; would enter into the triage considerations, but only in the case of distinguishing between people with equal non-age-related deficits.
32392624,The guideline emphasized that no matter what, in the spirit of beneficence, anyone who fell ill must receive active palliative care throughout the course of a COVD-19 infection but especially at the end of life.
32392624,Furthermore, in the spirit of nonmaleficence, the frail, very old, and severely demented would be actively protected from dying on ventilation.
32392741,A novel highly pathogenic human coronavirus able to induce severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been recently recognized as the cause of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, which has spread rapidly from China to other countries.
32392741,Little is known about laboratory prognostic markers in COVID-19 patients.
32392741,The aim of our study was to describe the basic clotting parameters in COVID-19 patients and their prognostic role in different clinical forms of the disease.
32392741,We enrolled 67 COVID-19 patients admitted to the Emergency Department.
32392741,A cohort of 67 age- and sex-matched non-COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory illness was used as a control group.
32392741,For all patients, platelet count (PLT), prothrombin time (PT), activated thromboplastin time (aPTT), C-reactive protein (PCR), fibrinogen, and D-dimer were determined.
32392741,The COVID-19 population was divided in two groups according to the presence or absence of SARS.
32392741,The clotting factors values were compared between the groups.
32392741,At admission, the COVID-19 patients showed statistically significant increased levels of fibrinogen (601.5 (480-747) vs.
32392741,455 (352.5-588.5) mg/dL; <i>p</i> = 0.0000064), and a higher percentage of patients had fibrinogen levels &gt;400 mg/dL (86% vs.58%; <i>p</i> = 0.0054) compared to the control group.
32392741,The levels of fibrinogen were higher in COVID-19 patients with SARS compared to those without SARS (747 (600.0-834.0) vs.
32392741,567 (472.5-644.50); <i>p</i> = 0.0003).
32392741,Fibrinogen seems to increase early in COVID-19 patients and may be used as a risk stratification marker for the early detection of a subgroup of COVID-19 patient at increased risk to develop SARS, who might benefit from a different and thorough clinical surveillance and treatment.
32392859,Severe acute respiratory syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel viral infection characterized by several symptoms range from mild to severe clinical conditions that could lead to death.
32392859,We report two different radiological findings on computed tomography (CT) in two patients affected by SARS-CoV-2: a lung acute embolism (APE) in the first case and a radiological picture of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in the second case.
32392859,This is an important issue to be identified in order to provide more specific therapy earlier, including both antiviral and anti-inflammatory drugs associated with anti anticoagulant therapy.
32393325,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly evolved into a worldwide pandemic.
32393325,Preparing intensive care units (ICU) is an integral part of any pandemic response.
32393325,In this review, we discuss the key principles and strategies for ICU preparedness.
32393325,We also describe our initial outbreak measures and share some of the challenges faced.
32393325,To achieve sustainable ICU services, we propose the need to 1) prepare and implement rapid identification and isolation protocols, and a surge in ICU bed capacity; (2) provide a sustainable workforce with a focus on infection control; (3) ensure adequate supplies to equip ICUs and protect healthcare workers; and (4) maintain quality clinical management, as well as effective communication.
32393381,Many healthcare workers were infected by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) early in the epidemic posing a big challenge for epidemic control.
32393381,Hence, this study aims to explore perceived infection routes, influencing factors, psychosocial changes, and management procedures for COVID-19 infected healthcare workers.
32393381,This is a cross-sectional, single hospital-based study.
32393381,We recruited all 105 confirmed COVID-19 healthcare workers in the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from February 15 to 29, 2020.
32393381,All participants completed a validated questionnaire.
32393381,Electronic consent was obtained from all participants.
32393381,Perceived causes of infection, infection prevention, control knowledge and behaviour, psychological changes, symptoms and treatment were measured.
32393381,Finally, 103 professional staff with COVID-19 finished the questionnaire and was included (response rate: 98.1%).
32393381,Of them, 87 cases (84.5%) thought they were infected in working environment in hospital, one (1.0%) thought their infection was due to the laboratory environment, and 5 (4.9%) thought they were infected in daily life or community environment.
32393381,Swab of throat collection and physical examination were the procedures perceived as most likely causing their infection by nurses and doctors respectively.
32393381,Forty-three (41.8%) thought their infection was related to protective equipment, utilization of common equipment (masks and gloves).
32393381,The top three first symptoms displayed before diagnosis were fever (41.8%), lethargy (33.0%) and muscle aches (30.1%).
32393381,After diagnosis, 88.3% staff experienced psychological stress or emotional changes during their isolation period, only 11.7% had almost no emotional changes.
32393381,Arbidol (Umifenovir; an anti-influza drug; 69.2%) was the drug most commonly used to target infection in mild and moderate symptoms.
32393381,The main perceived mode of transmission was not maintaining protection when working at a close distance and having intimate contact with infected cases.
32393381,Positive psychological intervention is necessary.
32393401,World Health Organization announced the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak to be a global pandemic.
32393401,The distribution of community outbreaks shows seasonal patterns along certain latitude, temperature, and humidity i.e. similar to the behavior of seasonal viral respiratory tract infections.
32393401,COVID-19 displays significant spread in northern midlatitude countries with an average temperature of 5-11 °C and low humidity.
32393401,Vitamin D deficiency has also been described as pandemic, especially in the Europe.Regardless of age, ethnicity, and latitude; recent data showed that 40% of the Europeans are vitamin D deficient (25(OH)D levels &lt;50 nmol/L), and 13% are severely deficient (25(OH)D &lt;30 nmol/L).
32393401,A quadratic relationship was found between the prevalences of vitamin D deficiency in most commonly affected countries by COVID-19 and the latitudes.
32393401,Vitamin D deficiency is more common in the subtropical and midlatitude countries than the tropical and high latitude countries.
32393401,The most commonly affected countries with severe vitamin D deficiency are from the subtropical (Saudi Arabia; 46%, Qatar; 46%, Iran; 33.4%, Chile; 26.4%) and midlatitude (France; 27.3%, Portugal; 21.2% and Austria; 19.3%) regions.
32393401,Severe vitamin D deficiency was found to be nearly 0% in some high latitude countries (e.g.
32393401,Norway, Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Netherlands).
32393401,Accordingly, we would like to call attention to the possible association between severe vitamin D deficiency and mortality pertaining to COVID-19.
32393401,Given its rare side effects and relatively wide safety, prophylactic vitamin D supplementation and/or food fortification might reasonably serve as a very convenient adjuvant therapy for these two worldwide public health problems alike.
32393438,Platelets are anucleate cells in blood whose principal function is to stop bleeding by forming aggregates for hemostatic reactions.
32393438,In addition to their participation in physiological hemostasis, platelet aggregates are also involved in pathological thrombosis and play an important role in inflammation, atherosclerosis, and cancer metastasis.
32393438,The aggregation of platelets is elicited by various agonists, but these platelet aggregates have long been considered indistinguishable and impossible to classify.
32393438,Here we present an intelligent method for classifying them by agonist type.
32393438,It is based on a convolutional neural network trained by high-throughput imaging flow cytometry of blood cells to identify and differentiate subtle yet appreciable morphological features of platelet aggregates activated by different types of agonists.
32393438,The method is a powerful tool for studying the underlying mechanism of platelet aggregation and is expected to open a window on an entirely new class of clinical diagnostics, pharmacometrics, and therapeutics.
32393438,Platelets are small cells in the blood that primarily help stop bleeding after an injury by sticking together with other blood cells to form a clot that seals the broken blood vessel.
32393438,Blood clots, however, can sometimes cause harm.
32393438,For example, if a clot blocks the blood flow to the heart or the brain, it can result in a heart attack or stroke, respectively.
32393438,Blood clots have also been linked to harmful inflammation and the spread of cancer, and there are now preliminary reports of remarkably high rates of clotting in COVID-19 patients in intensive care units.
32393438,A variety of chemicals can cause platelets to stick together.
32393438,It has long been assumed that it would be impossible to tell apart the clots formed by different chemicals (which are also known as agonists).
32393438,This is largely because these aggregates all look very similar under a microscope, making it incredibly time consuming for someone to look at enough microscopy images to reliably identify the subtle differences between them.
32393438,However, finding a way to distinguish the different types of platelet aggregates could lead to better ways to diagnose or treat blood vessel-clogging diseases.
32393438,To make this possible, Zhou, Yasumoto et al. have developed a method called the “intelligent platelet aggregate classifier” or iPAC for short.
32393438,First, numerous clot-causing chemicals were added to separate samples of platelets taken from healthy human blood.
32393438,The method then involved using high-throughput techniques to take thousands of images of these samples.
32393438,Then, a sophisticated computer algorithm called a deep learning model analyzed the resulting image dataset and “learned” to distinguish the chemical causes of the platelet aggregates based on subtle differences in their shapes.
32393438,Finally, Zhou, Yasumoto et al. verified iPAC method’s accuracy using a new set of human platelet samples.
32393438,The iPAC method may help scientists studying the steps that lead to clot formation.
32393438,It may also help clinicians distinguish which clot-causing chemical led to a patient’s heart attack or stroke.
32393438,This could help them choose whether aspirin or another anti-platelet drug would be the best treatment.
32393438,But first more studies are needed to confirm whether this method is a useful tool for drug selection or diagnosis.
32393447,It is now well established that non-communicable diseases (NCD), like diabetes mellitus, hypertension,, respiratory and heart disease, particularly among the elderly, increase the susceptibility to COVID-19 disease.
32393447,Mortality in 60%-90% of the COVID-19 cases is attributed to either one or more of these comorbidities.
32393447,However, healthcare management for control of COVID-19 involves public health and policy decisions that may critically undermine the existing health needs of the most vulnerable NCD patients.
32393447,Temporary closure of outpatient health facilities in some secondary and tertiary care hospitals have deprived millions of NCD patients of their regular medication and diagnostic health needs.
32393447,The lack of robust primary healthcare facilities in most states, and the failure to maintain physical distancing norms due to inadequate infrastructure is also problematic.
32393447,In the absence of effective public health interventions, socioeconomically vulnerable patients are likely to become non-adherent increasing manifold their risk of disease complications.
32393447,In this context, the feasibility of dispensing longer than usual drug refills for chronic NCD conditions at functional government health facilities, home delivery of essential drugs, running dedicated NCD clinics at PHCs, and utilisation of telemedicine opportunities for care and support to patients warrant aggressive exploration.
32393447,Keywords: Covid-19, NCDs, Medical ethics, epidemic, India.
32393448,The National Task Force for Covid-19 of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in a bulletin dated March 21, 2020 recommended the use of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis in asymptomatic health care workers caring for suspected or confirmed patients and household contacts of confirmed patients.
32393448,This is cause for concern with regard to bioethics and good clinical practice.
32393448,The evidence for the efficacy of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine is currently derived from open label trials and cell culture studies with no conclusive evidence available from randomised clinical trials.
32393448,Hydroxychloroquine also carries contraindications in the case of conditions such as maculopathy, retinopathy and QTc prolongation and should be used with caution in vulnerable populations such as children, pregnancy, lactation and the elderly.
32393448,Despite this, there has been a rush to procure and self-medicate with hydroxychloroquine, which has been addressed by the National Task Force.
32393448,The WHO and the FDA have not found adequate evidence to recommend any specific medication for the treatment of Covid-19.
32393448,While further evidence is awaited, including from trials registered with the FDA and the ICMR, it is recommended that the administration of hydroxychloroquine for chemo-prophylaxis be considered on a case by case basis with monitoring by a registered medical practitioner including electrocardiography (ECG).
32393448,The potential for retinal and cardiac toxicity must also be borne in mind.
32393448,It is further recommended that a public advisory regarding the need for caution in chemo-prophylaxis be made available in the public domain.

32393594,Patients with COPD have an increased risk for severity of COVID-19.
32393594,Flu-like symptoms with dyspnea may distinguish COVID-19 infection from dyspnea due to a COPD-related exacerbation.
32393594,Management of COPD with COVID-19 warrants standard-of-care treatment with antimicrobial agents and corticosteroids, though limiting the dose and duration of steroids use may be warranted due to the risk of increased viral shedding.
32393594,Modalities to treat acute respiratory failure can be used with some caveats.
32393594,Patients with COPD and COVID-19 infection who treat their illness at home should self-isolate, use nebulizers in ways that avoid viral aerosolization, and frequently disinfect room surfaces.
32393596,Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a pulmonary vascular disease characterized by pulmonary arterial remodeling and vasoconstriction leading to elevated pulmonary artery pressure and, ultimately, right heart failure.
32393596,So far, few cases of COVID-19 disease in patients with PH have been reported.
32393596,Caution is warranted in interpreting this observation as data are evolving and several factors may influence the number of reported cases of PH and COVID-19.
32393596,Social distancing and quarantine could play a role, especially for patients with chronic diseases who might be more vigilant of their potential for respiratory infection.
32393596,In addition, PH is a rare disease, and because testing is not universal, we could be underestimating the number of cases.
32393596,Other hypothetical factors to consider are the underlying pathophysiology of PH and the medications used to treat PH and their implications in COVID-19.
32393597,Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is in short supply as a result of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, presenting a challenge to rheumatologists to ensure their patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) continue to take this essential drug.
32393597,HCQ is the only SLE treatment shown to increase survival and any change in the HCQ regimen is potentially dangerous.
32393597,Changes in the HCQ regimen should be made jointly with the patient after a discussion of the available evidence and expert opinion and the patient's preferences.
32393597,Providers need to make thoughtful, informed decisions in this time of medication shortage.
32393664,To characterize hydroxychloroquine exposure in patients with rheumatic disease receiving long-term hydroxychloroquine compared to target concentrations with reported antiviral activity against the 2019 coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
32393664,We evaluated total hydroxychloroquine concentrations in serum and plasma from published literature values, frozen serum samples from a pediatric lupus trial, and simulated concentrations using a published pharmacokinetic model during pregnancy.
32393664,For each source, we compared observed or predicted hydroxychloroquine concentrations to target concentrations with reported antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2.
32393664,The average total serum/plasma hydroxychloroquine concentrations were below the lowest SARS-CoV-2 target of 0.48 mg/L in all studies.
32393664,Assuming the highest antiviral target exposure (total plasma concentration of 4.1 mg/L), all studies had approximately one-tenth the necessary concentration for in-vitro viral inhibition.
32393664,Pharmacokinetic model simulations confirmed that pregnant adults receiving common dosing for rheumatic diseases did not achieve target exposures; however, the models predict that a dosage of 600 mg once a day during pregnancy would obtain the lowest median target exposure for most patients after the first dose.
32393664,We found that the average patient receiving treatment with hydroxychloroquine for rheumatic diseases, including children and non-pregnant/pregnant adults, are unlikely to achieve total serum or plasma concentrations shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in-vitro.
32393664,Nevertheless, patients receiving hydroxychloroquine long-term may have tissue concentrations far exceeding that of serum/plasma.
32393664,Because the therapeutic window for hydroxychloroquine in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 is unknown, well-designed clinical trials that include patients with rheumatic disease are urgently needed to characterize the efficacy, safety, and target exposures for hydroxychloroquine.
32393985,Sepsis is a life-threatening complication of pneumonia, including coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19)-induced pneumonia.
32393985,Evidence of the benefits of vitamin C (VC) for the treatment of sepsis is accumulating.
32393985,However, data revealing the targets and molecular mechanisms of VC action against sepsis are limited.
32393985,In this report, a bioinformatics analysis of network pharmacology was conducted to demonstrate screening targets, biological functions, and the signaling pathways of VC action against sepsis.
32393985,As shown in network assays, 63 primary causal targets for the VC action against sepsis were identified from the data, and four optimal core targets for the VC action against sepsis were identified.
32393985,These core targets were epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), mitogen-activated protein kinase-1 (MAPK1), proto-oncogene c (JUN), and signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3).
32393985,In addition, all biological processes (including a top 20) and signaling pathways (including a top 20) potentially involved in the VC action against sepsis were identified.
32393985,The hub genes potentially involved in the VC action against sepsis and interlaced networks from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes Mapper assays were highlighted.
32393985,Considering all the bioinformatic findings, we conclude that VC antisepsis effects are mechanistically and pharmacologically implicated with suppression of immune dysfunction-related and inflammation-associated functional processes and other signaling pathways.
32393985,These primary predictive biotargets may potentially be used to treat sepsis in future clinical practice.
32394153,COVID19 pandemic poses a global threat, with many unknowns.
32394153,The potential for resource limited countries to suffer huge mortality is of major concern.
32394153,Prevention and risk reduction strategies are paramount in the current absence of effective treatment or a vaccine.
32394153,There is a global shortage of personal protective equipment.
32394153,This short paper describes the rationale for and development of a cloth homemade mask and has a step by step video.
32394153,The template is reproducible around the world and is both washable and cheap.
32394153,This article describes a simple way to make a cloth mask, suitable if medical masks are not available.
32394237,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease that primarily affects the respiratory system, but it may cause cardiovascular complications such as thromboembolism.
32394237,Rarely, pulmonary embolism may be encountered in patients with severe COVID-19 infection, especially in intensive care units.
32394237,An asymptomatic young case of COVID-19 presenting with sudden death due to acute massive pulmonary embolism has not been previously described.
32394237,We report a 41-year-old woman presented to emergency department with sudden death during physical activity.
32394237,She had only history of diabetes mellitus and she was asymptomatic until sudden death.
32394237,CT pulmonary angiography and chest CT scans revealed acute massive embolism and typical imaging findings of COVID-19 pneumonia, respectively.
32394237,Interestingly, the patient had no symptoms or signs of infection and also had no risk factors for thromboembolism.
32394237,COVID-19 infection appears to induce venous thromboembolism, especially pulmonary embolism.
32394237,The case is remarkable in terms of showing how insidious and life-threatening COVID-19 infection can be.
32394338,Symptom management and end-of-life care are core skills for all physicians, although in ordinary times many anesthesiologists have fewer occasions to use these skills.
32394338,The current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has caused significant mortality over a short time and has necessitated an increase in provision of both critical care and palliative care.
32394338,For anesthesiologists deployed to units caring for patients with COVID-19, this narrative review provides guidance on conducting goals of care discussions, withdrawing life-sustaining measures, and managing distressing symptoms.
32394344,Data on people living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLWH) in the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic are still scarce.
32394344,This case series of 33 PLWH patients with COVID-19 reveals symptoms and outcome in this special population.
32394344,Retrospective analysis of anonymized data including age, gender, HIV-associated parameters, symptoms, and outcome.
32394344,Three out of 32 patients with documented outcomes died (9%). 91% of the patients recovered and 76% have been classified as mild cases.
32394344,All patients were on antiretroviral treatment, of them 22 on tenofovir-containing regimen and 4 on the protease inhibitor darunavir.
32394344,This preliminary case series does not support excess morbidity and mortality among symptomatic COVID-19 PLWH and with viral suppression on ART.
32394344,SARS-CoV-2 infections may occur during boosted darunavir-based and/or on tenofovir-containing ART.
32394416,COVID-19 is a new disease, based on currently available limited information, older adults and people of any age who have severe underlying medical conditions may be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
32394416,People of all age groups are also at risk.
32394416,Healthcare providers have always been the professionals most exposed to the risk of contracting to any kind of infection due to the nature of their profession.
32394416,Elective interventions have been postponed to give care of patients with COVID-19.
32394416,However, some interventions cannot be delayed, such as trauma surgery, acute abdomen, and emergency endoscopies.
32394416,To maintain the sustainability of the healthcare system, the protection of healthcare providers should be the top priority.
32394416,On the other hand, patients, who need emergency healthcare, should also be provided with appropriate treatment.
32394416,Healthcare professionals should choose a treatment method appropriately in the circumstances to protect themselves and their patients as much as possible.
32394416,This paper aims to summarize how a surgeon may act appropriately when an intervention is inevitable during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32394467,In late December 2019 in Wuhan, China, several patients with viral pneumonia were identified as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
32394467,So far, there are no specific treatments for patients with coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), and the treatments available today are based on previous experience with similar viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and Influenza virus.
32394467,In this article, we have tried to reach a therapeutic window of drugs available to patients with COVID-19.
32394467,Cathepsin L is required for entry of the 2019-nCoV virus into the cell as target teicoplanin inhibits virus replication.
32394467,Angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2 (ACE2) in soluble form as a recombinant protein can prevent the spread of coronavirus by restricting binding and entry.
32394467,In patients with COVID-19, hydroxychloroquine decreases the inflammatory response and cytokine storm, but overdose causes toxicity and mortality.
32394467,Neuraminidase inhibitors such as oseltamivir, peramivir, and zanamivir are invalid for 2019-nCoV and are not recommended for treatment but protease inhibitors such as lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) inhibit the progression of MERS-CoV disease and can be useful for patients of COVID-19 and, in combination with Arbidol, has a direct antiviral effect on early replication of SARS-CoV.
32394467,Ribavirin reduces hemoglobin concentrations in respiratory patients, and remdesivir improves respiratory symptoms.
32394467,Use of ribavirin in combination with LPV/r in patients with SARS-CoV reduces acute respiratory distress syndrome and mortality, which has a significant protective effect with the addition of corticosteroids.
32394467,Favipiravir increases clinical recovery and reduces respiratory problems and has a stronger antiviral effect than LPV/r. currently, appropriate treatment for patients with COVID-19 is an ACE2 inhibitor and a clinical problem reducing agent such as favipiravir in addition to hydroxychloroquine and corticosteroids.
32394481,On March 16, 2020, the French Society of Pharmacology and Therapeutics put online a national Question and Answer (Q&amp;A) website, https://sfpt-fr.org/covid19 on the proper use of drugs during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32394481,The working group &quot;Drugs and COVID-19&quot; was composed of a scientific council, an editorial team and experts in the field.
32394481,The first questions were posted online during the first evening of home-confinement in France, March 17, 2020.
32394481,Six weeks later, 140 Q&amp;As have been posted.
32394481,Questions on the controversial use of hydroxychloroquine and to a lesser extent concerning azithromycin have been the most consulted Q&amp;As.
32394481,Q&amp;As has been consulted 226,014 times in 41 days.
32394481,This large visibility was obtained through an early communication on Twitter, Facebook, traditional print and web media.
32394481,In addition, an early communication through the French Ministry of Health and the French National Agency for Medicines and Health Products Safety ANSM had a large impact in terms of daily number of views.
32394481,There is a pressing need to sustain a public drug information service combining the expertise of scholarly pharmacology societies, pharmacovigilance network, and the Ministry of Health to quickly provide understandable, clear, expert answers to the general population's concerns regarding COVID-19 and drug use and to counter fake news.
32394639,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by a novel betacoronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), similar to SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), which cause acute respiratory distress syndrome and case fatalities.
32394639,COVID-19 disease severity is worse in older obese patients with comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and chronic lung disease.
32394639,Cell binding and entry of betacoronaviruses is via their surface spike glycoprotein; SARS-CoV binds to the metalloprotease angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), MERS-CoV utilizes dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), and recent modeling of the structure of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein predicts that it can interact with human DPP4 in addition to ACE2.
32394639,DPP4 is a ubiquitous membrane-bound aminopeptidase that circulates in plasma; it is multifunctional with roles in nutrition, metabolism, and immune and endocrine systems.
32394639,DPP4 activity differentially regulates glucose homeostasis and inflammation via its enzymatic activity and nonenzymatic immunomodulatory effects.
32394639,The importance of DPP4 for the medical community has been highlighted by the approval of DPP4 inhibitors, or gliptins, for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
32394639,This review discusses the dysregulation of DPP4 in COVID-19 comorbid conditions; DPP4 activity is higher in older individuals and increased plasma DPP4 is a predictor of the onset of metabolic syndrome.
32394639,DPP4 upregulation may be a determinant of COVID-19 disease severity, which creates interest regarding the use of gliptins in management of COVID-19.
32394639,Also, knowledge of the chemistry and biology of DPP4 could be utilized to develop novel therapies to block viral entry of some betacoronaviruses, potentially including SARS-CoV-2.
32395064,COVID-19 pandemic has emerged as a global health emergency involving more than 200 countries so far.
32395064,The number of affected population is on rising, so is the mortality.
32395064,This crisis has overwhelmed the healthcare infrastructures in many affected countries.
32395064,Due to overall rising cancer incidence and specific concerns, a cohort of cancer patients forms a distinct subset of the population in whom a correct and timely treatment has a huge impact on the outcome.
32395064,During this period, oncology care is definitely affected owing to many factors like lockdowns, reduced beds and deferral of elective cases to halt the spread of the pandemic.
32395064,Surgery remains the best line of defence in many solid organ tumours especially in early stage and is potentially curative.
32395064,China, the source of this pandemic, has taken more than 3 months to enter the post transitional phase of this pandemic.
32395064,Deferring cancer surgeries for this long period may have a direct impact on the long-term outcomes of cancer patients.
32395064,Many surgical oncology associations across the globe have come up with triage guidelines for surgical care of cancer patients; however, these are based on expert opinion rather than actual data.
32395064,Herein, we intend to review these guidelines with respect to the risk of disease progression in cancer patients.
32395064,In the absence of actual data on cancer surgery care during this pandemic, clinical decisions should be based on careful consideration of disease-related and patient-related factors.
32395064,While some of the cancer surgeries can be safely delayed for some time, how long we can delay surgeries safely cannot be answered/ explained by any means.
32395064,Thorough evaluation and discussion by an expert and experienced multidisciplinary team appears to be the most effective way forward.
32395179,The value of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for patients suffering from novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a rescue therapy for respiratory failure remains controversial and associated with high mortality rates of 50 to 82% in early reports from Wuhan, China.
32395179,We hypothesized that patient outcomes would be improved at our tertiary cardiothoracic surgery referral center with a protocolized team-approach for ECMO treatment of patients with severe COVID-19 disease.
32395179,A 51-year-old healthy female developed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) bilateral pneumonia while vacationing in Colorado with her family.
32395179,She was transferred to our facility for a higher level of care.
32395179,Her respiratory status continued to deteriorate despite maximized critical care, including prone positioning ventilation and nitric oxide inhalation therapy.
32395179,Veno-venous ECMO was initiated on hospital day 7 in conjunction with a 10-day course of compassionate use antiviral treatment with remdesivir.
32395179,The patient's condition improved significantly and she was decannulated from ECMO on hospital day 17 (ECMO day 11).
32395179,She was successfully extubated and eventually discharged to rehabilitation on hospital day 28.
32395179,This case report demonstrates a positive outcome in a young patient with COVID-19 treated by the judicious application of ECMO in conjunction with compassionate use antiviral treatment (remdesivir).
32395179,Future prospective multi-center studies are needed to validate these findings in a larger cohort of patients.
32395417,COVID-19 presents as a pandemic requiring the utmost attention from the world, especially the healthcare sector.
32395417,This review intends to discuss the symptoms, prevention, and management carried out related to the coronavirus, while also providing the healthcare provider strategies used by different countries in combating the disease.
32395417,This study was conducted over a period of 2 weeks where different sources were used to assess the ongoing situation regarding COVID-19.
32395417,The data used in this study was verified and collected from authentic sources only.
32395417,Results show that there is at present no definite cure for the disease and that prevention is the best possible defense at our disposal at the moment.
32395417,Data reviewed suggests that social distancing and isolation is the best possible option at the moment.
32395417,This study provides an overview of the developments taking place in response to the pandemic.
32395417,More research is required, especially in the treatment and prevention of the disease, so that we may progress towards finding a cure as well as creating a vaccine for the COVID-19.
32395418,The current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has presented unprecedented challenges to the healthcare systems in almost every country around the world.
32395418,Currently, there are no proven effective vaccines or therapeutic agents against the virus.
32395418,Current clinical management includes infection prevention and control measures and supportive care including supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilatory support.
32395418,Evolving research and clinical data regarding the virologic SARS-CoV-2 suggest a potential list of repurposed drugs with appropriate pharmacological effects and therapeutic efficacies in treating COVID-19 patients.
32395418,In this review, we will update and summarize the most common and plausible drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.
32395418,These drugs and therapeutic agents include antiviral agents (remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, lopinavir, umifenovir, favipiravir, and oseltamivir), and supporting agents (Ascorbic acid, Azithromycin, Corticosteroids, Nitric oxide, IL-6 antagonists), among others.
32395418,We hope that this review will provide useful and most updated therapeutic drugs to prevent, control, and treat COVID-19 patients until the approval of vaccines and specific drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2.
32395419,The recent pandemic outbreak of COVID-19 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; SARS-CoV-2) worldwide caught the health care systems in every country around the world by storm and without a proper defense mechanism to cope and control such a pandemic.
32395419,In this special Theme issue, we would like to discuss the latest treatment modalities available around the world in tackling this dreadful disease.
32395474,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a novel coronavirus (designated as SARS-CoV-2) has become a pandemic worldwide.
32395474,Based on the current reports, hypertension may be associated with increased risk of sever condition in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
32395474,Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was recently identified to functional receptor of SARS-CoV-2.
32395474,Previous experimental data revealed ACE2 level was increased following treatment with ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs).
32395474,Currently doctors concern whether these commonly used renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers-ACEIs/ARBs may increase the severity of COVID-19.
32395474,We extracted data regarding 50 hospitalized hypertension patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 in the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from Feb 7 to Mar 03, 2020.
32395474,These patients were grouped into RAS blockers group (Group A, n=20) and non-RAS blockers group (Group B, n=30) according to the basic blood pressure medications.
32395474,All patients continued to use pre-admission antihypertensive drugs.
32395474,Clinical severity (symptoms, laboratory and chest CT findings, etc.), clinical course, and short time outcome were analyzed after hospital admission.
32395474,Ten (50%) and seventeen (56.7%) of the Group A and Group B participants were males (P=0.643), and the average age was 52.65±13.12 and 67.77±12.84 years (P=0.000), respectively.
32395474,The blood pressure of both groups was under effective control.
32395474,There was no significant difference in clinical severity, clinical course and in-hospital mortality between Group A and Group B.
32395474,Serum cardiac troponin I (cTnI) (P=0.03), and N-terminal (NT)-pro hormone BNP (NT-proBNP) (P=0.04) showed significant lower level in Group A than in Group B.
32395474,But the patients with more than 0.04ng/mL or elevated NT-proBNP level had no statistical significance between the two groups.
32395474,In patients over 65 years or under 65 years, cTnI or NT-proBNP level showed no difference between the two groups.
32395474,We observed there was no obvious difference in clinical characteristics between RAS blockers and non-RAS blockers groups.
32395474,These data suggest ACEIs/ARBs may have few effects on increasing the clinical severe conditions of COVID-19.
32395542,It has been over 2 months since the start of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak.
32395542,The epidemic stage of COVID-19 has brought great challenges to the diagnosis and management of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients.
32395542,Symptoms, such as fever and cough caused by cancer, and the therapeutic process (including chemotherapy and surgery) should be differentiated from some COVID-19 related characteristics.
32395542,Besides, clinical workers should not only consider the therapeutic strategy for cancer, but also emphasize COVID-19's prevention.
32395542,Moreover, the detailed therapeutic regimens of CRC patients may be different from the usual.
32395542,Also, treatment principles may various for CRC patients with or without severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, as well as patients with or without an emergency presentation.
32395542,In this paper, we want to discuss the above-mentioned problems based on previous guidelines, the current working status and our experiences, to provide a reference for medical personnel.
32395550,The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) epidemic continues, with the number of infections and deaths increasing.
32395550,The respiratory tract is the main route of transmission of the virus, and the majority of symptoms are respiratory relative.
32395550,Until now, there has been no reports concerning the nervous system onset.
32395550,We present a 2019-nCoV patient with the onset of simple dizziness, accompanied by dry throat, no fever, no cough, no headache, no mental abnormality, and no obvious abnormality in the nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head.
32395550,Meanwhile, chest computed tomography (CT) scans showed multiple small spot shadows and interstitial changes in the early stage, especially in the extrapulmonary zone.
32395550,There was a development of multiple ground-glass shadows and infiltrative shadows in both lungs with mild pleural effusion.
32395550,The nucleic acid gene detection was positive, and thus the diagnosis of 2019-nCoV was confirmed.
32395550,At last, the prognosis was good after active treatment.
32395550,After antiviral and anti-infective treatment, the symptoms recovered.
32395550,We presume that 2019-nCoV can also manifest in the nervous system alone, and lung CT, which has relative specificity, should be used as a routine screening method.
32395606,The aim of this study was to develop an appropriate anti-viral drug against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
32395606,An immediately qualifying strategy would be to use existing powerful drugs from various virus treatments.
32395606,The strategy in virtual screening of antiviral databases for possible therapeutic effect would be to identify promising drug molecules, as there is currently no vaccine or treatment approved against COVID-19.
32395606,Targeting the main protease (pdb id: 6LU7) is gaining importance in anti-CoV drug design.
32395606,In this conceptual context, an attempt has been made to suggest an <i>in silico</i> computational relationship between US-FDA approved drugs, plant-derived natural drugs, and Coronavirus main protease (6LU7) protein.
32395606,The evaluation of results was made based on Glide (Schrödinger) dock score.
32395606,Out of 62 screened compounds, the best docking scores with the targets were found for compounds: lopinavir, amodiaquine, and theaflavin digallate (TFDG).
32395606,Molecular dynamic (MD) simulation study was also performed for 20 ns to confirm the stability behaviour of the main protease and inhibitor complexes.
32395606,The MD simulation study validated the stability of three compounds in the protein binding pocket as potent binders.
32395672,As the COVID-19 pandemic spreads around the globe, access to radiation therapy remains critical for cancer patients.
32395672,The priority for all radiation oncology departments is to protect the staff and to maintain operations in providing access to those patients requiring radiation therapy services.
32395672,Patients with tumors of the aerodigestive tract and pelvis amongst others often experience toxicity during treatment, and there is a baseline risk that adverse effects may require hospital-based management.
32395672,Routine care during weekly visits is important to guide patients through treatment and to mitigate against the need for hospitalization.
32395672,Nevertheless, hospitalizations occur and there is a risk of nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 spread.
32395672,During the COVID-19 pandemic, typical resources used to help manage patients, such as dental services, interventional radiology, rehabilitation and others are limited or not at all available.
32395672,Recognizing the need to provide access to treatment and the anticipated toxicity of such treatment, we have developed and implemented guidelines for clinical care management with the hope of avoiding added risk to our patients.
32395672,If successful, these concepts may be integrated into our care directives in non-pandemic times.
32395673,The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has led to a pandemic affecting healthcare centers across the globe.
32395673,Patients with cancer have been reported to be particularly vulnerable to infection, morbidity, and severe events.
32395673,Given the high proportion of asymptomatic carriers and concerns regarding speed and availability of laboratory testing, novel detection strategies are necessary to supplement traditional screening methods and facilitate mitigation of viral transmission.
32395673,Recent data support the diagnostic consistency and potential value of computed tomography (CT) scans to aid early diagnosis of COVID-19.
32395673,Volumetric CT image-guidance is commonly employed in patients undergoing radiotherapy and presents a unique opportunity to screen for COVID-specific lung changes.
32395673,This case series describes the presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infections among three patients undergoing thoracic radiotherapy across multiple institutions.
32395673,We highlight their clinical symptoms, imaging findings, potential confounders, and clinical workflow to triage these patients to the next level of care.
32395850,The Australian Treatment Outcomes Profile (ATOP) is a brief clinical tool measuring recent substance use, health and wellbeing among clients attending alcohol and other drug (AOD) treatment services.
32395850,It has previously been assessed for concurrent validity and inter-rater reliability.
32395850,In this study we examine whether it is suitable for administration over the telephone.
32395850,We recruited a sample of 107 AOD clients across public sector specialist AOD treatment services in New South Wales, Australia between 2016 and 2018.
32395850,Participants had a mean age of 47 years and 46% were female.
32395850,Participants completed a face-to-face ATOP and a phone ATOP with a researcher within 5 days.
32395850,Comparisons between the two administration modes were undertaken using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient for continuous or ordinal variables, and Cohen's Kappa for nominal variables.
32395850,Among 107 participants, 59% were attending for alcohol treatment and 41% for opioid treatment.
32395850,Most ATOP items (76%) reached above 0.7 (good) or 0.9 (excellent) agreement between face-to-face and telephone use.
32395850,Our findings suggest that the ATOP is a suitable instrument for telephone monitoring of recent substance use, health and social functioning among AOD clients.
32395850,Its validation for remote use over the telephone will support staff to monitor clients' risks and outcomes-of particular relevance in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in which services are increasingly relying on telework approaches to client monitoring.
32396101,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a pandemic with serious clinical manifestations including death.
32396101,A pandemic at the large-scale like COVID-19 places extraordinary demands on the world's health systems, dramatically devastates vulnerable populations, and critically threatens the global communities in an unprecedented way.
32396101,While tremendous efforts at the frontline are placed on detecting the virus, providing treatments and developing vaccines, it is also critically important to examine the technologies and systems for tackling disease emergence, arresting its spread and especially the strategy for diseases prevention.
32396101,The objective of this article is to review enabling technologies and systems with various application scenarios for handling the COVID-19 crisis.
32396101,The article will focus specifically on 1) wearable devices suitable for monitoring the populations at risk and those in quarantine, both for evaluating the health status of caregivers and management personnel, and for facilitating triage processes for admission to hospitals; 2) unobtrusive sensing systems for detecting the disease and for monitoring patients with relatively mild symptoms whose clinical situation could suddenly worsen in improvised hospitals; and 3) telehealth technologies for the remote monitoring and diagnosis of COVID-19 and related diseases.
32396101,Finally, further challenges and opportunities for future directions of development are highlighted.
32396134,Endocrinologists have had to make rapid changes to services so that resources can be focused on the COVID-19 response to help prevent spread of the virus.
32396134,Herein we provide pragmatic advice on the management of commonly encountered calcium problems and osteoporosis.
32396134,Non-urgent elective appointments should be postponed, and remote consultations and digital health solutions promoted.
32396134,Patients should be empowered to self-manage their conditions safely.
32396134,Patients, their caregivers and healthcare providers should be directed to online resources e.g.
32396134,Society for Endocrinology, Royal Osteoporosis Society, International Osteoporosis Foundation, specific patient groups and the European Reference Networks (ERNs) for Rare Endocrine and Rare Bone disorders.
32396134,For patients in acute hospital settings, existing emergency guidance on the management of hyper- and hypo-calcaemia should be followed.
32396134,A pragmatic, symptom-based approach should be implemented in patients at the end of life.
32396134,An approach to osteoporosis management is outlined.
32396134,IV zoledronic acid infusions can be delayed for 6-9 months during the pandemic.
32396134,Patients established on denosumab and teriparatide should continue planned therapy.
32396134,The challenge of this pandemic will act as a catalyst to innovate within our management of metabolic bone and mineral disorders to ensure best use of resources and resilience of healthcare systems in its aftermath.
32396143,In December, 2019, China, has experienced an outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32396143,Coronavirus has now spread to all of the continents.
32396143,We aimed to consider clinical characteristics, laboratory data of COVID-19 that provided more information for the research of this novel virus.
32396143,We performed a retrospective cohort study on the clinical symptoms and laboratory findings of a series of the 100 confirmed patients with COVID-19.
32396143,These patients were admitted to the hospitals affiliated to Babol University of Medical Sciences (Ayatollah Rohani, Shahid Beheshti and Yahyanejad hospitals) form 25 February 2020 to 12 March 2020.
32396143,Nineteen patients died during hospitalization and 81 were discharged.
32396143,Non-survivor patients had a significantly higher C-reactive protein (CRP) (MD: 46.37, 95% CI: 20.84, 71.90; P= 0.001), white blood cells (WBCs) (MD: 3.10, 95% CI: 1.53, 4.67; P&lt; 0.001) and lower lymphocyte (MD: -8.75, 95% CI: -12.62, -4.87; P&lt; 0.001) compared to survivor patients Data analysis showed that comorbid conditions (aRR: 2.99, 95%CI: 1.09, 8.21, P= 0.034), higher CRP levels (aRR: 1.02, 95%CI: 1.01, 1.03, P= 0.044), and lower lymphocyte (aRR: 0.82, 95%CI: 0.73, 0.93, P= 0.003) were associated with increased risk of death.
32396143,Based on our findings, most non-survivors are elderly with comorbidities.
32396143,Lymphopenia and increased levels of WBCs along with elevated CRP were associated with increased risk of death.
32396143,Therefore, it is best to be regularly assessed these markers during treatment of COVID-19 patients.
32396163,Early identification of patients with novel corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who may develop critical illness is of great importance and may aid in delivering proper treatment and optimizing use of resources.
32396163,To develop and validate a clinical score at hospital admission for predicting which patients with COVID-19 will develop critical illness based on a nationwide cohort in China.
32396163,Collaborating with the National Health Commission of China, we established a retrospective cohort of patients with COVID-19 from 575 hospitals in 31 provincial administrative regions as of January 31, 2020.
32396163,Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and imaging variables ascertained at hospital admission were screened using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and logistic regression to construct a predictive risk score (COVID-GRAM).
32396163,The score provides an estimate of the risk that a hospitalized patient with COVID-19 will develop critical illness.
32396163,Accuracy of the score was measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).
32396163,Data from 4 additional cohorts in China hospitalized with COVID-19 were used to validate the score.
32396163,Data were analyzed between February 20, 2020 and March 17, 2020.
32396163,Among patients with COVID-19 admitted to the hospital, critical illness was defined as the composite measure of admission to the intensive care unit, invasive ventilation, or death.
32396163,The development cohort included 1590 patients. the mean (SD) age of patients in the cohort was 48.9 (15.7) years; 904 (57.3%) were men.
32396163,The validation cohort included 710 patients with a mean (SD) age of 48.2 (15.2) years, and 382 (53.8%) were men and 172 (24.2%).
32396163,From 72 potential predictors, 10 variables were independent predictive factors and were included in the risk score: chest radiographic abnormality (OR, 3.39; 95% CI, 2.14-5.38), age (OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01-1.05), hemoptysis (OR, 4.53; 95% CI, 1.36-15.15), dyspnea (OR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.18-3.01), unconsciousness (OR, 4.71; 95% CI, 1.39-15.98), number of comorbidities (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.27-2.00), cancer history (OR, 4.07; 95% CI, 1.23-13.43), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.02-1.10), lactate dehydrogenase (OR, 1.002; 95% CI, 1.001-1.004) and direct bilirubin (OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.06-1.24).
32396163,The mean AUC in the development cohort was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.85-0.91) and the AUC in the validation cohort was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.84-0.93).
32396163,The score has been translated into an online risk calculator that is freely available to the public (http://118.126.104.170/).
32396163,In this study, a risk score based on characteristics of COVID-19 patients at the time of admission to the hospital was developed that may help predict a patient's risk of developing critical illness.
32396382,News and social media platforms have implicated dietary supplements in the treatment and prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32396382,During this pandemic when information quickly evolves in the presence of contradicting messages and misinformation, the role of the pharmacist is essential.
32396382,Here, we review theoretical mechanisms and evidence related to efficacy and safety of select supplements in the setting of COVID-19, including vitamin C, vitamin D, zinc, elderberry, and silver.
32396382,Evidence evaluating these supplements in COVID-19 patients is lacking, and providers and patients should not rely on dietary supplements to prevent or treat COVID-19.
32396382,Rather, reference to evidence-based guidelines should guide treatment decisions.
32396397,<b> <i>Background:</i> </b> Pregnant women with diabetes are identified as being more vulnerable to the severe effects of COVID-19 and advised to stringently follow social distancing measures.
32396397,Here, we review the management of diabetes in pregnancy before and during the lockdown. <b> <i>Methods:</i> </b> Majority of antenatal diabetes and obstetric visits are provided remotely, with pregnant women attending hospital clinics only for essential ultrasound scans and labor and delivery.
32396397,Online resources for supporting women planning pregnancy and for self-management of pregnant women with type 1 diabetes (T1D) using intermittent or continuous glucose monitoring are provided.
32396397,Retinal screening procedures, intrapartum care, and the varying impact of lockdown on maternal glycemic control are considered.
32396397,Alternative screening procedures for diagnosing hyperglycemia during pregnancy and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are discussed.
32396397,Case histories describe the remote initiation of insulin pump therapy and automated insulin delivery in T1D pregnancy. <b> <i>Results:</i> </b> Initial feedback suggests that video consultations are well received and that the patient experiences for women requiring face-to-face visits are greatly improved.
32396397,As the pandemic eases, formal evaluation of remote models of diabetes education and technology implementation, including women's views, will be important. <b> <i>Conclusions:</i> </b> Research and audit activities will resume and we will find new ways for supporting pregnant women with diabetes to choose their preferred glucose monitoring and insulin delivery.
32396445,<i>Objective</i>.
32396445,To describe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patient presentations requiring otolaryngology consultation and provide recommendations for protective measures based on the experience of ear, nose, and throat (ENT) departments in 4 Chinese hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic. <i>Study Design</i>.
32396445,Retrospective case series. <i>Setting</i>.
32396445,Multicenter. <i>Subjects and Methods</i>.
32396445,Twenty hospitalized COVID-19 patients requiring ENT consultation from 3 designated COVID-19 hospitals in Wuhan, Shanghai, and Shenzhen were identified.
32396445,Data on demographics, comorbidities, COVID-19 symptoms and severity, consult reason, treatment, and personal protective equipment (PPE) use were collected and analyzed.
32396445,Infection control strategies implemented for ENT outpatients and emergency room visits at the Eye and ENT Hospital of Fudan University were reported. <i>Results</i>.
32396445,Median age was 63 years, 55% were male, and 95% were in severe or critical condition.
32396445,Six tracheotomies were performed.
32396445,Posttracheotomy outcomes were mixed (2 deaths, 2 patients comatose, all living patients still hospitalized).
32396445,Other consults included epistaxis, pharyngitis, nasal congestion, hyposmia, rhinitis, otitis externa, dizziness, and tinnitus.
32396445,At all hospitals, powered air-supply filter respirators (PAPRs) were used for tracheotomy or bleeding control.
32396445,PAPR or N95-equivalent masks plus full protective clothing were used for other complaints.
32396445,No inpatient ENT providers were infected.
32396445,After implementation of infection control strategies for outpatient clinics, emergency visits, and surgeries, no providers were infected at the Eye and ENT Hospital of Fudan University. <i>Conclusions and Relevance</i>.
32396445,COVID-19 patients require ENT consultation for many reasons, including tracheotomy.
32396445,Otolaryngologists play an indispensable role in the treatment of COVID-19 patients but, due to their work, are at high risk of exposure.
32396445,Appropriate protective strategies can prevent infection of otolaryngologists.
32396446,The COVID-19 pandemic has created a number of considerations for otolaryngology; anosmia and ageusia in particular have gained significant attention.
32396446,Here we present considerations in regard to treatment with quinine-derived drugs and the influence of masks on communication.
32396455,The COVID-19 outbreak poses continued struggles due to the unprecedented number of patients admitted to intensive care units and the overwhelming need for mechanical ventilation.
32396455,We report a preliminary case series of 32 patients with COVID-19 who underwent elective tracheostomies after a mean intubation period of 15 days (range, 9-21 days).
32396455,The procedure was performed with percutaneous (10 cases) and open (22 cases) surgical techniques.
32396455,Neither procedure-related complications nor viral transmission to health care workers was observed.
32396455,Our preliminary experience supports the safety of tracheostomy, provided that appropriate protocols are strictly followed.
32396455,The postoperative care is still debated, and, prudentially, our protocol includes tracheal tube change not before 2 weeks after tracheostomy, with cuff deflation and decannulation deferred until confirmation of negative SARS-CoV-2 test results.
32396455,This is the first case series to report on such a rapidly evolving issue and might represent a source of information for clinicians worldwide who will soon be facing the same challenges.
32396601,To provide a comprehensive summary of the implications of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on orthodontic treatment, contingency management, and provision of emergency orthodontic treatment, using currently available data and literature.
32396601,Orthodontically relevant sources of information were searched using electronic databases including PubMed and Google Scholar and current reports from major health bodies such as Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, World Health Organization, National Institutes of Health, and major national orthodontic associations.
32396601,Where available, peer-reviewed and more recent publications were given priority.
32396601,Due to the rapidly evolving nature of COVID-19 and limitations in quality of evidence, a narrative synthesis was undertaken.
32396601,Relevant to orthodontics, human-to human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurs predominantly through the respiratory tract via droplets, secretions (cough, sneeze), and or direct contact, where the virus enters the mucous membrane of the mouth, nose, and eyes.
32396601,The virus can remain stable for days on plastic and stainless steel.
32396601,Most infected persons experience a mild form of disease, but those with advanced age or underlying comorbidities may suffer severe respiratory and multiorgan complications.
32396601,During the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, elective orthodontic treatment should be suspended and resumed only when permitted by federal, provincial, and local health regulatory authorities.
32396601,Emergency orthodontic treatment can be provided by following a contingency plan founded on effective communication and triage.
32396601,Treatment advice should be delivered remotely first when possible, and where necessary, in-person treatment can be performed in a well-prepared operatory following the necessary precautions and infection prevention and control (IPAC) protocol.
32396683,Stroke care in India has evolved rapidly in the last decade with a focus on stroke awareness, prevention, rapid triage, treatment, and rehabilitation.
32396683,But acute stroke care and poststroke rehabilitation in the country have limitations owing to the economic constraints and poor access to health care.
32396683,The SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic has made stroke care even more challenging.
32396683,We outline the unfavorable circumstances in stroke care induced by the pandemic; propose mitigating measures; crisis management; and provide a comparative evaluation of stroke care between India and the United States during the pandemic.
32396683,There is a need for public health systems in both developed and developing countries to improve awareness, implement proper strategies of triage, acute treatment, well-defined rehabilitation plans, telemedicine services, and virtual check-ins.
32396771,The pandemic of COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease-2019) is an extremely contagious respiratory illness due to a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2.
32396771,Certain drugs have several protein targets and many illnesses share overlapping molecular paths.
32396771,In such cases, reusing drugs for more than one objective and finding their novice uses can considerably decrease the time in finding new cures for unforeseen diseases.
32396771,Remdesivir has been recently a strong candidate for the treatment of Covid-19.
32396771,In this commentary, we have portrayed the structure of the coronavirus in a simple way as well as the site where remdesivir acts.
32396771,We have also displayed the ongoing clinical trials, as well as a published study that was conducted on compassionate base.
32396771,The covid-19 pandemic might wean down by the end of summer 2020, but the risk of seasonality exists.
32396771,Therefore, future disposal of agents such as remdesivir might be crucial for ensuring an efficient treatment, decrease mortality and allow early discharge.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

32396773,The current pandemic of Covid-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 is continued to spread globally and no potential drug or vaccine against it is available.
32396773,Spike (S) glycoprotein is the structural protein of SARS-CoV-2 located on the envelope surface, involve in interaction with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a cell surface receptor, followed by entry into the host cell.
32396773,Thereby, blocking the S glycoprotein through potential inhibitor may interfere its interaction with ACE2 and impede its entry into the host cell.
32396773,Here, we present a truncated version of human ACE2 (tACE2), comprising the N terminus region of the intact ACE2 from amino acid position 21-119, involved in binding with receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2.
32396773,We analyzed the in-silico potential of tACE2 to compete with intact ACE2 for binding with RBD.
32396773,The protein-protein docking and molecular dynamic simulation showed that tACE2 has higher binding affinity for RBD and form more stabilized complex with RBD than the intact ACE2.
32396773,Furthermore, prediction of tACE2 soluble expression in <i>E. coli</i> makes it a suitable candidate to be targeted for Covid-19 therapeutics.
32396773,This is the first MD simulation based findings to provide a high affinity protein inhibitor for SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein, an important target for drug designing against this unprecedented challenge.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

32396903,Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and is responsible for the ongoing 2019-2020 pandemic.
32396903,Venous thromboembolism (VTE), a frequent cardiovascular and/or respiratory complication among hospitalized patients, is one of the known sequelae of the illness.
32396903,Hospitalized COVID-19 patients are often elderly, immobile, and show signs of coagulopathy.
32396903,Therefore, it is reasonable to assume a high incidence of VTE among these patients.
32396903,Presently, the incidence of VTE is estimated at around 25% of patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit for COVID-19 even under anticoagulant treatment at prophylactic doses.
32396903,In this review, we discuss present knowledge of the topic, the unique challenges of diagnosis and treatment of VTE, as well as some of the potential mechanisms of increased risk for VTE during the illness.
32396903,Understanding the true impact of VTE on patients with COVID-19 will potentially improve our ability to reach a timely diagnosis and initiate proper treatment, mitigating the risk for this susceptible population during a complicated disease.
32396985,Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) represents a global public health emergency, recently taken on pandemic proportions, with over 2.7 million confirmed cases worldwide(1).
32396985,Children/young adults seem to have a less severe clinical manifestation of COVID-19 (2), but data on disease susceptibility in pediatric transplant recipients on chronic immunosuppressive therapy are limited (3, 4).
32396985,This poses major uncertainties regarding pediatric transplant activity and management of anti-rejection therapy.
32396996,As a zoonotic disease that has already spread globally to several million human beings and possibly to domestic and wild animals, eradication of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) appears practically impossible.
32396996,There is a pressing need to improve our understanding of the immunology of this disease to contain the pandemic by developing vaccines and medicines for the prevention and treatment of patients.
32396996,In this review, we aim to improve our understanding on the immune response and immunopathological changes in patients linked to detoriating clinical conditions such as, cytokine storm, acute respiratory distress syndrome, autopsy findings and changes in acute phase reactants and serum biochemistry in COVID-19.
32396996,Similar to many other viral infections, asymptomatic disease is present in a significant but currently unknown fraction of the affected individuals.In the majority of the patients, a one-week, self-limiting viral respiratory disease typically occurs, which ends with the development of neutralizing anti-viral T cell and antibody immunity.
32396996,The IgM, IgA and IgG type virus-specific antibodies levels are important measurements to predict population immunity against this disease and whether cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses is taking place.High viral-load during the first infection and repeated exposure to virus especially in healthcare workers can be an important factor for severity of disease.
32396996,It should be noted that many aspects of severe patients are unique to COVID-19 and are rarely observed in other respiratory viral infections, such as severe lymphopenia and eosinopenia, extensive pneumonia and lung tissue damage, a cytokine storm leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan failure.
32396996,Lymphopenia causes a defect in antiviral and immune regulatory immunity.
32396996,At the same time, a cytokine storm starts with extensive activation of cytokine-secreting cells with innate and adaptive immune mechanisms both of with contribute to a poor prognosis.
32396996,Elevated levels of acute phase reactants and lymphopenia are early predictors of high disease severity.
32396996,Prevention of development to severe disease, cytokine storm, acute respiratory distress syndrome and novel approachs to prevent their development will be main routes for future research areas.
32396996,As we learn to live amidst the virus, understanding the immunology of the disease can assist in containing the pandemic and in developing vaccines and medicines to prevent and treat individual patients.
32397000,On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a pandemic.
32397000,Recently, Hermans, et.al., outlined the challenges the COVID-19 pandemic pose for the bleeding disorders community <sup>1</sup> .
32397000,The general response to the pandemic has included increased measures focused on personal hygiene, social distancing, symptom monitoring, early diagnosis, patient isolation, shelter in place, and public health quarantine.
32397000,Accordingly, such measures have led to concerns over how to maintain access to haemophilia treatment products and to the specialized integrated care medical follow up within the haemophilia treatment centers (HTCs).
32397000,As part of the medical response to disasters such as a world-wide pandemic, telemedicine has emerged as one proposed solution to address this type of global challenge <sup>2</sup> .
32397174,On 7 January 2020, researchers isolated and sequenced in China from patients with severe pneumonitis a novel coronavirus, then called SARS-CoV-2, which rapidly spread worldwide, becoming a global health emergency.
32397174,Typical manifestations consist of flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and dyspnea.
32397174,However, in about 20% of patients, the infection progresses to severe interstitial pneumonia and can induce an uncontrolled host-immune response, leading to a life-threatening condition called cytokine release syndrome (CRS).
32397174,CRS represents an emergency scenario of a frequent challenge, which is the complex and interwoven link between infections and autoimmunity.
32397174,Indeed, treatment of CRS involves the use of both antivirals to control the underlying infection and immunosuppressive agents to dampen the aberrant pro-inflammatory response of the host.
32397174,Several trials, evaluating the safety and effectiveness of immunosuppressants commonly used in rheumatic diseases, are ongoing in patients with COVID-19 and CRS, some of which are achieving promising results.
32397174,However, such a use should follow a multidisciplinary approach, be accompanied by close monitoring, be tailored to patient's clinical and serological features, and be initiated at the right time to reach the best results.
32397174,Autoimmune patients receiving immunosuppressants could be prone to SARS-CoV-2 infections; however, suspension of the ongoing therapy is contraindicated to avoid disease flares and a consequent increase in the infection risk.
32397399,<b>Objective:</b> This study aimed to assess the role of Tocilizumab therapy (TCZ) in terms of ICU admission and mortality rate of critically ill patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. <b>Design:</b> Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were prospectively enrolled in SMAtteo COvid19 REgistry (SMACORE).
32397399,A retrospective analysis of patients treated with TCZ matched using propensity score to patients treated with Standard Of Care (SOC) was conducted. <b>Setting:</b> The study was conducted at IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Hospital, Pavia, Italy, from March 14, 2020 to March 27, 2020. <b>Participants:</b> Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 hospitalized in our institution at the time of TCZ availability. <b>Interventions:</b> TCZ was administered to 21 patients.
32397399,The first administration was 8 mg/kg (up to a maximum 800 mg per dose) of Tocilizumab intravenously, repeated after 12 h if no side effects were reported after the first dose. <b>Main Outcomes and Measures:</b> ICU admission and 7-day mortality rate.
32397399,Secondary outcomes included clinical and laboratory data. <b>Results:</b> There were 112 patients evaluated (82 were male and 30 were female, with a median age of 63.55 years).
32397399,Using propensity scores, the 21 patients who received TCZ were matched to 21 patients who received SOC (a combination of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and prophylactic dose of low weight heparin).
32397399,No adverse event was detected following TCZ administration.
32397399,This study found that treatment with TCZ did not significantly affect ICU admission (OR 0.11; 95% CI between 0.00 and 3.38; p = 0.22) or 7-day mortality rate (OR 0.78; 95% CI between 0.06 and 9.34; p = 0.84) when compared with SOC.
32397399,Analysis of laboratory measures showed significant interactions between time and treatment regarding C-Reactive Protein (CRP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), platelets and international normalized ratio (INR) levels.
32397399,Variation in lymphocytes count was observed over time, irrespective of treatment. <b>Conclusions:</b> TCZ administration did not reduce ICU admission or mortality rate in a cohort of 21 patients.
32397399,Additional data are needed to understand the effect(s) of TCZ in treating patients diagnosed with COVID-19.
32397684,The current pandemic coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, is a global health emergency because of its highly contagious nature, the great number of patients requiring intensive care therapy, and the high fatality rate.
32397684,In the absence of specific antiviral drugs, passive prophylaxis, or a vaccine, the treatment aim in these patients is to prevent the potent virus-induced inflammatory stimuli from leading to the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which has a severe prognosis.
32397684,Here, the mechanism of action and the rationale for employing immunological strategies, which range from traditional chemically synthesized drugs, anti-cytokine antibodies, human immunoglobulin for intravenous use, to vaccines, are reviewed.
32397688,The COVID-19 pandemic is due to infection caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus that impacts the lower respiratory tract.
32397688,The spectrum of symptoms ranges from asymptomatic infections to mild respiratory symptoms to the lethal form of COVID-19 which is associated with severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress, and fatality.
32397688,To address this global crisis, up-to-date information on viral genomics and transcriptomics is crucial for understanding the origins and global dispersion of the virus, providing insights into viral pathogenicity, transmission, and epidemiology, and enabling strategies for therapeutic interventions, drug discovery, and vaccine development.
32397688,Therefore, this review provides a comprehensive overview of COVID-19 epidemiology, genomic etiology, findings from recent transcriptomic map analysis, viral-human protein interactions, molecular diagnostics, and the current status of vaccine and novel therapeutic intervention development.
32397688,Moreover, we provide an extensive list of resources that will help the scientific community access numerous types of databases related to SARS-CoV-2 OMICs and approaches to therapeutics related to COVID-19 treatment.
32397940,The SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of COVID-19 pandemic that is causing a global health emergency.
32397940,The lack of targeted therapeutics and limited treatment options have triggered the scientific community to develop new vaccines or small molecule therapeutics against various targets of SARS-CoV-2.
32397940,The main protease (Mpro) is a well characterized and attractive drug target because of its crucial role in processing of the polyproteins which are required for viral replication.
32397940,In order to provide potential lead molecules against the Mpro for clinical use, we docked a set of 65 bioactive molecules of Tea plant followed by exploration of the vast conformational space of protein-ligand complexes by long term molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (1.50 µs).
32397940,Top three bioactive molecules (Oolonghomobisflavan-A, Theasinensin-D, and Theaflavin-3-O-gallate) were selected by comparing their docking scores with repurposed drugs (Atazanavir, Darunavir, and Lopinavir) against SARS-CoV-2.
32397940,Oolonghomobisflavan-A molecule showed a good number of hydrogen bonds with Mpro and higher MM-PBSA binding energy when compared to all three repurposed drug molecules. during the time of simulation.
32397940,This study showed Oolonghomobisflavan-A as a potential bioactive molecule to act as an inhibitor for the Mpro of SARS-CoV-2.

32398164,The very limited time allowed to face the COVID-19 pandemic poses a pressing challenge to find proper therapeutic approaches.
32398164,However, synthesis and full investigation from preclinical studies to phase III trials of new medications is a time-consuming procedure, and not viable in a global emergency, such as the one we are facing.
32398164,Drug repurposing/repositioning, a strategy effectively employed in cancer treatment, can represent a valid alternative.
32398164,Most drugs considered for repurposing/repositioning in the therapy of the COVID-19 outbreak are commercially available and their dosage and toxicity in humans is well known, due to years (or even decades) of clinical use.
32398164,This can allow their fast-track evaluation in phase II-III clinical trials, or even within straightforward compassionate use.
32398164,Several drugs being re-considered for COVID-19 therapy are or have been used in cancer therapy.
32398164,Indeed, virus-infected cells are pushed to enhance the synthesis of nucleic acids, protein and lipid synthesis and boost their energy metabolism, in order to comply to the &quot;viral program&quot;.
32398164,Indeed, the same features are seen in cancer cells, making it likely that drugs interfering with specific cancer cell pathways may be effective as well in defeating viral replication.
32398164,To our knowledge, cancer drugs potentially suitable for facing SARS-CoV-2 infection have not been carefully reviewed.
32398164,We present here a comprehensive analysis of available information on potential candidate cancer drugs that can be repurposed for the treatment of COIVD-19.
32398243,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to dramatic changes in oncology practice.
32398243,It is currently unknown whether PD-1 blockade therapy impacts severity of illness from COVID-19 in patients with cancer.
32398243,To address this uncertainty, we examined consecutive patients with lung cancers who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and examined severity based on no or prior receipt of PD-1 blockade.
32398243,Overall, the severity of COVID-19 in patients with lung cancer was high, including need for hospitalization in more than half of patients and death in nearly a quarter.
32398243,Prior PD-1 blockade was, as expected, associated with smoking status.
32398243,After adjustment for smoking status, PD-1 blockade exposure was not associated with increased risk of severity of COVID-19.
32398243,PD-1 blockade does not appear to impact the severity of COVID-19 in patients with lung cancers.
32398268,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32398268,Pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are the most common severe complications.
32398268,There is growing evidence regarding the imaging findings of COVID-19 in chest X-rays and computed tomography (CT) scans; however, their availability to clinical staff in this pandemic outbreak might be compromised.
32398268,At this moment, the role of lung ultrasound (LUS) has yet to be explored.
32398268,The purpose of this case report is to describe the natural course of the disease in mild infection managed at home.
32398268,We report a 35-year-old man with recently diagnosed COVID-19 infection.
32398268,Clinical examination was unremarkable.
32398268,The diagnosis of mild disease was made clinically which was later reaffirmed by LUS after identifying a bilateral small pleural effusion and a thickened pleural line.
32398268,During follow up, subpleural consolidations appeared before symptoms slightly aggravated (cough, tiredness and fever).
32398268,The patient's condition improved after adjustment of therapy at home.
32398268,LUS is an excellent tool in the characterisation of COVID-19 infection and is more available than CT or X-ray.
32398268,We emphasise the utility and the opportunity that LUS presents in some clinical scenarios, like this COVID-19 pandemic, and how it may serve as a monitoring and therapy guide.
32398343,There are no established effective treatments for COVID-19.
32398343,While novel drugs are being developed, azithromycin has been identified as a candidate treatment in the interim.
32398343,To review the evidence for the effectiveness and safety of azithromycin in treating COVID-19.
32398343,A rapid review of the literature was conducted.
32398343,Electronic searches were conducted on 16 April 2020 of PubMed, TRIP, EPPI COVID Living Map, MedRxiv, GoogleScholar, and Google.
32398343,In vivo and in vitro studies were included assessing the safety and effectiveness of azithromycin for treatment of COVID-19, and/or the activity of azithromycin against SARS-CoV-2.
32398343,In vivo studies needed to include a comparator group.
32398343,Three studies were identified, two in vitro and one in vivo, which were suitable for inclusion.
32398343,All three were published as pre-prints.
32398343,The in vitro studies revealed conflicting results, with one finding anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity for azithromycin alone, while the other found activity against SARS-CoV-2 only when azithromycin was combined with hydroxychloroquine.
32398343,A small trial of 36 patients, with high risk of bias, found superior viral clearance in patients with COVID-19 treated with azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine combined, compared with hydroxychloroquine alone.
32398343,There is no evidence to support the use of azithromycin for the treatment of COVID-19 outside of the context of clinical trials, unless it is used to treat bacterial super-infection.
32398343,There is extremely limited evidence of a possible synergy between azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine.
32398343,The adverse events profile of azithromycin in the context of COVID-19 has not yet been established.
32398343,Well-conducted clinical trials are urgently needed in this area.
32398383,Recommendations of the Main Board of the Polish Society of Otorhinolaryngologists, Head and Neck Surgeons for providing services during the COVID-19 pandemic constitute the guidance to outpatient and hospital practices in all cases where contact with a patient whose status of COVID-19 is unknown.
32398383,They have been created based on world publications and recommendations due to the current state of the COVID-19 pandemic.
32398383,Justification for suspension of planned provision of services in the first phase of a pandemic was presented.
32398383,The indication of the best medical practices for the time of stabilization, but with the persistence of the risk of COVID-19 infection in the population are discussed.
32398383,The possibility of providing services in the following months of the pandemic is important.
32398383,We provide the rationale for launching medical activities and indicate optimal practices until the consolidation of SARS COV-2 prevention and treatment methods.
32398569,The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has spread rapidly across the globe.
32398569,In contrast to initial reports, recent studies suggest that children are just as likely as adults to become infected with the virus but have fewer symptoms and less severe disease.
32398569,In this review, we summarize the epidemiologic and clinical features of children infected with SARS-CoV-2 reported in pediatric case series to date.
32398569,We also summarize the perinatal outcomes of neonates born to women infected with SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy.
32398569,We found 11 case series including a total of 333 infants and children.
32398569,Overall, 83% of the children had a positive contact history, mostly with family members.
32398569,The incubation period varied between 2 and 25 days with a mean of 7 days.
32398569,The virus could be isolated from nasopharyngeal secretions for up to 22 days and from stool for more than 30 days.
32398569,Co-infections were reported in up to 79% of children (mainly mycoplasma and influenza).
32398569,Up to 35% of children were asymptomatic.
32398569,The most common symptoms were cough (48%; range 19%-100%), fever (42%; 11%-100%) and pharyngitis (30%; 11%-100%).
32398569,Further symptoms were nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, tachypnoea, wheezing, diarrhea, vomiting, headache and fatigue.
32398569,Laboratory test parameters were only minimally altered.
32398569,Radiologic findings were unspecific and included unilateral or bilateral infiltrates with, in some cases, ground-glass opacities or consolidation with a surrounding halo sign.
32398569,Children rarely needed admission to intensive care units (3%), and to date, only a small number of deaths have been reported in children globally.
32398569,Nine case series and 2 case reports described outcomes of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy in 65 women and 67 neonates.
32398569,Two mothers (3%) were admitted to intensive care unit.
32398569,Fetal distress was reported in 30% of pregnancies.
32398569,Thirty-seven percent of women delivered preterm.
32398569,Neonatal complications included respiratory distress or pneumonia (18%), disseminated intravascular coagulation (3%), asphyxia (2%) and 2 perinatal deaths.
32398569,Four neonates (3 with pneumonia) have been reported to be SARS-CoV-2 positive despite strict infection control and prevention procedures during delivery and separation of mother and neonates, meaning vertical transmission could not be excluded.
32398607,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has forced a redesign of healthcare services.
32398607,Resource reallocation will have consequences on the routine management of chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease (CVD).
32398607,We consider how to mitigate potential adverse effects.
32398607,Combination therapy is well established in hypertension.
32398607,Many guidelines recommend dual antihypertensive therapy as the initial treatment step as this results in faster blood pressure control, albeit with limited evidence of improved outcomes.
32398607,Control of CVD risk factors through multiclass combination therapy (the polypill) was proposed many years ago.
32398607,This approach has not been adopted by Western healthcare systems despite improving surrogate outcomes.
32398607,Recently, the PolyIran trials have demonstrated improved CVD outcomes without increased adverse events, in both primary and secondary prevention.
32398607,The COVID-19 pandemic allows models of chronic healthcare to be rethought.
32398607,Current practices are resource-intensive and there is a need to simplify titration and monitoring protocols in CVD.
32398607,Moving toward the use of polypill combinations allied with telehealth consultations may be one solution.
32398876,Here, we describe a serological enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the screening and identification of human SARS-CoV-2 seroconverters.
32398876,This assay does not require the handling of infectious virus, can be adjusted to detect different antibody types in serum and plasma and is amenable to scaling.
32398876,Serological assays are of critical importance to help define previous exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in populations, identify highly reactive human donors for convalescent plasma therapy and investigate correlates of protection.
32398901,The phenomenal speed of COVID-19 has subjected the public health professionals worldwide to struggle to subdue the spread of the disease and its impact of the affected societies.
32398901,The limited biomedical and epidemiological understanding of COVID-19 along with the lack of vaccines and therapeutics have led to the reception of draconian measures from the societal safety domain, limiting human interaction through social distancing.
32398901,Grounded on the adopted approaches, interventions in sero-prevalence studies, mobilisation of the primary health care (PHC) sector, as well as target socially vulnerable groups should be taken into consideration by heath authorities.
32398902,The detection of first COVID-19 infected industrial worker in Vietnam on 13 April 2020 prompted timely effort to examine the health problems, behaviors, and health services access of industrial workers to inform effective and appropriate COVID-19 control measures, minimizing the risk of industrial sites becoming the next disease cluster.
32398902,A search strategy involving search terms corresponding to 'health', 'industrial worker', and 'Vietnam' was applied to search for related papers published in English on Web of Science, PubMed, and Google Scholar.
32398902,Duplicates were removed, and relevant data were extracted from the full text of remaining publications.
32398902,Results showed that underlying health problems, including respiratory system problems, were common among industrial workers.
32398902,Many suffered occupational diseases and/or work-related injuries.
32398902,Self-treatment (without medication) was the most used method when having health problems (by 28.2% to 51% of participants), followed by visiting commune health centers (24%) and self-medication (20.3%).
32398902,Findings suggest a high risk of disease spreading among industrial workers and of them suffering more severe conditions when infected.
32398902,Economic vulnerabilities may be the reason for workers' reluctance to taking time off work to attend hospital/clinic.
32398902,These imply a need for involving local pharmacies, commune health centers, traditional health providers or village health collaborators as local health gatekeepers who are the first point of detecting and reporting of suspected COVID-19 cases, as well as a channel where accurate information regarding COVID-19, protective equipment, and intervention packages can be delivered.
32398902,Having COVID-19 testing centers at or near industrial sites are also recommended.
32398954,Coronavirus (CoV) has been one of the major pandemic threats to human health in the last two decades.
32398954,The human coronavirus was first identified in 1960s.
32398954,CoVs 229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV have caused numerous disasters or human deaths worldwide.
32398954,Recently, an outbreak of the previously unknown deadly CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV 2 (SARS-CoV-2, early named 2019-nCoV) occurred in Wuhan, China, and it had caused 81238 cases of confirmed infection, including 3250 deaths until March 19, 2020.
32398954,Its risks and pandemic potential have brought global consideration.
32398954,We summarized epidemiology, virological characteristics, clinical symptoms, diagnostic methods, clinical treatments, and prevention methods for COVID-19 to present a reference for the future wave of probable CoV outbreaks.
32399449,Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is a worldwide infection which was recently declared a global health emergency by the WHO Emergency Committee.
32399449,The most common symptoms are fever and cough, which can progress to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and/or end-organ failure.
32399449,Risk factors associated with ARDS and death are older age, comorbidities (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia), neutrophilia, and organ and coagulation dysfunction.
32399449,Disseminated intravascular coagulation and coagulopathy can contribute to death.
32399449,Anticoagulant treatment is associated with decreased mortality in severe COVID-19 pneumonia.
32399449,In this report we describe two patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who developed venous thromboembolism.
32399449,Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism can occur in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.Low-molecular-weight heparin prophylaxis does not decrease the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in COVID-19 pneumonia.In the presence of clinical signs and/or suspicion of VTE, compression ultrasound and echocardiography should be always performed, irrespective of disease stage.
32399452,COVID-19, also called severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), originated in Wuhan, China.
32399452,It has caused significant morbidity and mortality worldwide and has been declared a global pandemic by the WHO.
32399452,Influenza occurs mainly during the winter, with the burden of disease determined by several factors, including the effectiveness of the vaccine that season, the characteristics of the circulating viruses, and how long the season lasts.
32399452,We describe the case of a 66-year-old woman who was diagnosed with influenza A and COVID-19 co-infection.
32399452,COVID-19 can co-occur with other viral infections.Some of these co-infections have active treatments, while supportive treatment is the mainstay of treatment for others.
32399455,Younger patients with COVID-19 may experience an exaggerated immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and develop cytokine release syndrome (CRS), which may be life threatening.
32399455,There is no proven antiviral therapy for COVID-19 so far, but profound immunosuppression has recently been suggested as a treatment for COVID-19-associated CRS.
32399455,We present a case of life-threatening CRS caused by COVID-19 infection with a favourable response to immunosuppressive therapy with tocilizumab (TCZ).
32399455,The rapid clinical and biochemical improvement following TCZ administration suggests that treatment with immunotherapy can be life-saving in selected patients with COVID-19-induced CRS.
32399455,Cytokine release syndrome may cause sudden and potentially life-threatening clinical deterioration in COVID-19 pneumonia, particularly in younger patients.Immunosuppressive therapy may provide important additional therapeutic benefit in these patients.Tocilizumab, a specific IL-6 inhibitor, led to dramatic clinical improvement in a young patient with severe COVID-19-associated cytokine release syndrome.
32399457,Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32399457,We describe the case of a 59-year-old man who presented with headache, hypertension and a single episode of fever with no other symptoms.
32399457,He subsequently developed unilateral weakness.
32399457,Computer tomography identified a cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST).
32399457,A subsequent test for COVID-19 was positive.
32399457,This is the first report of CVST as a presenting symptom of COVID-19 infection.
32399457,Thrombotic events may be the initial presenting symptom of COVID-19.
32399457,These thrombotic events include stroke, venous thromboembolism, pulmonary embolism and cardiac complications.Clinicians should carefully consider the risk of thrombosis in patients positive for COVID-19, including prophylaxis and treatment beyond discharge.
32399481,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is mainly characterized by pulmonary inflammation.
32399481,The preferred imaging modality is chest computed tomography (CT) which plays an important role in early diagnosis, quarantine, and treatment as well as in the evaluation of therapeutic efficacy.
32399481,We report the imaging data from a confirmed case of COVID-19 admitted to our hospital.
32399481,Our aims are to improve understanding of this disease and to facilitate early diagnosis and evaluation of therapeutic efficacy.
32399481,A 70-year-old woman living in the epidemic area presented with a 2-day history of intermittent fever.
32399481,Chest CT revealed multiple ground glass opacities in both lungs, mainly distributed subpleurally and in the middle and lateral lung fields, particularly in the right lung, where they had partially fused into patches.
32399481,Local interlobular septal thickening was also observed.
32399481,Throat swabs were positive for the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, which confirmed the diagnosis of COVID-19.
32399481,Chest CT plays a key role in the diagnosis of COVID-19, providing an accurate diagnosis and is a sensitive technique for evaluation of therapeutic efficacy.
32399481,It has the advantages of promptness, convenience, and high efficiency.
32399620,To quantify the severity of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on chest CT and to determine its relationship with laboratory parameters.
32399620,Patients with real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed COVID-19 between January 01 and February 18, 2020, were included in this study.
32399620,Laboratory parameters were retrospectively collected from medical records.
32399620,Severity of lung changes on chest CT of early, progressive, peak, and absorption stages was scored according to the percentage of lung involvement (5 lobes, scores 1-5 for each lobe, range 0-20).
32399620,Relationship between CT scores and laboratory parameters was evaluated by the Spearman rank correlation.
32399620,The Bonferroni correction adjusted significance level was at 0.05/4 = 0.0125.
32399620,A total of 84 patients (mean age, 47.8 ± 12.0 years [standard deviation]; age range, 24-80 years) were evaluated.
32399620,The patients underwent a total of 339 chest CT scans with a median interval of 4 days (interquartile range, 3-5 days).
32399620,Median chest CT scores peaked at 4 days after the beginning of treatment and then declined.
32399620,CT score of the early stage was correlated with neutrophil count (r = 0.531, P = 0.011).
32399620,CT score of the progressive stage was correlated with neutrophil count (r = 0.502, P &lt; 0.001), white blood cell count (r = 0.414, P = 0.001), C-reactive protein (r = 0.511, P &lt; 0.001), procalcitonin (r = 0.423, P = 0.004), and lactose dehydrogenase (r = 0.369, P = 0.010).
32399620,However, CT scores of the peak and absorption stages were not correlated with any parameter (P &gt; 0.0125).
32399620,No sex difference occurred regarding CT score (P &gt; 0.05).
32399620,Severity of lung abnormalities quantified on chest CT might correlate with laboratory parameters in the early and progressive stages.
32399620,However, larger cohort studies are necessary.
32399719,As a severe and highly contagious infectious disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a global pandemic.
32399719,Several case reports have demonstrated that the respiratory system is the main target in patients with COVID-19, but the disease is not limited to the respiratory system.
32399719,Case analysis indicated that the nervous system can be invaded by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and that 36.4% of COVID-19 patients had neurological symptoms.
32399719,Importantly, the involvement of the CNS may be associated with poor prognosis and disease worsening.
32399719,Here, we discussed the symptoms and evidence of nervous system involvement (directly and indirectly) caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection and possible mechanisms.
32399719,CNS symptoms could be a potential indicator of poor prognosis; therefore, the prevention and treatment of CNS symptoms are also crucial for the recovery of COVID-19 patients.
32399806,SARS-CoV-2 viruses are positive single-stranded RNA viruses, whose infection can be asymptomatic or lead to the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19).
32399806,Covid-19 is a respiratory infection with a significant impact on the hematopoietic system and hemostasis leading to several cardiovascular complications.
32399806,Hematologic consequences of this new infection allowed medical community to start new treatment approaches concerning infection going from targeted anti-inflammatory drugs to anticoagulation or stem cell therapies.
32399806,A better understanding of Covid-19 pathophysiology, in particular hematological disorders, will help to choose appropriate treatment strategies.
32399942,The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 is unprecedented in modern history.
32399942,Its effects on social behavior and health care delivery have been dramatic.
32399942,The resultant burden of disease and critical illness has outpaced the diagnostic, therapeutic, and health care professional resources of many clinics and hospitals.
32399942,It continues to do so globally.
32399942,The allocation of hospital beds and ventilators, personal protective equipment, investigational therapeutics, and other scarce resources has required difficult decisions.
32399942,Clinical and surgical practices which are standard in normal times may not be standard or safe during the COVID-19 crisis.
32399942,How can we best adapt as physicians and surgeons?
32399942,What foundational ethical principles and systems of principle application can help guide our decision-making?
32399942,Fortunately, a large body of work in medical ethics addresses these questions.
32399942,Unfortunately, many surgeons and other health care professionals are probably not as familiar with these concepts.
32399942,This brief communication is intended to provide a concise explanation of ethical considerations which readers may find helpful when addressing allocation of scarce resources and alterations in surgical care brought on by the current pandemic.
32399995,To date, no study attempted to quantify the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on incidence and treatment of acute stroke.
32399995,Retrospective review of acute stroke pathway parameters in all three stroke units in the Alsace region during the first month of the outbreak (1-31 March 2020), using the similar period from 2019 as a comparator.
32399995,A secondary detailed analysis of all stroke alerts and stroke unit admissions was performed in the center with the largest case volume.
32399995,Compared to the same period in 2019, in March 2020 there were 39.6% fewer stroke alerts and 33.3% fewer acute revascularization treatments (40.9% less intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) and 27.6% less mechanical thrombectomy (MT)).
32399995,No marked variation was observed in the number of stroke unit admissions (-0.6%).
32399995,The proportion of patients with acute revascularization treatments (IVT or MT) out of the total number of stroke unit admissions was significantly lower in March 2020 (21.3%) compared to 2019 (31.8%), p=0.034.
32399995,There were no significant differences in time delays or severity of clinical symptoms for patients treated by IVT or MT, nor in the distribution of final diagnosis among stroke alerts and stroke unit admissions.
32399995,These results suggest overall incidence of stroke remained the same, but fewer patients presented within the therapeutic time window.
32399995,Increased public awareness and corrective measures are needed to mitigate the deleterious effects of the Covid-19 outbreak on acute stroke care.
32400017,For those who work in the field of islet transplantation, the micro vascular COVID-19 lung vessels obstructive thrombo-inflammatory syndrome (recently referred to as MicroCLOTS) is familiar, as one cannot fail to recognize the presence of similarities with the instant blood mediated inflammatory reaction (IBMIR) occurring in the liver hours and days after islet infusion.
32400017,Evidences in both MicroCLOTS and IBMIR suggest the involvement of the coagulation cascade and complement system activation, and proinflammatory chemokines/cytokines release.
32400017,Identification and targeting of pathway(s) playing a role as &quot;master regulator(s)&quot; in the post-islet transplant detrimental inflammatory events could be potentially useful to suggest innovative COVID-19 treatments and vice versa.
32400017,All the scientific organizations across the world are fighting the COVID-19 pandemic.
32400017,Islet transplantation, and more generally the transplantation scientific community, could contribute suggesting strategies for innovative approaches.
32400017,At the same time, in the near future, clinical trials in COVID-19 patients will produce an enormous quantity of clinical and translational data on the control of inflammation, and complement/microthrombosis activation.
32400017,These data will represent a legacy to be transformed into innovation in the transplant field.
32400017,It will be our contribution to change a dramatic event into advancement for the transplant field, and ultimately for our patients.
32400049,To report our initial experience of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)/acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients undergoing standard of care invasive management.
32400049,The rapid diffusion of the SARS-CoV-2 together with the need for isolation for infected patients might be responsible for a suboptimal treatment for SARS-CoV-2 ACS patients.
32400049,Recently, the group of Sichuan published a protocol for COVID/ACS infected patients that see the thrombolysis as the gold standard of care.
32400049,We enrolled 31 consecutive patients affected by SARS-COV-2 admitted to our emergencies room for suspected ACS.
32400049,All patients underwent urgent coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) when required except two patients with severe hypoxemia and unstable hemodynamic condition that were conservatively treated.
32400049,Twenty-one cases presented diffuse ST-segment depression while in the remaining cases anterior and inferior ST-elevation was present in four and six cases, respectively.
32400049,PCI was performed in all cases expect two that were diagnosed as suspected myocarditis because of the absence of severe coronary disease and three with apical ballooning at ventriculography diagnostic for Tako-Tsubo syndromes.
32400049,Two patients conservatively treated died.
32400049,The remaining patients undergoing PCI survived except one that required endotracheal intubation (ETI) and died at Day 6.
32400049,ETI was required in five more patients while in the remaining cases CPAP was used for respiratory support.
32400049,Urgent PCI for ACS is often required in SARS-CoV-2 patients improving the prognosis in all but the most advanced patients.
32400049,Complete patient history and examination, routine ECG monitoring, echocardiography, and careful evaluation of changes in cardiac enzymes should be part of the regular assessment procedures also in dedicated COVID positive units.
32400074,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been declared pandemic since March 2020.
32400074,In Europe, Italy has been the first nation affected by this infection.
32400074,In this paper we report anamnestic data, clinical features and therapeutic management of two lung transplant recipients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia.
32400074,Both patients were in good clinical conditions prior to the infection and were on immunosuppression with calcineurin inhibitors (CNI), mycophenolate mofetil and corticosteroids.
32400074,Whilst mycophenolate mofetil was withdrawn in both cases, CNI were suspended only in the second patient.
32400074,The first patient always maintained excellent oxygen saturation throughout hospitalization with no need for additional oxygen therapy.
32400074,He was discharged with a satisfactory pulmonary function and a complete resolution of radiological and clinical findings.
32400074,However, at discharge SARS-CoV-2 RNA could still be detected in the nasopharyngeal swab and in the stools.
32400074,The second patient required mechanical ventilation, had a progressive deterioration of his clinical conditions and had a fatal outcome.
32400074,Further insight into SARS-CoV-2 infection is eagerly awaited to improve the outcome transplant recipients affected by COVID-19 pneumonia.
32400084,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a world spreading health problem with pandemic character.
32400084,Lung transplant recipients may be particularly at risk due to the high degree of immunosupression and the lung being the organ primarily affected by COVID-19.
32400084,We describe a 16-year old male and a 64-year old female recently lung transplanted patients with COVID-19 during inpatient rehabilitation.
32400084,Both patients were on triple immunosuppressive therapy and had no signs of allograft dysfunction.
32400084,Both patients had close contact to a person who developed COVID-19 and were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.
32400084,Subsequently, both patients underwent systematic screening and SARS-CoV-2 was detected ultimately.
32400084,While the 16-year old boy was completely asymptomatic, the 64-year old woman developed only mild COVID-19.
32400084,Immunosuppressive therapy was unchanged and no experimental treatment was initiated.
32400084,No signs of graft involvement or dysfunction were noticed.
32400084,In conclusion, our report of patients with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and mild COVID-19 respectively, may indicate that lung transplant recipients are not per se at risk for severe COVID-19.
32400084,Further observations and controlled trials are urgently needed to study SARS-CoV-2 infection in lung transplant recipients.
32400099,COVID 19 pandemic is spreading worldwide and the impact of the disease in transplant patients is evolving.
32400099,In this case report, we presented a 63 years old female kidney transplant recipient who presented with dyspnea and cough and diagnosed with COVID 19 pneumonia.
32400099,On the 4<sup>th</sup> day of admission, the patient's condition worsened.
32400099,Therefore, the immunosuppressive medications were discontinued, and hydrocortisone started.
32400099,The patient died on the 5<sup>th</sup> day.
32400323,In December 2019, a new coronavirus, named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has emerged from China causing pneumonia outbreaks first in the Wuhan region and currently worldwide.
32400323,In the light of the lack of efficient and specific treatments and the need to contain the epidemic, drug repurposing appears to be the most efficient tool to find therapeutic solution.
32400323,The aim of this study was to summarize in vitro data of current agents used for the management of SARSCoV-2 all over the world.
32400323,A literature search of articles from January 2000 until April 2020 was performed using MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library to assess in vitro data of current or putative therapies for SARS-CoV-2.
32400323,Although in vitro studies are scarce, data regarding chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, nitazoxanide, teicoplanin, ivermectin, lopinavir, homoharringtonine and emetine seem promising.
32400323,Scientist all over the world should work together and increase their efforts in order to find feasible and efficient solutions against this new global viral threat.
32400362,Data on features of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in children and adolescents are scarce.
32400362,We report preliminary results of an Italian multicentre study comprising 168 laboratory-confirmed paediatric cases (median: 2.3 years, range: 1 day-17.7 years, 55.9% males), of which 67.9% were hospitalised and 19.6% had comorbidities.
32400362,Fever was the most common symptom, gastrointestinal manifestations were frequent; two children required intensive care, five had seizures, 49 received experimental treatments and all recovered.
32400380,The severity of COVID-19 disease has led to an urgent need for the discovery of new treatments.
32400380,Thus, global stocks of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have been put under pressure with a study of 26 patients treated with HCQ during their infection with SARS-CoV-2.
32400380,Despite the study's lack of quality, several countries' medicines agencies subsequently issued guidelines for the use of HCQ for COVID-19.
32400380,This review aims to elucidate potential mechanisms, which make HCQ treatment interesting in the fight against SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as the current evidence for clinical use of HCQ to treat COVID-19.
32400911,The global outbreak of COVID-19 has required mental health providers to rapidly rethink and how they provide care.
32400911,Cognitive processing therapy (CPT) is a trauma-focused, evidence-based treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder that is effective when delivered in-person or via telehealth.
32400911,Given current limitations on the provision of in-person mental health treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic, this article presents guidelines and treatment considerations when implementing CPT via telehealth.
32400911,Based on lessons learned from prior studies and clinical delivery of CPT via telehealth, recommendations are made with regard to overall strategies for adapting CPT to a telehealth format, including how to conduct routine assessments and ensure treatment fidelity.

32400924,The COVID-19 pandemic is one of the most serious global challenges to delivering affordable and equitable treatment to children with cancer we have witnessed in the last few decades.
32400924,This Special Report aims to summarize general principles for continuing multidisciplinary care during the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic.
32400924,With contributions from the leadership of the International Society for Pediatric Oncology (SIOP), Children's Oncology Group (COG), St Jude Global program, and Childhood Cancer International, we have sought to provide a framework for healthcare teams caring for children with cancer during the pandemic.
32400924,We anticipate the burden will fall particularly heavily on children, their families, and cancer services in low- and middle-income countries.
32400924,Therefore, we have brought together the relevant clinical leads from SIOP Europe, COG, and SIOP-PODC (Pediatric Oncology in Developing Countries) to focus on the six most curable cancers that are part of the WHO Global Initiative in Childhood Cancer.
32400924,We provide some practical advice for adapting diagnostic and treatment protocols for children with cancer during the pandemic, the measures taken to contain it (e.g., extreme social distancing), and how to prepare for the anticipated recovery period.
32400965,The ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) first reported in Wuhan has been declared global public health emergency and a pandemic by the World Health Organization.
32400965,Faced with this novel coronavirus, scientists have been trying to use drugs that have not been validated by rigorous clinical trials, such as lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ).
32400965,These drugs may be used tentatively for general population with COVID-19, but for solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients with long-term immunosuppressive therapy and drug-related metabolic diseases, antiviral drugs should be chosen with particular care.
32400965,Notably, the elderly SOT patients commonly suffer from liver and kidney dysfunction of varying degrees, resulting in worse drug metabolism.
32401064,Emerging infectious diseases, the persistent potential for destabilising pandemics, remain a global threat leading to excessive morbidity and mortality.
32401064,The current outbreak of pneumonia caused by 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) illustrated difficulties in lack of effective drugs for treatment.
32401064,Accurate and rapid diagnostic tools are essential for early recognition and treatment of infectious diseases, allowing timely implementation of infection control, improved clinical care and other public health measures to stop the spread of the disease.
32401064,CRISPR-Cas technology speed up the development of infectious disease diagnostics with high rapid and accurate.
32401064,In this review, we summarise current advance regarding diverse CRISPR-Cas systems, including CRISPR-Cas9, CRISPR-Cas12 and CRISPR-Cas13, in the development of fast, accurate and portable diagnostic tests and highlight the potential of CRISPR-Cas13 in COVID-19 Pneumonia and other emerging infectious diseases diagnosis.
32401359,COVID-19 has become a global health concern.
32401359,HIV-infected patients are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 due to their immune-compromised status.
32401359,The clinical manifestations and clinical outcomes of these patients are not clear.
32401359,In this report, we presented two special COVID-19 patients with HIV infection and other comorbidities.
32401359,We described the clinical characteristics, clinical manifestations, treatments and clinical outcomes of both patients.
32401359,One patient with prior HIV-infection continued anti-HIV treatment when diagnosed with COVID-19.
32401359,The other patient was newly diagnosed with HIV-infection when diagnosed with COVID-19 and had not begun anti-HIV treatment.
32401359,Both patients were treated with anti-viral, antibiotics, oxygen treatment and supportive care and recovered from severe pneumonia.
32401359,The experience of these two cases suggested that COVID-19 patients with HIV infection could still have satisfactory clinical outcomes following proper medical care.

32401360,A pandemic coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, causes COVID-19, a potentially life-threatening respiratory disease.
32401360,Patients with cancer may have compromised immunity due to their malignancy and/or treatment, and may be at elevated risk of severe COVID-19.
32401360,Community transmission of COVID-19 could overwhelm health care services, compromising delivery of cancer care.
32401360,This interim consensus guidance provides advice for clinicians managing patients with cancer during the pandemic.
32401360,During the COVID-19 pandemic: In patients with cancer with fever and/or respiratory symptoms, consider causes in addition to COVID-19, including other infections and therapy-related pneumonitis.
32401360,For suspected or confirmed COVID-19, discuss temporary cessation of cancer therapy with a relevant specialist.
32401360,Provide information on COVID-19 for patients and carers.
32401360,Adopt measures within cancer centres to reduce risk of nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 acquisition; support population-wide social distancing; reduce demand on acute services; ensure adequate staffing; and provide culturally safe care.
32401360,Measures should be equitable, transparent and proportionate to the COVID-19 threat.
32401360,Consider the risks and benefits of modifying cancer therapies due to COVID-19.
32401360,Communicate treatment modifications, and review once health service capacity allows.
32401360,Consider potential impacts of COVID-19 on the blood supply and availability of stem cell donors.
32401360,Discuss and document goals of care, and involve palliative care services in contingency planning.
32401360,This interim consensus guidance provides a framework for clinicians managing patients with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32401360,In view of the rapidly changing situation, clinicians must also monitor national, state, local and institutional policies, which will take precedence.

32401361,This study aims to observe the clinical characteristics of recovered patients from Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID 19) with positive in RT-PCR or serum antibody.
32401361,The profile, clinical symptoms, laboratory outcomes and radiologic assessments were extracted on 11 patients, who tested positive for COVID-19 with RT-PCR or serum antibody after discharged and was admitted to Hubei No.
32401361,3 People's Hospital of Jianghan University for a second treatment in March 2020.
32401361,The average interval time between the first discharge and the second admission measured 16.00 ± 7.14 days, ranging from 6 to 27 days.
32401361,In the second hospitalization, 1 patient was positive for RT-PCR and serum antibody IgM-IgG, 5 patients were positive for both IgM and IgG but negative for RT-PCR. 3 patients were positive for both RT-PCR and IgG but negative for IgM.
32401361,The main symptoms were cough (54.5%), fever (27.3%) and feeble (27.3%) in the second hospitalization.
32401361,Compared with the first hospitalization, there were significant decreases in gastrointestinal symptoms (5 vs.
32401361,0, P=0.035), elevated levels of both white blood cell count(P=0.036) and lymphocyte count (P=0.002), remarkedly decreases in CRP and SAA (P&lt;0.05) in the second hospitalization.
32401361,Additionally, 6 patients' chest CT exhibited notable improvements in acute exudative lesions CONCLUSION: There could be the positive results for RT-PCR analysis or serum IgM-IgG in discharged patients, even with mild clinical symptoms, however, their laboratory outcomes and chest CT images would not indicate the on-going development in those patients.

32401373,World Health Organization declared on 11 March, COVID 19 as a pandemic infection that has spread rapidly across the globe.
32401373,Covid-19 currently has no known treatment or a vaccine.
32401373,Oral health professionals are at risk of developing COVID 19 infection as they come into close contact with patients and accompanying relatives who may be carrying the virus.
32401373,Since January 2020, and by the end of April this year, more than 150 medical doctors in Italy and over 100 National Health Service workers in the UK have died in the COVID-19 crisis.
32401373,While the transmission of COVID 19 via human ex-haled droplets and direct contact is clear, the potential for aerosol transmission is a significant risk particularly for dental practices.
32401373,The objective of this brief review is to highlight ways how dental manpower could protect from the spread of disease.
32401405,The antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has long been used as a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug for the treatment of several inflammatory rheumatic diseases.
32401405,Over the last three decades, various studies have shown that HCQ plays also a role in the regulation of glucose homeostasis.
32401405,Although the mechanisms of action underlying the glucose-lowering properties of HCQ are still not entirely clear, evidence suggests that this drug may exert multifaceted effects on glucose regulation, including improvement of insulin sensitivity, increase of insulin secretion, reduction of hepatic insulin clearance and reduction of systemic inflammation.
32401405,Preliminary studies have shown the safety and efficacy of HCQ (at a dose ranging from 400 to 600 mg/day) in patients with type 2 diabetes over a short-term period.
32401405,In 2014, HCQ has been approved in India as an add-on hypoglycemic agent for patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes.
32401405,However, large randomized controlled trials are needed to establish the safety and efficacy profile of HCQ in patients with type 2 diabetes over a long-term period.
32401405,With regard to the COVID-19 pandemic, several medications (including HCQ) have been used as off-label drugs due to the lack of proven effective therapies.
32401405,However, emerging evidence shows limited benefit from HCQ use in COVID-19 in general.
32401405,The aim of this manuscript is to comprehensively summarize the current knowledge on the antihyperglycemic properties of HCQ and to critically evaluate the potential risks and benefits related to HCQ use in patients with diabetes, even in light of the current pandemic scenario.

32401442,ACE2 is not only an enzyme that counters the effects of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) but is also the entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2, the virus of the Covid-19 pandemic.
32401442,Some experimental data suggest that ACE inhibitors and ARBs increase ACE2 levels, thus raising concerns on their security in Covid-19 positive patients.
32401442,However, some studies have shown protection by these drugs in lower tract respiratory infections and ARDS.
32401442,The actual consensus is to continue the treatment with RAAS inhibitors, abrupt withdrawal, especially in patients with cardiac or renal conditions, being hazardous in terms of cardiovascular outcomes, except in patients hospitalized in intensive care with hemodynamic instability.
32401442,This position statement is actually unanimous among all international learned societies.
32401442,L’enzyme de conversion de l’angiotensine ACE2 est le récepteur membranaire du virus SARS-CoV-2, permettant son entrée dans les cellules cibles.
32401442,ACE2 est également une enzyme qui contrebalance les effets de l’axe classique angiotensine II et récepteur AT1 du système rénine-angiotensine.
32401442,Cette double fonction a suscité des craintes par rapport à une augmentation du risque d’infection ou de complications chez les patient·es traité·es par cette classe d’antihypertenseurs.
32401442,Toutefois il existe des arguments opposés faisant penser que ces médicaments seraient plutôt protecteurs dans certaines affections pulmonaires virales aiguës.
32401442,Le consensus actuel est de ne pas interrompre ces médications, sauf chez les patient·es hospitalisé·es hémodynamiquement instables, au vu du danger d’une suspension brutale en cas de pathologie cardiaque ou rénale.
32401611,We are proposingÂ the use of pulmonary-proteoliposome as a new therapeutic approach for Coronaviruses.
32401611,The designed strategy represents a potential treatment to reduce the overall viral load in the lungs and to help the immune system to successfully stave off the infection.
32401686,Cancer has become a prevalent disease, affecting millions of new patients globally each year.
32401686,The COVID-19 pandemic is having far-reaching impacts around the world, causing substantial disruptions to health and health care systems that are likely to last for a prolonged period.
32401686,Early data have suggested that having cancer is a significant risk factor for mortality from severe COVID-19.
32401686,A diverse group of medical oncologists met to formulate detailed practical advice on systemic anticancer treatments during this crisis.
32401686,In the context of broad principles, issues including risks of treatment, principles of prioritizing resources, treatment of elderly patients, and psychosocial impact are discussed.
32401686,Detailed treatment advice and options are given at a tumor stream level.
32401686,We must maintain care for patients with cancer as best we can and recognize that COVID-19 poses a significant competing risk for death that changes conventional treatment paradigms.
32401715,Effective antiviral therapy is important for tackling the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
32401715,We assessed the efficacy and safety of combined interferon beta-1b, lopinavir-ritonavir, and ribavirin for treating patients with COVID-19.
32401715,This was a multicentre, prospective, open-label, randomised, phase 2 trial in adults with COVID-19 who were admitted to six hospitals in Hong Kong.
32401715,Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to a 14-day combination of lopinavir 400 mg and ritonavir 100 mg every 12 h, ribavirin 400 mg every 12 h, and three doses of 8 million international units of interferon beta-1b on alternate days (combination group) or to 14 days of lopinavir 400 mg and ritonavir 100 mg every 12 h (control group).
32401715,The primary endpoint was the time to providing a nasopharyngeal swab negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RT-PCR, and was done in the intention-to-treat population.
32401715,The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04276688.
32401715,Between Feb 10 and March 20, 2020, 127 patients were recruited; 86 were randomly assigned to the combination group and 41 were assigned to the control group.
32401715,The median number of days from symptom onset to start of study treatment was 5 days (IQR 3-7).
32401715,The combination group had a significantly shorter median time from start of study treatment to negative nasopharyngeal swab (7 days [IQR 5-11]) than the control group (12 days [8-15]; hazard ratio 4·37 [95% CI 1·86-10·24], p=0·0010).
32401715,Adverse events included self-limited nausea and diarrhoea with no difference between the two groups.
32401715,One patient in the control group discontinued lopinavir-ritonavir because of biochemical hepatitis.
32401715,No patients died during the study.
32401715,Early triple antiviral therapy was safe and superior to lopinavir-ritonavir alone in alleviating symptoms and shortening the duration of viral shedding and hospital stay in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19.
32401715,Future clinical study of a double antiviral therapy with interferon beta-1b as a backbone is warranted.

32401931,The expansion of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) throughout the world has alarmed all health professionals.
32401931,Especially in dentistry, there is a growing concern due to it's high virulence and routes of transmission through saliva aerosols.
32401931,The virus keeps viable on air for at least 3 hours and on plastic and stainless-steel surfaces up to 72 hours.
32401931,In this sense, dental offices, both in the public and private sectors, are high-risk settings of cross infection among patients, dentists and health professionals in the clinical environment (including hospital's intensive dental care facilities).
32401931,This manuscript aims to compile current available evidence on prevention strategies for dental professionals.
32401931,Besides, we briefly describe promising treatment strategies recognized until this moment.
32401931,The purpose is to clarify dental practitioners about the virus history and microbiology, besides guiding on how to proceed during emergency consultations based on international documents.
32401931,Dentists should consider that a substantial number of individuals (including children) who do not show any signs and symptoms of COVID-19 may be infected and can disseminate the virus.
32401931,Currently, there is no effective treatment and fast diagnosis is still a challenge.
32401931,All elective dental treatments and non-essential procedures should be postponed, keeping only urgent and emergency visits to the dental office.
32401931,The use of teledentistry (phone calls, text messages) is a very promising tool to keep contact with the patient without being at risk of infection.
32402056,Recipients of heart transplant (HT) may be at increased risk of adverse outcomes attributable to infection with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) because of multiple comorbidities and clinically significant immunosuppression.
32402056,To describe the characteristics, treatment, and outcomes of recipients of HT with COVID-19.
32402056,This case series from a single large academic heart transplant program in New York, New York, incorporates data from between March 1, 2020, and April 24, 2020.
32402056,All recipients of HT followed up by this center who were infected with COVID-19 were included.
32402056,Heart transplant and a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19.
32402056,The primary measure was vital status at end of study follow-up.
32402056,Secondary measures included patient characteristics, laboratory analyses, changes to immunosuppression, and treatment administered for COVID-19.
32402056,Twenty-eight patients with HT received a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19.
32402056,The median age was 64.0 (interquartile range [IQR], 53.5-70.5) years, 22 (79%) were men, and the median time from HT was 8.6 (IQR, 4.2-14.5) years.
32402056,Comorbid conditions included hypertension in 20 patients (71%), diabetes in 17 patients (61%), and cardiac allograft vasculopathy in 16 patients (57%).
32402056,Twenty-two participants (79%) were admitted for treatment, and 7 (25%) required mechanical ventilation.
32402056,Most (13 of 17 [76%]) had evidence of myocardial injury (median high-sensitivity troponin T, 0.055 [IQR, 0.0205-0.1345] ng/mL) and elevated inflammatory biomarkers (median peak high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, 11.83 [IQR, 7.44-19.26] mg/dL; median peak interleukin 6, 105 [IQR, 38-296] pg/mL).
32402056,Among patients managed at the study institution, mycophenolate mofetil was discontinued in 16 patients (70%), and 6 (26%) had a reduction in the dose of their calcineurin inhibitor.
32402056,Treatment of COVID-19 included hydroxychloroquine (18 patients [78%]), high-dose corticosteroids (8 patients [47%]), and interleukin 6 receptor antagonists (6 patients [26%]).
32402056,Overall, 7 patients (25%) died.
32402056,Among 22 patients (79%) who were admitted, 11 (50%) were discharged home, 4 (18%) remain hospitalized at the end of the study, and 7 (32%) died during hospitalization.
32402056,In this single-center case series, COVID-19 infection was associated with a case fatality rate of 25% in recipients of HT.
32402056,Immunosuppression was reduced in most of this group of patients.
32402056,Further study is required to evaluate the optimal approach to management of COVID-19 infection in the HT population.
32402088,The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected care home residents internationally, with 19-72% of COVID-19 deaths occurring in care homes.
32402088,COVID-19 presents atypically in care home residents and up to 56% of residents may test positive whilst pre-symptomatic.
32402088,In this article, we provide a commentary on challenges and dilemmas identified in the response to COVID-19 for care homes and their residents.
32402088,We highlight the low sensitivity of PCR testing and the difficulties this poses for blanket screening and isolation of residents.
32402088,We discuss quarantine of residents and the potential harms associated with this.
32402088,Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) supply for care homes during the pandemic has been suboptimal and we suggest that better integration of procurement and supply is required.
32402088,Advance care planning has been challenged by the pandemic and there is a need to for healthcare staff to provide support to care homes with this.
32402088,Finally, we discuss measures to implement augmented care in care homes, including treatment with oxygen and subcutaneous fluids, and the frameworks which will be required if these are to be sustainable.
32402088,All of these challenges must be met by healthcare, social care and government agencies if care home residents and staff are to be physically and psychologically supported during this time of crisis for care homes.
32402090,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative pathogen of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), became a global threat to human health.
32402090,Liver impairment has been frequently reported as a common manifestation, although its clinical significance is still unclear, particularly in patients with underlying chronic liver disease (CLD).
32402090,To summarize the changes in liver function tests during SARS-CoV-2 infection and the impact of COVID-19 in patients with underlying CLD.
32402090,A literature review using online database Pubmed was done using the search terms &quot;SARS-CoV-2&quot;, &quot;COVID-19&quot;, &quot;liver&quot;, &quot;cirrhosis&quot; and &quot;liver transplantation&quot;.
32402090,COVID-19 is frequently associated with different degrees of abnormal liver function tests, most notably transaminases, which are usually transitory and of mild degree.
32402090,Available evidence suggests that liver injury may result from direct pathogenic effect by the virus, systemic inflammation or toxicity from commonly used drugs in this subset of patients.
32402090,SARS-CoV-2 infection in children is associated with minimal or no increase in liver enzymes, thus the presence of abnormal liver function tests should trigger evaluation for underlying liver diseases.
32402090,Although it seems that patients with CLD are not at greater risk for acquiring the infection, those with cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, autoimmune liver diseases or liver transplant may have a greater risk for severe COVID-19.
32402090,Abnormal liver function tests during the course of COVID-19 are common, though clinically significant liver injury is rare.
32402090,Further research is needed focusing on the effect of existing liver-related comorbidities on treatment and outcome of COVID-19.
32402130,The global pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Co-V-2) has resulted in a critical need to rapidly develop new pharmacologic interventions and disseminate information.
32402130,This has led to confusing and conflicting information on drug efficacy.
32402130,Remdesivir has emerged as a promising treatment for SARS-Co-V-2 infection yet published clinical pharmacology and drug interaction studies are limited.
32402130,Additional studies of the disposition of remdesivir, its active metabolite (GS-441524), and its triphosphate metabolite (GS-443902) are needed.
32402532,In view of the exceptional public health situation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, a consensus work has been promoted from the ethics group of the Spanish Society of Intensive, Critical Medicine and Coronary Units (SEMICYUC), with the objective of finding some answers from ethics to the crossroads between the increase of people with intensive care needs and the effective availability of means.
32402532,In a very short period, the medical practice framework has been changed to a 'catastrophe medicine' scenario, with the consequent change in the decision-making parameters.
32402532,In this context, the allocation of resources or the prioritization of treatment become crucial elements, and it is important to have an ethical reference framework to be able to make the necessary clinical decisions.
32402532,For this, a process of narrative review of the evidence has been carried out, followed by a unsystematic consensus of experts, which has resulted in both the publication of a position paper and recommendations from SEMICYUC itself, and the consensus between 18 scientific societies and 5 institutes/chairs of bioethics and palliative care of a framework document of reference for general ethical recommendations in this context of crisis.
32402766,Covid-19 is a new coronavirus disease first described in December 2019.
32402766,This respiratory illness is severe and potentially fatal.
32402766,Severe cases make up to 15%, lethality ranges between 1.5 and more than 10%.
32402766,What is urgently needed is an efficient pharmacological treatment for the treatment of severe cases.
32402766,During the infection of alveolar epithelial cells of the lung, the ACE2 receptor has a central function.
32402766,The antimalarial drugs chloroquine phosphate (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) impair in vitro the terminal glycosylation of ACE2 without significant change of cell-surface ACE2 and, therefore, might be potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 infections.
32402766,Starting inhibition at 0.1 µM, CQ completely prevented in vitro infections at 10 µM, suggesting a prophylactic effect and preventing the virus spread 5 h after infection.
32402766,In a first clinical trial, CQ was effective in inhibiting exacerbation of pneumonia, improving lung imaging findings, promotion of virus-negative conversion, and shortening the disease.
32402766,In addition, HCQ, which is three times more potent than CQ in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells (EC50 0.72 µM), was significantly associated with viral load reduction/disappearance in COVID-19 patients compared to controls.
32402766,Theoretically, CQ and HCQ could thus be effectively used in the treatment of SARS-CoV pneumonia.
32402766,From a pharmacological standpoint, however, the major problems of oral treatment with these drugs are possible severe side effects and toxicity.
32402766,Concretely, this relates to (a) the inconsistent individual bioavailability of these drugs at the alveolar target cells, depending on intestinal resorption, hepatic first-pass metabolism and accumulation in liver, spleen and lung, and (b) the need for a relatively high concentration of 1-5 µM at the alveolar surface.
32402766,Therefore, we propose in a first dose estimation the use of HCQ as an aerosol in a dosage of 2-4 mg per inhalation in order to reach sufficient therapeutic levels at the alveolar epithelial cells.
32402766,By using a low-dose non-systemic aerosol, adverse drug reactions will markedly be reduced compared with oral application.
32402766,This increase in tolerability enables a broader use for prevention and after contact with an infected person, which would be an advantage especially for the high-risk, often multi-morbid and elderly patients.
32402766,Empirical data on self-medication with a one-week aerosol application by two of the authors is presented.
32402766,Inhalation was well tolerated without relevant side effects.
32402856,The ongoing SARS-CoV2 outbreak has developed into a global pandemic.
32402856,Despite previous outbreaks of SARS-CoV and the related MERS-CoV in recent years, neither a vaccine nor any other medication for an effective treatment are currently available.
32402856,Endo-lysosomal two-pore cation channels have now emerged as potential novel targets for SARS-CoV treatment.
32403153,A 46-year old construction worker presented at the emergency department with two orthostatic syncopes.
32403153,The patient complained of prolonged fever and coughs for 7 days which had not improved after oral treatment with sultamicillin for 5 days, prescribed by the patient's general practitioner.
32403153,Physical examination showed high blood pressure due to previously known hypertension.
32403153,Other vital signs without pathological findings.
32403153,Pulmonary auscultation showed basal soft crackling noises of the left lung FINDINGS AND DIAGNOSIS: Laboratory examination showed increased values for LDH, pro-BNP and CRP and normal values for leucocytes and procalcitonin.
32403153,Conventional X-Ray of the chest showed bipulmonal lateral atypical infiltrates.
32403153,After the first PCR turned in negative another PCR-analysis for SARS-CoV-2 of a deep oral swab-sample was performed since the clinical, laboratory and radiological findings were typical for COVID-19.
32403153,Again, SARS-CoV-2-RNA was not detected.
32403153,A CT-scan of the chest showed bipulmonal lateral ground-glass attenuation, again typical for COVID-19 associated pneumonia.
32403153,After a third attempt for a PCR-analysis of a deep oral swab-sample was negative, analysis of a sputum was performed which finally confirmed the diagnosis of COVID-19 associated pneumonia.
32403153,The patient was admitted for evaluation of syncopes and suspect of COVID-19 associated pneumonia.
32403153,The patient was prophylactically isolated while the result of SARS-CoV-2-PCR from a deep oral swab was pending.
32403153,Suspecting a possible secondary bacterial infection at the beginning, intravenous antibiotic treatment with ampicillin/sulbactam was initiated.
32403153,While further examinations showed no indication for bacterial infection, antibiotics were discontinued after 3 days.
32403153,Due to clinical recovery antiviral therapy was not performed after confirming the diagnosis.
32403153,The patient was discharged 17 days after onset of first symptoms without any requirements for further isolation.
32403153,This casuistic describes a case of COVID-19 associated pneumonia presenting with typical clinical features, laboratory and radiological findings.
32403153,Detection of viral RNA was not successful from deep oral swab-samples despite repeated attempts.
32403153,Finally, PCR-analysis of sputum confirmed the diagnosis.
32403153,Analysis of deeper airway samples (sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage, tracheal secretions) or stool for SARS-CoV-2 should be performed in cases of evident clinical suspicion of COVID-19 and negative PCR results from deep oral swabs.
32403153,Ein 46-jähriger Bauarbeiter stellte sich bei seit ca.
32403153,7 Tagen bestehender Infektsymptomatik mit Fieber und teilweise produktivem Husten sowie 2-maliger orthotstatischer Synkope in der Notaufnahme vor.
32403153,Ambulant war bereits eine orale antibiotische Therapie über 5 Tage mit Sultamicillin durch den Hausarzt eingeleitet worden, die zu keiner Beschwerdebesserung führte.
32403153,In der klinischen Untersuchung zeigten sich hypertone Blutdruckwerte bei bekannter arterieller Hypertonie, ansonsten unauffällige Vitalparameter sowie pulmonal feinblasige Rasselgeräusche links basal.
32403153,Laborchemisch präsentierten sich erhöhte Werte für LDH sowie pro-BNP und CRP bei normwertigen Leukozyten und normwertigem Procalcitonin.
32403153,Bei Verdacht auf Pneumonie wurde zunächst ein konventionelles Röntgenbild der Lunge durchgeführt, das laterale Verschattungen in beiden Lungen zeigte, verdächtig auf eine atypische Pneumonie.
32403153,Bei initial negativem Rachenabstrich trotz typischer klinischer, radiologischer und laborchemischer Konstellation erfolgte ein erneuter tiefer Rachenabstrich auf SARS-CoV-2, welcher ebenfalls negativ ausfiel.
32403153,In der nachgeschalteten CT-Untersuchung des Thorax zeigten sich für COVID-19 typische bipulmonale laterale milchglasartige Infiltrate, woraufhin ein dritter Rachenabstrich durchgeführt wurde, der erneut negativ blieb.
32403153,Nach Asservierung und PCR-Analyse von Sputum konnte schließlich der Nachweis von SARS-CoV-2 erbracht und die Diagnose einer COVID-19-assoziierten Pneumonie gesichert werden.
32403153,Es erfolgte die stationäre Aufnahme zur Infekt- und Synkopen-Abklärung.
32403153,Bei zunächst noch ausstehendem Ergebnis des Rachenabstrichs auf SARS-CoV-2 wurde der Patient prophylaktisch isoliert.
32403153,Bei Verdacht auf eine mögliche bakteriell-superinfizierte Pneumonie wurde eine intravenöse antibiotische Therapie mit Ampicillin/Sulbactam eingeleitet, welche nach 3 Tagen bei fehlenden Hinweisen auf bakterielle Erreger beendet wurde.
32403153,Nach Diagnosesicherung erfolgte bei bereits eingetretener klinischer Rekonvaleszenz keine antivirale Therapie.
32403153,Der Patient wurde 17 Tage nach initialem Symptombeginn ohne weitere Quarantäne-Auflagen nach Hause entlassen.
32403153,Die Kasuistik beschreibt einen Fall von COVID-19, bei dem trotz typischer klinischer Symptomatik sowie typischen radiologischen und laborchemischen Befunden ein Virusnachweis in mehrfach korrekt durchgeführten tiefen Rachenabstrichen nicht möglich war.
32403153,Erst eine Sputum-Analyse erbrachte den Nachweis der viralen RNA und sicherte die Diagnose.
32403153,Bei begründetem klinischem Verdacht auf COVID-19 sollte daher bei negativen Rachenabstrichen zum sicheren Ausschluss eine Analyse von tiefen Atemwegssekreten (Sputum, bronchoalveoläre Lavage, Trachealsekret) oder Stuhl erfolgen.
32403202,The COVID-19 pandemic has forced the entire world to stop.
32403202,Silence occupies side streets while emptiness cleanses our oceans and skies.
32403202,For those who have the privilege of staying home, the world feels frozen.
32403202,Everything and everyone are paused, with the exception of healthcare and other essential workers.
32403202,On the front lines, physicians, nurses, respiratory therapists and other healthcare workers are overwhelmed.
32403202,Emergency rooms are inundated, and intensive care units are besieged with COVID-19 patients.
32403242,In early December 2019, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) first emerged in Wuhan, China.
32403242,As of May 10th, 2020, a total of over 4 million COVID-19 cases and 280,000 deaths have been reported globally, reflecting the raised infectivity and severity of this virus.
32403242,Amongst hospitalised COVID-19 patients, there is a high prevalence of established cardiovascular disease (CVD).
32403242,There is evidence showing that COVID-19 may exacerbate cardiovascular risk factors and preexisting CVD or may lead to cardiovascular complications.
32403242,With intensive care units operating at maximum capacity and such staggering mortality rates reported, it is imperative during this time-sensitive COVID-19 outbreak to identify patients with an increased risk of adverse outcomes and/or myocardial injury.
32403242,Preliminary findings from COVID-19 studies have shown the association of biomarkers of acute cardiac injury and coagulation with worse prognosis.
32403242,While these biomarkers are recognised for CVD, there is emerging prospect that they may aid prognosis in COVID-19, especially in patients with cardiovascular comorbidities or risk factors that predispose to worse outcomes.
32403242,Consequently, the aim of this review is to identify cardiovascular prognostic factors associated with morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 and to highlight considerations for incorporating laboratory testing of biomarkers of cardiovascular performance in COVID-19 to optimise outcomes.
32403255,The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) infection has been predominantly linked to respiratory distress syndrome, but gastrointestinal symptoms and hepatic injury have also been reported.
32403255,The mechanism of liver injury is poorly understood and may result as a consequence of viral hepatitis, systemic inflammatory response, gut barrier and microbiome alterations, intensive care treatment or drug toxicity.
32403255,The incidence of hepatopathy among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is unclear, but studies have reported liver injury in patients with SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).
32403255,We aimed to systematically review data on the prevalence of hepatic impairments and their clinical course in SARS and MERS <i>Coronaviridae</i> infections.
32403255,A systematic literature search (PubMed/Embase/Cinahl/Web of Science) according to preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis protocols (PRISMA) was conducted from database inception until 17/03/2020 for studies that evaluated the incidence of hepatic abnormalities in SARS CoV-1, SARS CoV-2 and MERS infected patients with reported liver-related parameters.
32403255,A total of forty-three studies were included.
32403255,Liver anomalies were predominantly mild to moderately elevated transaminases, hypoalbuminemia and prolongation of prothrombin time.
32403255,Histopathology varied between non-specific inflammation, mild steatosis, congestion and massive necrosis.
32403255,More studies to elucidate the mechanism and importance of liver injury on the clinical course and prognosis in patients with novel SARS-CoV-2 infection are warranted.
32403895,During this unprecedented time of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) pandemic, most countries are struggling to optimize their healthcare resources.
32403895,Although the prevention and treatment of COVID 19 has become the priority for the majority of the population, most medical professionals are facing the challenge of balancing the management of this pandemic and treating patients with other diseases.
32403895,Healthcare professionals from all specialties are facing this situation and designing guidelines and recommendations that are contributing to the literature that is crucial for disease management at the current time.
32403895,We share our experience with two ends of the spectra that we currently observe in spine patients.
32403895,One group of patients included the non-operative cases that presented with back pain.
32403895,Further, we discuss our experience with operative precautions and digitally assisted discharge.
32403911,The infection with the novel SARS Cov-2 corona virus, the cause of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, possessing its origin in the Chinese province Hubei, has reached the extent of a global pandemic within a few months.
32403911,After aerosol infection, most people experience mild respiratory infection with cold symptoms such as cough and fever, and healing within two weeks.
32403911,In about 5% of those infected, however, a severe course develops with the occurrence of multiple sub pleural bronchopulmonary infiltrates and even death as a result of respiratory failure.
32403911,The corona virus pandemic has multiple impacts on social life that have not been seen before.
32403911,For example, the government adopted measures to curb the exponential spread of the virus, which included a significant reduction in social contacts.
32403911,Furthermore, the specialist societies recommended that no elective treatments be carried out during the pandemic period.
32403911,This review article considers epidemiological aspects of novel corona virus infection and presents both the clinical as well the possible economic effects of the pandemic on gynaecology, obstetrics and reproductive medicine in Germany in the past, present and future.
32403911,In addition, useful preventive measures for daily clinical work and the previously known scientific findings dealing with the impact of corona virus on pregnancy and birth are discussed.
32403946,<b>Background:</b> We describe cancer patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) infection treated at the Piacenza's general hospital (north Italy). <b>Materials &amp; methods:</b> Twenty-five cancer patients infected by COVID-19 admitted at the Piacenza's general hospital from 21 February to 18 March 2020.
32403946,Outcome from the infection were compared with infected noncancer patients. <b>Results:</b> Twenty patients (80%) were treated with antiviral therapy and hydroxychloroquine and five (20%) received hydroxychloroquine alone.
32403946,Nine (36%) patients died, while 16 (64%) overcome the infection.
32403946,In the control group the mortality was 16.13% and the overcome from infection was 83.87%. <b>Conclusion:</b> Mortality for COVID-19 was greater in cancer patients when compared with noncancer patients, worse prognosis for older age, women and patients treated with hydroxychloroquine alone.
32403946,However, the comparisons did not reach statistical significance in most cases.
32403946,This could be due to the small sample size that is the main limitation of the study.
32403995,Coronaviruses cause severe human viral diseases including SARS, MERS and COVID-19.
32403995,Most recently SARS-CoV-2 virus (causing COVID-19) has led to a pandemic with no successful therapeutics.
32403995,The SARS-CoV-2 infection relies on trimeric spike (S) proteins to facilitate virus entry into host cells by binding to ACE2 receptor on host cell membranes.
32403995,Therefore, blocking this interaction with antibodies are promising agents against SARS-CoV-2.
32403995,Here we describe using humanized llama antibody VHHs against SARS-CoV-2 that would overcome the limitations associated with polyclonal and monoclonal combination therapies.
32403995,From two llama VHH libraries, unique humanized VHHs that bind to S protein and block the S/ACE2 interaction were identified.
32403995,Furthermore, pairwise combination of VHHs showed synergistic blocking.
32403995,Multi-specific antibodies with enhanced affinity and avidity, and improved S/ACE2 blocking are currently being developed using an <i>in-silico</i> approach that also fuses VHHs to Fc domains.
32403995,Importantly, our current bi-specific antibody shows potent S/ACE2 blocking (KD - 0.25 nM, IC100 ∼ 36.7 nM, IC95 ∼ 12.2 nM, IC50 ∼ 1 nM) which is significantly better than individual monoclonal VHH-Fcs.
32403995,Overall, this design would equip the VHH-Fcs multiple mechanisms of actions against SARS-CoV-2.
32403995,Thus, we aim to contribute to the battle against COVID-19 by developing therapeutic antibodies as well as diagnostics.
32404126,This study aims to assess the effectiveness of delivering Solution Focused Brief Therapy (SFBT) through telecommunication with a group of adolescents who present anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 outbreak.
32404126,We hypothesize that participants who are randomly assigned to receive 2-4 sessions of Solution Focused Brief Therapy would have better clinical outcomes than participants who are in the waitlist group.
32404126,We additionally hypothesized that using SFBT can also change participants' depression levels and their coping strategies in dealing with distress during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32404126,This study employs a randomized delayed crossover open label controlled trial in adolescents who are presenting anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 outbreak.
32404126,Participants who meet the enrollment criteria stated below will be invited to participate in this study through telecommunication.
32404126,Those accepting will be randomly allocated to the intervention group or waitlist group.
32404170,The prolonged lockdown of health services providing high-complexity fertility treatments -as currently recommended by many reproductive medicine entities- is detrimental for society as a whole, and infertility patients in particular.
32404170,Globally, approximately 0.3% of all infants born every year are conceived using assisted reproductive technology (ART) treatments.
32404170,By contrast, the total number of COVID-19 deaths reported so far represents approximately 1.0% of the total deaths expected to occur worldwide over the first three months of the current year.
32404170,It seems, therefore, that the number of infants expected to be conceived and born -but who will not be so due to the lockdown of infertility services- might be as significant as the total number of deaths attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic.
32404170,We herein propose remedies that include a prognostic-stratification of more vulnerable infertility cases in order to plan a progressive restart of worldwide fertility treatments.
32404170,At a time when preventing complications and limiting burdens for national health systems represent relevant issues, our viewpoint might help competent authorities and health care providers to identify patients who should be prioritized for the continuation of fertility care in a safe environment.
32404189,The rapid spread of the corona virus pandemic is an existential problem for many people in numerous countries.
32404189,So far, there is no effective vaccine protection or proven therapy available against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
32404189,In this review, we describe the role of passive immunization in times of the corona virus.
32404189,Passive immunization could be a bridging technology to improve the immune defense of critically ill patients until better approaches with effective medications are available.
32404205,The 2019 coronavirus pandemic is a current global health crisis.
32404205,Many chiropractic institutions, associations, and researchers have stepped up at a time of need.
32404205,However, a subset of the chiropractic profession has claimed that spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) is clinically effective in improving one's immunity, despite the lack of supporting scientific evidence.
32404205,These unsubstantiated claims contradict official public health policy reflecting poorly on the profession.
32404205,The aim of this commentary is to provide our perspective on the claims regarding SMT and clinically relevant immunity enhancement, drawing attention to the damaging ramifications these claims might have on our profession's reputation.
32404205,The World Federation of Chiropractic released a rapid review demonstrating the lack of clinically relevant evidence regarding SMT and immunity enhancement.
32404205,The current claims contradicting this review carry significant potential risk to patients.
32404205,Furthermore, as a result of these misleading claims, significant media attention and public critiques of the profession are being made.
32404205,We believe inaction by regulatory bodies will lead to confusion among the public and other healthcare providers, unfortunately damaging the profession's reputation.
32404205,The resulting effect on the reputation of the profession is greatly concerning to us, as students.
32404205,It is our hope that all regulatory bodies will protect the public by taking appropriate action against chiropractors making unfounded claims contradicting public health policy.
32404205,We believe it is the responsibility of all stakeholders in the chiropractic profession to ensure this is carried out and the standard of care is raised.
32404205,We call on current chiropractors to ensure a viable profession exists moving forward.
32404219,As in other European countries, the current Covid-19 pandemic has not only massively restricted normal life in Germany, it is also having a significant effect on medical treatment, particularly in the areas of child and adolescent psychiatric care, as well as on university teaching.
32404219,The federal structure of Germany and epidemiological differences between individual federal states has had a crucial impact on the regulations issued and their success.
32404219,During the last number of weeks, tele-child-psychiatry and psychotherapy have increased, and outpatient services have been used cautiously and sparingly.
32404219,Medical staff numbers will be augmented by doctors and nurses returning from retirement and also by medical students on a voluntary basis.
32404219,The federal government has warned that discrepancies in education will increase due to the closure of schools.
32404219,Questions of child protection are currently of particular importance in the context of such closures and the non-availability of day-care centres.
32404232,The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic affect all groups in society.
32404232,People with intellectual disability are especially vulnerable to the physical, mental and social effects of the pandemic.
32404232,Cognitive impairments can limit understanding of information to protect them relying on carers to be vigilant on their behalf during quarantine.
32404232,Restrictions on usual activities are likely to induce mental stress especially among those who are autistic leading to an escalation in challenging behaviours, risk of placement breakdown, and increased the use of psychotropic medication.
32404232,People with intellectual disability are vulnerable to exploitation by others where the usual community supports no longer function to protect them.
32404232,In future pandemics, it is important that lessons are learned from the impacts COVID-19 has on people with intellectual disability.
32404232,Collecting the evidence through a rigorous approach should help to empower people with intellectual disability and their carers to face future outbreaks of infectious diseases.
32404302,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses an unprecedented challenge to healthcare worldwide.
32404302,The infection can be life threatening and require intensive care treatment.
32404302,The transmission of the disease poses a risk to both patients and healthcare workers.
32404302,The number of patients requiring hospital admission and intensive care may overwhelm health systems and negatively affect standard care for patients presenting with conditions needing emergency interventions.
32404302,This position statements aims to assist cardiologists in the invasive management of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.
32404302,To that end, we assembled a panel of interventional cardiologists and acute cardiac care specialists appointed by the European Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions (EAPCI) and from the Acute Cardiovascular Care Association (ACVC) and included the experience from the first and worst affected areas in Europe.
32404302,Modified diagnostic and treatment algorithms are proposed to adapt evidence-based protocols for this unprecedented challenge.
32404302,Various clinical scenarios, as well as management algorithms for patients with a diagnosed or suspected COVID-19 infection, presenting with ST- and non-ST-segment elevation ACS are described.
32404302,In addition, we address the need for re-organization of ACS networks, with redistribution of hub and spoke hospitals, as well as for in-hospital reorganization of emergency rooms and cardiac units, with examples coming from multiple European countries.
32404302,Furthermore, we provide a guidance to reorganization of catheterization laboratories and, importantly, measures for protection of healthcare providers involved with invasive procedures.
32404451,<b>Question</b> Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is affecting millions of people worldwide.
32404451,It seems that it affects mostly adults older than 40 years of age, and the death rate is highest for older individuals in the population.
32404451,What should I tell parents worried about their children contracting the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causing COVID-19, and what symptoms should I look for to determine if there is a need to test for the virus?
32404451,<b>Answer</b> The COVID-19 global pandemic affects all ages.
32404451,Severe respiratory manifestations have been the mainstay of illness in adults, with what seems to be rapid deterioration necessitating mechanical ventilation.
32404451,Only 5% of those tested and found to have COVID-19 have been younger than 19 years, possibly owing to limited testing, as the symptoms in children are usually mild.
32404451,Symptoms in children include fever, dry cough, rhinorrhea, sore throat, and fatigue, and in 10% diarrhea or vomiting.
32404451,Rarely dyspnea or hypoxemia were also described.
32404451,Blood tests and imaging have been shown to be of little value in children and should only be ordered for those in whom you would normally order these investigations for viral-like illness.
32404451,No specific therapy is available and supportive care with rest, fluids, and antipyretics for children is the recommended approach.
32404451,Ibuprofen or acetaminophen for fever and pain can be given.
32404451,Antiviral and immunomodulatory treatment is not recommended at this time for otherwise healthy children, and corticosteroids should also not be used.
32404451,Children with immunocompromised states should be isolated and avoid contact with others.
32404473,Countries globally are affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with nearly two million cases and 120 000 deaths occurring within 4 months of the discovery of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 in December 2019 in China.
32404473,Accurate diagnoses of cases is key in managing the pandemic by identification, isolation and treatment of patients and defining the epidemiology of the virus.
32404473,By mid-January 2020, a scientist from China published the full genome of the virus, which facilitated the development of accurate molecular diagnostic assays.
32404473,By the end of January 2020, the WHO, in collaboration with laboratories in Asia, Europe and the USA, published several real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (rtRT-PCR) protocols that allowed identification of cases and development of commercial assays.
32404473,Clinical investigations facilitated development of accurate case definition and guidance for laboratories on the optimum specimens and procedures for diagnoses.
32404473,Currently, laboratory-based rtRT-PCR is the recommended test for diagnoses of acute cases to ensure patients can be identified and isolated and to facilitate the public health response.
32404473,However, due to delays in diagnoses, severe shortage of tests and laboratory capacity, point-of-care molecular or antigen tests are becoming more attractive.
32404473,Although serological tests are not suitable for diagnoses of acute cases, they are important to define epidemiological questions, including attack rate in the population, and to identify immune individuals.
32404473,This review aimed to summarise the current available information for diagnoses of cases and to aid laboratories and healthcare workers to select the best assays and procedures.
32404477,Neutralizing antibodies could be antivirals against COVID-19 pandemics.
32404477,Here, we report isolation of four human-origin monoclonal antibodies from a convalescent patient, all of which display neutralization abilities.
32404477,B38 and H4 block the binding between virus S-protein RBD and cellular receptor ACE2.
32404477,A competition assay indicates their different epitopes on the RBD, making them a potential virus-targeting MAb-pair to avoid immune escape in future clinical applications.
32404477,Moreover, a therapeutic study in a mouse model validated that these antibodies can reduce virus titers in infected lungs.
32404477,The RBD-B38 complex structure revealed that most residues on the epitope overlap with the RBD-ACE2 binding interface, explaining the blocking effect and neutralizing capacity.
32404477,Our results highlight the promise of antibody-based therapeutics and provide a structural basis for rational vaccine design.
32404514,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and first emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.
32404514,Since then, the virus has rapidly spread to many countries.
32404514,While the outbreak in China appears to be in decline, the disease has spread across the world, with a daily increase in the number of confirmed cases and infection-related deaths.
32404514,Here, we highlight (i) the lessons that have been learnt so far and how they will benefit reducing the impact of COVID-19 disease and (ii) an update on the status of drug treatment and vaccine development to prevent COVID-19 and potential future related pandemics.
32404514,Although the mortality rate is clearly higher than for influenza, the rate does seem to vary from country to country, possibly reflecting differences in how rapidly local health authorities respond to isolate and effectively care for the affected population.
32404514,Drugs are urgently needed for both prophylaxis and the treatment of severely ill patients; however, no proven effective therapies for SARS-CoV-2 currently exist.
32404514,A number of drugs that have been approved for other diseases are being tested for the treatment of COVID-19 patients, but there is an absence of data from appropriately designed clinical trials showing that these drugs, either alone or in combination, will prove effective.
32404514,There is also a global urgency to develop a vaccine against COVID-19, but development and appropriate testing will take at least a year before such a vaccine will be globally available.
32404514,This review summarizes the lessons learnt so far from the COVID-19 pandemic, examines the evidence regarding the drugs that are being tested for the treatment of COVID19, and describes the progress made in efforts to develop an effective vaccine.
32404651,: The COVID19 crisis has created many additional challenges for patients with opioid use disorder, including those seeking treatment with medications for OUD.
32404651,Some of these challenges include closure of substance use treatment clinics, focus of emergency departments on COVID-19 patients, social distancing and shelter in place orders affecting mental health, bystander overdose rescue, threats to income and supply of substances for people who use drugs.
32404651,While the initial changes in regulation allowing buprenorphine prescribing by telehealth are welcomed by providers and patients, many additional innovations are required to ensure that additional vulnerabilities and hurdles created by this pandemic scenario do not further fan the flames of the opioid epidemic.
32404652,: During the COVID-19 pandemic, many addiction treatment and harm reduction organizations have had to reduce their hours and services for people with substance use disorders, placing these individuals at increased risk of death.
32404652,In order to address restricted treatment access during COVID-19, guidance from the Substance Abuse Mental Health Services Administration, the US Drug Enforcement Administration, and the US Department of Health and Human Services has allowed for use of audio-only telehealth encounters for buprenorphine induction without requiring an in-person evaluation or video interface.
32404652,This has enabled innovations in order to try to meet the needs of the most vulnerable among us during the current pandemic.
32404652,In this new regulatory environment, we established the Rhode Island Buprenorphine Hotline, a phone hotline which functions as a &quot;tele-bridge&quot; clinic where people with moderate to severe opioid use disorder can be linked with a DATA 2000 waivered provider who can provide an initial assessment and, if appropriate, prescribe buprenorphine for unobserved induction and linkage to outpatient treatment.
32404652,In this correspondence we briefly share our experience developing this common sense approach to addressing the complex problem of access to treatment only now permissible due to regulatory changes during COVID-19.
32404780,We report the first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) comorbid with leukemia in a patient hospitalized in Beijing, China.
32404780,The patient showed a prolonged manifestation of symptoms and a protracted diagnosis period of COVID-19.
32404780,It is necessary to extend isolation time, increase the number of nucleic acid detections and conduct early symptomatic treatment for children with both COVID-19 and additional health problems.
32404786,To describe the characteristics of clinical manifestations of children with 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection in Chongqing.
32404786,All 25 children with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RNA-PCR) were admitted from the 4 designated treatment hospitals of 2019-nCoV in Chongqing from January 19 to March 12, 2020.
32404786,Clinical data and epidemiological history of these patients were retrospectively collected and analyzed.
32404786,The diagnosis was confirmed through RNA-PCR testing.
32404786,Among the 25 cases, 14 were males and 11 were females.
32404786,The median age was 11.0 (6.3-14.5) years (range 0.6-17.0 years).
32404786,All children were related to a family cluster outbreak, and 7 children (28%) with a travel or residence history in Hubei Province.
32404786,These patients could be categorized into different clinical types, including 8 (32%) asymptomatic, 4 (16%) very mild cases and 13 (52%) common cases.
32404786,No severe or critical cases were identified.
32404786,The most common symptoms were cough (13 cases, 52%) and fever (6 cases, 24%).
32404786,The duration time of clinical symptoms was 13.0 (8.0-25.0) days.
32404786,In the 25 cases, on admission, 21 cases (84%) had normal white blood cell counts, while only 2 cases (8%) more than 10 × 10/L and 2 cases (8%) less than 4 × 10/L, respectively; 22 cases(88%) had normal CD4+ T lymphocyte counts, while in the remaining 3 cases(8%) this increased mildly; 23 cases had normal CD8+ T lymphocyte counts, while in the remaining 2 cases (8%) CD8+ T lymphocyte counts were mildly increased as well.
32404786,All Lymphocyte counts were normal.
32404786,There were no statistical differences of lab results between the groups of asymptomatic cases, mild cases and common cases.
32404786,There were only 13 cases with abnormal CT imaging, most of which were located in the subpleural area of the bottom of the lung.
32404786,All patients were treated with interferon, 6 cases combined with Ribavirin, and 12 cases combined with lopinavir or ritonavir.
32404786,The days from onset to RNA turning negative was 15.20 ± 6.54 days.
32404786,There was no significant difference of RNA turning negative between the groups of interferon, interferon plus ribavirin and interferon plus lopinavir or ritonavir treatment.
32404786,All the cases recovered and were discharged from hospital.
32404786,The morbidity of 2019-nCoV infection in children is lower than in adults and the clinical manifestations and inflammatory biomarkers in children are nonspecific and milder than that in adults.
32404786,RNA-PCR test is still the most reliable diagnostic method, especially for asymptomatic patients.
32404975,The new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly spread over the world causing the disease by WHO called COVID-19.
32404975,This pandemic poses unprecedented stress on the health care system including programs performing allogeneic and autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) and cellular therapy such as with CAR T cells.
32404975,Risk factors for severe disease include age and predisposing conditions such as cancer.
32404975,The true impact on stem cell transplant and CAR T-cell recipients in unknown.
32404975,The European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) has therefore developed recommendations for transplant programs and physicians caring for these patients.
32404975,These guidelines were developed by experts from the Infectious Diseases Working Party and have been endorsed by EBMT's scientific council and board.
32404975,This work intends to provide guidelines for transplant centers, management of transplant candidates and recipients, and donor issues until the COVID-19 pandemic has passed.
32405058,The current COVID-19 pandemic challenges oncologists to profoundly re-organize oncological care in order to dramatically reduce hospital visits and admissions and therapy-induced immune-related complications without compromising cancer outcomes.
32405058,Since COVID-19 is a novel disease, guidance by scientific evidence is often unavailable, and impactful decisions are inevitably made on the basis of expert opinions.
32405058,Here we report how the seven comprehensive cancer centers of Cancer Core Europe have organized their healthcare systems at an unprecedented scale and pace to make their operations 'pandemic proof'.
32405058,We identify and discuss many commonalities, but also important local differences, and pinpoint critical research priorities to enable evidence-based remodeling of cancer care during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32405058,Also, we discuss how the current situation offers a unique window of opportunity for assessing the effects of de-escalating anticancer regimens, which may fast-forward the development of more-refined and less-toxic treatments.
32405058,By sharing our joint experiences, we offer a roadmap for proceeding and aim to mobilize the global research community to generate the data that are critically needed to offer the best possible care to patients.
32405071,Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) may increase due to upregulation in patients using angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB).
32405071,Because renin-angiotensin system blockers increase levels of ACE2, a protein that facilitates coronavirus entry into cells, there is concern that these drugs could increase the risk of developing a severe and fatal form of COVID-19.
32405071,The impact of discontinuing ACEI and ARBs in patients with COVID-19 remains uncertain.<b>DESIGN</b>BRACE CORONA is a pragmatic, multicenter, randomized, phase IV, clinical trial that aims to enroll around 500 participants at 32 sites in Brazil.
32405071,Participants will be identified from an ongoing national registry of suspected and confirmed cases of COVID-19.
32405071,Eligible patients using renin-angiotensin system blockers (ACEI/ARBs) with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 will be randomized to a strategy of continued ACEI/ARB treatment versus temporary discontinuation for 30 days.
32405071,The primary outcome is the median days alive and out of the hospital at 30 days.
32405071,Secondary outcomes include progression of COVID-19 disease, all-cause mortality, death from vascular causes, myocardial infarction, stroke, transient ischemic attack, new or worsening heart failure, myocarditis, pericarditis, arrhythmias, thromboembolic events, hypertensive crisis, respiratory failure, hemodynamic decompensation, sepsis, renal failure, troponin, B-type natriuretic peptide, N-terminal-pro hormone and D-dimer levels.
32405071,BRACE CORONA will evaluate whether the strategy of continued ACEI/ARB therapy compared with temporary discontinuation of these drugs impacts clinical outcomes among patients with COVID-19.
32405079,Novel coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19) has been spreading worldwide, and tracking laboratory indexes during the diagnosis and treatment of patients with severe COVID-19 can provide a reference for patients in other countries and regions.
32405079,We closely tracked the epidemiological history, diagnosis and treatment process, as well as dynamic changes in routine blood indicators, of a severe COVID-19 patient who was hospitalized for 26 days.
32405079,Our study found that the patient's condition worsened in the first week after admission, white blood cells (WBCs), neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, red blood cells (RBCs), hemoglobin, neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelets (PLT) and platelet lymphocyte ratio (PLR) decreased.
32405079,On the 7th day of admission, the levels of these cells decreased to their lowest values, though the red blood cell distribution width (RDW) and C-reactive protein (CRP) level remained at high values.
32405079,From 8 to 14 days of admission, the patient's condition improved, hypoxemia was corrected, and mechanical ventilation was discontinued.
32405079,The number of WBCs, neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils and lymphocytes increased gradually, and the erythrocyte parameters stopped declining and stabilized in a certain range; CRP decreased rapidly.
32405079,On the 20th day of admission, the nucleic acid test was negative, WBC, neutrophil, CRP, NLR and PLR decreased gradually, and monocyte, lymphocyte, and eosinophil counts increased.
32405079,Although RBCs and hemoglobin (Hb) levels continued to decrease, RDW gradually increased, indicating the recovery of hematopoiesis.
32405079,In addition, it should be noted that monocytes and eosinophils were at extremely low levels within 10 days after admission; the recovery time of eosinophils was approximately 12 days after admission, which was earlier than other parameters, which might be of great value in judging the progress of the disease.
32405079,Dynamic changes in routine blood parameters might be helpful for the prognosis of COVID-19 patients and evaluation of the treatment effect.
32405080,We observe changes of the main lymphocyte subsets (CD16<sup>+</sup>CD56、CD19、CD3、CD4、and CD8) in COVID-19-infected patients and explore whether the changes are associated with disease severity.
32405080,One-hundred and fifty-four cases of COVID-19-infected patients were selected and divided into 3 groups (moderate group, severe group and critical group).
32405080,The flow cytometry assay was performed to examine the numbers of lymphocyte subsets.
32405080,CD3<sup>+</sup>, CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8 + T lymphocyte subsets were decreased in COVID-19-infected patients.
32405080,Compared with the moderate group and the sever group, CD3<sup>+</sup>, CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the critical group decreased greatly (P &lt; 0.001, P = 0.005 or P = 0.001).
32405080,Reduced CD3<sup>+</sup>, CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocyte counts may reflect the severity of the COVID-19.
32405080,Monitoring T cell changes has important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of severe patients who may become critically ill.
32405088,The COVID 19 global pandemic has engulfed humanity with a huge impact on health systems across the world.
32405088,Many patients develop myocardial injury which can lead to significant cardiovascular complications including HF.
32405088,This will require aggressive management strategies which are evolving.
32405088,Guideline directed drug therapy including ACEI/ARB/ARNI is to be continued in patients with pre-existing HF.
32405088,Long-term cardiovascular effects of COVID-19 are yet to be ascertained.
32405088,Protection of health care personnel from contracting the disease should be given high priority.
32405101,An increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) has been reported.
32405101,Whether COVID-19 increases the risk of VTE in non-ICU wards remains unknown.
32405101,We aimed to evaluate the burden of asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in COVID-19 patients with elevated D-dimer levels.
32405101,In this prospective study consecutive patients hospitalized in non-intensive care units with diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia and D-dimer &gt; 1000 ng/ml were screened for asymptomatic DVT with complete compression doppler ultrasound (CCUS).
32405101,The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee.
32405101,The study comprised 156 patients (65.4% male).
32405101,All but three patients received standard doses of thromboprophylaxis.
32405101,Median days of hospitalization until CCUS was 9 (IQR 5-17).
32405101,CCUS was positive for DVT in 23 patients (14.7%), of whom only one was proximal DVT.
32405101,Seven patients (4.5%) had bilateral distal DVT.
32405101,Patients with DVT had higher median D-dimer levels: 4527 (IQR 1925-9144) ng/ml vs 2050 (IQR 1428-3235) ng/ml; p &lt; 0.001.
32405101,D-dimer levels &gt; 1570 ng/ml were associated with asymptomatic DVT (OR 9.1; CI 95% 1.1-70.1).
32405101,D-dimer showed an acceptable discriminative capacity (area under the ROC curve 0.72, 95% CI 0.61-0.84).
32405101,In patients admitted with COVID-19 pneumonia and elevated D-dimer levels, the incidence of asymptomatic DVT is similar to that described in other series.
32405101,Higher cut-off levels for D-dimer might be necessary for the diagnosis of DVT in COVID-19 patients.
32405115,The COVID-19 pandemic has brought major challenges to healthcare systems and public health policies globally, as it requires novel treatment and prevention strategies to adapt for the impact of the pandemic.
32405115,Individuals with substance user disorders (SUD) are at risk population for contamination due to multiple factors - attributable to their clinical, psychological and psychosocial conditions.
32405115,Moreover, social and economic changes caused by the pandemic, along with the traditional difficulties regarding treatment access and adherence - will certainly worsen during this period, therefore aggravate their condition.
32405115,In addition, this population are potential vectors of transmission.
32405115,In that sense, specific strategies for prevention and treatment must be discussed. health care professionals dealing with SUD must be aware of the risks and challenges they will meet during and after the COVID-19 outbreak.
32405115,Addiction care must be reinforced, instead of postponed, in order to avoid complications of both SUD and COVID-19 and to prevent the transmission of coronavirus.
32405117,SARS-CoV-2-caused COVID-19 cases are growing globally, calling for developing effective therapeutics to control the current pandemic.
32405117,SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV recognize angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor via the receptor-binding domain (RBD).
32405117,Here, we identified six SARS-CoV RBD-specific neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (nAbs) that cross-reacted with SARS-CoV-2 RBD, two of which, 18F3 and 7B11, neutralized SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32405117,18F3 recognized conserved epitopes on SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs, whereas 7B11 recognized epitopes on SARS-CoV RBD not fully conserved in SARS-CoV-2 RBD.
32405117,The 18F3-recognizing epitopes on RBD did not overlap with the ACE2-binding sites, whereas those recognized by 7B11 were close to the ACE2-binding sites, explaining why 7B11 could, but 18F3 could not, block SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 RBD binding to ACE2 receptor.
32405117,Our study provides an alternative approach to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection using anti-SARS-CoV nAbs.
32405152,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is contagious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
32405152,It emerged as a global pandemic early in 2020, affecting more than 2000 countries and territories.
32405152,The infection is highly contagious with disease transmission reported from asymptomatic carriers, including children.
32405152,It spreads through person-to-person contact, via aerosol and droplets.
32405152,The practice of social distancing - maintaining a distance of 1 - 2 meters or 6 feet -- between people has been widely recommended to slow or halt the spread.
32405152,This places orthodontists at high risk of acquiring and transmitting the infection.
32405152,The objective of this review is to report to orthodontists on the emergence, epidemiology, risks, and precautions during disease crisis.
32405152,This should help increase awareness, reinforce infection control and prevent cross-transmission within the orthodontic facility.
32405152,A comprehensive literature review of English and non-English articles was performed in March, 2020 using (CORD-19 2020) dataset<b>,</b> PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, and Google Scholar to search for infection control and disease transmission in orthodontics.
32405152,This review emphasizes minimizing aerosol production and reinforcing strict infection control measures.
32405152,Compliance with highest level of personal protection and restriction of treatment to emergency cases is recommended during the outbreak.
32405152,Surface disinfection, adequate ventilation, and decontamination of instruments and supplies following the guidelines is required.
32405152,Reinforcing strict infection control measures and minimizing personal contact and aerosol production are keys to prevent contamination within the orthodontic settings.
32405152,Although no cases of COVID-19 cross-transmission within a dental facility have been reported, the risk exists and the disease is still emerging.
32405152,Further studies are required.
32405156,The emergence of SARS-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to a global pandemic disease referred to as coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19).
32405156,Hydroxychloroquine (CLQ-OH)/azithromycin (ATM) combination therapy is currently being tested for the treatment of COVID-19, with promising results.
32405156,However, the molecular mechanism of action of this combination is not yet established.
32405156,Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, this study shows that the drugs act in synergy to prevent any close contact between the virus and the plasma membrane of host cells.
32405156,Unexpected molecular similarity is shown between ATM and the sugar moiety of GM1, a lipid raft ganglioside acting as a host attachment cofactor for respiratory viruses.
32405156,Due to this mimicry, ATM interacts with the ganglioside-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.
32405156,This binding site shared by ATM and GM1 displays a conserved amino acid triad Q-134/F-135/N-137 located at the tip of the spike protein.
32405156,CLQ-OH molecules are shown to saturate virus attachment sites on gangliosides in the vicinity of the primary coronavirus receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2).
32405156,Taken together, these data show that ATM is directed against the virus, whereas CLQ-OH is directed against cellular attachment cofactors.
32405156,We conclude that both drugs act as competitive inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 attachment to the host-cell membrane.
32405156,This is consistent with a synergistic antiviral mechanism at the plasma membrane level, where therapeutic intervention is likely to be most efficient.
32405156,This molecular mechanism may explain the beneficial effects of CLQ-OH/ATM combination therapy in patients with COVID-19.
32405156,Incidentally, the data also indicate that the conserved Q-134/F-135/N-137 triad could be considered as a target for vaccine strategies.
32405160,Pneumonia with respiratory failure represents the main cause of death in COVID-19, where hyper inflammation plays an important role in lung damage.
32405160,This study aims to evaluate if tocilizumab, an anti-soluble IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody, reduces patients' mortality. 85 consecutive patients admitted to the Montichiari Hospital (Italy) with COVID-19 related pneumonia and respiratory failure, not needing mechanical ventilation, were included if satisfying at least one among: respiratory rate ≥ 30 breaths/min, peripheral capillary oxygen saturation ≤ 93% or PaO2/FiO2&lt;=300 mmHg.
32405160,Patients admitted before March 13th (n=23) were prescribed the standard therapy (hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir and ritonavir) and were considered controls.
32405160,On March 13th tocilizumab was available and patients admitted thereafter (n=62) received tocilizumab once within 4 days from admission, plus the standard care.
32405160,Patients receiving tocilizumab showed significantly greater survival rate as compared to control patients (hazard ratio for death, 0.035; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.004 to 0.347; p = 0.004), adjusting for baseline clinical characteristics.
32405160,Two out of 62 patients of the tocilizumab group and 11 out of 23 in the control group died. 92% and 42.1% of the discharged patients in the tocilizumab and control group respectively, recovered.
32405160,The respiratory function resulted improved in 64.8% of the observations in tocilizumab patients who were still hospitalized, whereas 100% of controls worsened and needed mechanical ventilation.
32405160,No infections were reported.
32405160,Tocilizumab results to have a positive impact if used early during Covid-19 pneumonia with severe respiratory syndrome in terms of increased survival and favorable clinical course.
32405164,The first report of the unusual manifestation of pneumonia-like symptoms in Wuhan City, China was made on 31 December 2019.
32405164,Within one week, the Chinese authorities reported that they had identified the causative agent as a new member of the Coronavirus family, the same family of that was responsible for MERS and SARS not so many years ago.
32405164,The new virus was called Novel Coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV).
32405164,Three weeks later, the World Health Organization declared that 2019-nCoV was capable of direct human-to-human transmission, the virus had spread across several countries in three continents, and had infected close to two thousand people, of whom at least 1 in 5 quite severely.
32405164,The number of fatalities was fast rising.
32405164,Yet, the World Health Organization officially announced that there is still at present no recommended anti-nCoV vaccine for subject at-risk, nor treatment for patients with suspected or confirmed nCoV, let alone 2019-nCov.
32405164,It is therefore timely and critical to propose new possible and practical approaches for preventive interventions for subjects at-risk, and for treatment of patients afflicted with 2019-nCov-induced disease (Corona Virus Disease 2019; COVID-19) before the present situation explodes into a worldwide pandemic.
32405164,One such potential clinical protocol is proposed as a hypothesis.
32405226,Artemisinins are sesquiterpene lactones with a peroxide moiety that are isolated from the herb Artemisia annua.
32405226,It has been used for centuries for the treatment of fever and chills, and has been recently approved for the treatment of malaria due to its endoperoxidase properties.
32405226,Progressively, research has found that artemisinins displayed multiple pharmacological actions against inflammation, viral infections, and cell and tumour proliferation, making it effective against diseases.
32405226,Moreover, it has displayed a relatively safe toxicity profile.
32405226,The use of artemisinins against different respiratory diseases has been investigated in lung cancer models and inflammatory-driven respiratory disorders.
32405226,These studies revealed the ability of artemisinins in attenuating proliferation, inflammation, invasion, and metastasis, and in inducing apoptosis.
32405226,Artemisinins can regulate the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), promote cell cycle arrest, drive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and induce Bak or Bax-dependent or independent apoptosis.
32405226,In this review, we aim to provide a comprehensive update of the current knowledge of the effects of artemisinins in relation to respiratory diseases to identify gaps that need to be filled in the course of repurposing artemisinins for the treatment of respiratory diseases.
32405226,In addition, we postulate whether artemisinins can also be repurposed for the treatment of COVID-19 given its anti-viral and anti-inflammatory properties.
32405229,The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread all around the world in a very short period of time.
32405229,Recent data are showing significant prevalence of arterial hypertension and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) among patients with COVID-19, which raised many questions about higher susceptibility of patients with these comorbidities to the novel coronavirus, as well as the role of hypertension and CVD in progression and the prognosis of COVID-19 patients.
32405229,There is a very limited amount of data, usually obtained from a small population, regarding the effect of the underlying disease on the outcome in patients with COVID-19.
32405229,The evaluation of the treatment of these comorbidities at baseline and during COVID-19 is scarce and the results are conflicting.
32405229,Hypertension and CVD, after the adjustment for other clinical and demographic parameters, primarily age, did not remain independent predictors of the lethal outcome in COVID-19 patients.
32405229,Some investigations speculated about the association between the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and susceptibility to COVID-19, as well as the relationship between RAAS inhibitors and the adverse outcome in these patients.
32405229,Withdrawing or switching RAAS inhibitors would have uncertain benefits, but it would definitely have many disadvantages such as uncontrolled hypertension, cardiac function deterioration and renal function impairment, which could potentially induce more complications in patients with COVID-19 than the infection of coronavirus itself.
32405229,The aim of this review article was to summarize the prevalence of hypertension and CVD in patients with COVID-19, their influence on the outcome and the effect of treatment of hypertension and CVD in COVID-19 patients.
32405236,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to sweep the world, causing infection of millions and death of hundreds of thousands.
32405236,The respiratory disease that it caused, COVID-19 (stands for coronavirus disease in 2019), has similar clinical symptoms with other two CoV diseases, severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome (SARS and MERS), of which causative viruses are SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively.
32405236,These three CoVs resulting diseases also share many clinical symptoms with other respiratory diseases caused by influenza A viruses (IAVs).
32405236,Since both CoVs and IAVs are general pathogens responsible for seasonal cold, in the next few months, during the changing of seasons, clinicians and public heath may have to distinguish COVID-19 pneumonia from other kinds of viral pneumonia.
32405236,This is a discussion and comparison of the virus structures, transmission characteristics, clinical symptoms, diagnosis, pathological changes, treatment and prevention of the two kinds of viruses, CoVs and IAVs.
32405236,It hopes to provide information for practitioners in the medical field during the epidemic season.
32405245,We investigated the clinical course of individuals with 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) who were transferred from the Diamond Princess cruise ship to 12 local hospitals.
32405245,The conditions and clinical courses of patients with pneumonia were compared with those of patients without pneumonia.
32405245,Among 70 patients (median age: 67 years) analyzed, the major symptoms were fever (64.3%), cough (54.3%), and general fatigue (24.3%).
32405245,Forty-three patients (61.4%) had pneumonia.
32405245,Higher body temperature, heart rate, and respiratory rate as well as higher of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and lower serum albumin level and lymphocyte count were associated with the presence of pneumonia.
32405245,Ground-glass opacity was found in 97.7% of the patients with pneumonia.
32405245,Patients were administered neuraminidase inhibitors (20%), lopinavir/ritonavir (32.9%), and ciclesonide inhalation (11.4%).
32405245,Mechanical ventilation and veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was performed on 14 (20%) and 2 (2.9%) patients, respectively; two patients died.
32405245,The median duration of intubation was 12 days.
32405245,The patients with COVID-19 transferred to local hospitals during the outbreak had severe conditions and needed close monitoring.
32405245,The severity of COVID-19 depends on the presence of pneumonia.
32405245,High serum LDH, AST and CRP levels and low serum albumin level and lymphocyte count were found to be predictors of pneumonia.
32405245,It was challenging for local hospitals to admit and treat these patients during the outbreak of COVID-19.
32405245,Assessment of severity was crucial to manage a large number of patients.
32405418,The high prevalence of COVID-19 has been paied lots of attention all over the world.
32405418,Nurses are in the first line against this infection and they placed in a high-risk situation.
32405418,This study aimed to report COVID-19 infection during patients care among nures in the Mostafa Khomini Hospital, Ilam, Iran.
32405418,In this hospital 125 nurses were enrolled in COVID-19 center.
32405418,In the present study 5 out of 125 nurses (4%) who enrolled in COVID-19 infection center, were infected with COVID-19.
32405418,They were first positive for real-time PCR but the CT scan was positive for just one of them.
32405418,None of the infected nurses were hospitalized and all of them preferred to be quarantine at home and receive the necessary care and treatment (Oseltamivir, Azithromycin and Kaletra.
32405418,This study showed that regardless of self caring, the nurses were exposed to COVID-19.
32405418,Because at the the beginning of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Iran, there were no special protection against this infection.Therfore they were at risk for the COVID-19.
32405418,This study also reported that receiving the necessary care and treatment at home was a good experience for nurses that can be used in some cases.
32405421,Repurposing broad-spectrum antivirals is an immediate treatment opportunity for 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
32405421,Favipiravir is an antiviral previously indicated for influenza and Ebola, which has shown some promise in early trials for treatment of COVID-19.
32405421,We aim to review existing favipiravir safety evidence, which is vital to informing the potential future use of favipiravir in COVID-19.
32405421,A search was conducted across EMBASE and MEDLINE databases, supplemented by relevant grey-literature and ClinicalTrials.gov.
32405421,All studies assessing the use of favipiravir in humans by 27 March 2020 were considered for inclusion.
32405421,Further analysis of available safety data from phase 2 and 3 studies was undertaken.
32405421,Data extracted were adverse events (AEs) grade 1-4, serious AEs and discontinuation for AEs.
32405421,Specific AEs of interest highlighted in early-phase studies, including gastrointestinal AEs and hyperuricaemia, were also examined.
32405421,Twenty-nine studies were identified as potential sources of evidence of the clinical safety of favipiravir.
32405421,Six were phase 2 and 3 studies reporting relevant safety data for statistical comparison, representing a total of 4299 participants, an estimated 175 person-years-of-follow-up (PYFU).
32405421,Comparator drugs were oseltamivir, umifenovir, lopinavir/ritonavir or placebo.
32405421,Study follow-up was between 5 and 21 days.
32405421,The proportions of grade 1-4 AEs on favipiravir was 28.2% <i>vs</i> 28.4% (<i>P</i> = n.s.) in the comparison arms.
32405421,The proportion of discontinuations due to AEs on favipiravir was 1.1% <i>vs</i> 1.2% (<i>P</i> = n.s.) in the comparison arms.
32405421,For serious AEs the proportion was 0.4% in both arms (<i>P</i> = n.s.).
32405421,There were significantly fewer gastrointestinal AEs occurring on favipiravir <i>vs</i> comparators [8.7% <i>vs</i> 11.5%; <i>P</i> = 0.003].
32405421,Favipiravir showed significantly more uric acid elevations than comparators [5.8% <i>vs</i> 1.3%; <i>P</i>&lt;0.0001].
32405421,Favipiravir demonstrates a favourable safety profile regarding total and serious AEs.
32405421,However, safety concerns remain: hyperuricaemia, teratogenicity and QTc prolongation have not yet been adequately studied.
32405421,Favipiravir may be safe and tolerable in short-term use, but more evidence is needed to assess the longer-term effects of treatment.
32405421,Given the limitations of the evidence and unresolved safety concerns, caution is warranted in the widespread use of favipiravir against pandemic COVID-19.
32405422,Many treatments are being assessed for repurposing to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32405422,One drug that has shown promising results <i>in vitro</i> is nitazoxanide.
32405422,Unlike other postulated drugs, nitazoxanide shows a high ratio of maximum plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>), after 1 day of 500 mg twice daily (BD), to the concentration required to inhibit 50% replication (EC<sub>50</sub>) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (C<sub>max </sub>: EC<sub>50</sub> roughly equal to 14:1).
32405422,As such, it is important to investigate the safety of nitazoxanide for further trials.
32405422,Furthermore, treatments for COVID-19 should be cheap to promote global access, but prices of many drugs are far higher than the costs of production.
32405422,We aimed to conduct a review of the safety of nitazoxanide for any prior indication and calculate its minimum costs of production.
32405422,A review of nitazoxanide clinical research was conducted using EMBASE and MEDLINE databases, supplemented by ClinicalTrials.gov.
32405422,We searched for phase 2 or 3 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing nitazoxanide with placebo or active control for 5-14 days in participants experiencing acute infections of any kind.
32405422,Data extracted were grade 1-4 and serious adverse events (AEs).
32405422,Data were also extracted on gastrointestinal (GI) AEs, as well as hepatorenal and cardiovascular effects.Active pharmaceutical ingredient cost data from 2016 to 2019 were extracted from the Panjiva database and adjusted for 5% loss during production, costs of excipients, formulation, a 10% profit margin and tax.
32405422,Two dosages, at 500 mg BD and a higher dose of 1100 mg three times daily (TDS), were considered.
32405422,Our estimated costs were compared with publicly available list prices from a selection of countries.
32405422,Nine RCTs of nitazoxanide were identified for inclusion.
32405422,These RCTs accounted for 1514 participants and an estimated 95.3 person-years-of-follow-up.
32405422,No significant differences were found in any of the AE endpoints assessed, across all trials or on subgroup analyses of active- or placebo-controlled trials.
32405422,Mild GI AEs increased with dose.
32405422,No hepatorenal or cardiovascular concerns were raised, but few appropriate metrics were reported.
32405422,There were no teratogenic concerns, but the evidence base was very limited.Based on a weighted-mean cost of US $61/kg, a 14-day course of treatment with nitazoxanide 500 mg BD would cost $1.41.
32405422,The daily cost would therefore be $0.10.
32405422,The same 14-day course could cost $3944 in US commercial pharmacies, and $3 per course in Pakistan, India and Bangladesh.
32405422,At a higher dose of 1100 mg TDS, our estimated cost was $4.08 per 14-day course, equivalent to $0.29 per day.
32405422,Nitazoxanide demonstrates a good safety profile at approved doses.
32405422,However, further evidence is required regarding hepatorenal and cardiovascular effects, as well as teratogenicity.
32405422,We estimate that it would be possible to manufacture nitazoxanide as generic for $1.41 for a 14-day treatment course at 500 mg BD, up to $4.08 at 1100 mg TDS.
32405422,Further trials in COVID-19 patients should be initiated.
32405422,If efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 is demonstrated in clinical studies, nitazoxanide may represent a safe and affordable treatment in the ongoing pandemic.
32405423,'Repurposing' existing drugs to treat COVID-19 is vital to reducing mortality and controlling the pandemic.
32405423,Several promising drugs have been identified and are in various stages of clinical trials globally.
32405423,If efficacy of these drugs is demonstrated, rapid, mass availability at an affordable cost would be essential to ensuring equity and access especially amongst low- and middle-income economies.
32405423,Minimum costs of production were estimated from the costs of active pharmaceutical ingredients using established methodology, which had good predictive accuracy for medicines for hepatitis C and HIV amongst others.
32405423,Data were extracted from global export shipment records or analysis of the route of chemical synthesis.
32405423,The estimated costs were compared with list prices from a range of countries where pricing data were available.
32405423,Minimum estimated costs of production were US $0.93/day for remdesivir, $1.45/day for favipiravir, $0.08/day for hydroxychloroquine, $0.02/day for chloroquine, $0.10/day for azithromycin, $0.28/day for lopinavir/ritonavir, $0.39/day for sofosbuvir/daclatasvir and $1.09/day for pirfenidone.
32405423,Costs of production ranged between $0.30 and $31 per treatment course (10-28 days).
32405423,Current prices of these drugs were far higher than the costs of production, particularly in the US.
32405423,Should repurposed drugs demonstrate efficacy against COVID-19, they could be manufactured profitably at very low costs, for much less than current list prices.
32405423,Estimations for the minimum production costs can strengthen price negotiations and help ensure affordable access to vital treatment for COVID-19 at low prices globally.
32405452,To determine whether the course of COVID-19 is more severe in patients with MS and if MS disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) affect the risk of contracting the disease.
32405452,In a cross-sectional survey, data were collected by sending a questionnaire to 2000 patients with a demyelinating disease through an online portal system.
32405452,Collected data included the current MS DMT and patient-reported disability level, history of recent sick contact, recent fever, respiratory symptoms, diagnosis with COVID-19, and the disposition after the diagnosis.
32405452,We defined a COVID-19-suspect group as patients having fever and cough or fever and shortness of breath, or a presumptive diagnosis based on suggestive chest computed tomography.
32405452,We calculated the proportion of COVID-19-suspect patients and compared their demographics, clinical characteristics, and DMT categories with the rest of survey-responders, using univariable and multivariable models.
32405452,Out of 712 patients, 34 (4.8%) fulfilled our criteria for being in the COVID-19-suspect group.
32405452,Only two patients required hospitalization.
32405452,No patient required intensive care.
32405452,In a multivariable model, disease duration (p-value=0.017), DMT category (p-value=0.030), and history of sick contact (p-values&lt;0.001) were associated with the risk of being in the COVID-19-suspect group.
32405452,Being on B-cell depleting antibodies (as compared to non-cell depleting, non-cell trafficking inhibitor DMTs) was associated with a 2.6-fold increase in the risk of being in the COVID-19-suspect group.
32405452,(RR: 3.55, 95%CI: 1.45, 8.68, p-value=0.005).
32405452,The course of infection in patients with MS suspected of having COVID-19 was mild to moderate, and all patients had a full recovery.
32405452,B-cell depleting antibodies may increase the susceptibility to contracting COVID-19.
32405454,We reported a 33-year-old female case with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) accompanied by Acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
32405454,She had a gestational age of 34 weeks.
32405454,The patient referred to treatment clinic for COVID-19 in Imam Reza hospital of Tabriz (Iran) after having flu-like symptoms.
32405454,In radiologic assessment, ground glass opacity (GGO) with consolidation was found in upper right lobe.
32405454,Lopinavir/ritonavir (200mg/50mg) two tablet tow times, Ribavirin 200mg every six hours, and Oseltamivir 75mg tow times were given for the treatment of COVID-19.
32405454,The medications used for treatment of pneumonia were Meropenem, Ciprofloxacin, Vancomycin.
32405454,All doses of medications were administrated by adjusted dose assuming the patient is anephric.
32405454,Also, a few supplements were also given after ATN development including daily Rocaltrol and Nephrovit (as a multivitamin appropriate for patients with renal failure), Folic acid and Calcium carbonate.
32405454,The patient is still under ventilator with a Fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>) of 60% and Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of eight.
32405454,SpO<sub>2</sub> is 94% but the patient's ATN problem has been resolved.
32405454,We started weaning from mechanical ventilator.
32405454,The patient is conscious with full awareness to time, person and place.
32405454,The maternal well-being is achieved and her neonate was discharged.
32405509,The leading risk factor for <i>Clostridioides</i> (<i>Clostridium</i>) <i>difficile</i> infection (CDI) is broad-spectrum antibiotics, which lead to low microbial diversity, or dysbiosis.
32405509,Current therapeutic strategies for CDI are insufficient, as they do not address the key role of the microbiome in preventing <i>C. difficile</i> spore germination into toxin-producing vegetative bacteria, which leads to symptomatic disease.
32405509,Fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) appears to reduce the risk of recurrent CDI through microbiome restoration.
32405509,However, a wide range of efficacy rates have been reported, and few placebo-controlled trials have been conducted, limiting our understanding of FMT efficacy and safety.
32405509,We discuss the current knowledge gaps driven by questions around the quality and consistency of clinical trial results, patient selection, diagnostic methodologies, use of suppressive antibiotic therapy, and methods for adverse event reporting.
32405509,We provide specific recommendations for future trial designs of FMT to provide improved quality of the clinical evidence to better inform treatment guidelines.
32405620,Since the World has been facing the COVID-19 pandemic, special attention has been taken concerning cancer patients; related to their immunosuppression status, adding risk for more aggressive COVID-19 and mortality, but also concerns about the access and the quality of care in cancer therapy.
32405620,The COVID-19 pandemic impacts the number of infected, its related mortality, as well as the care of cancer patients.
32405620,Multiple myeloma patients are a particular group with several important aspects to be considered during pandemic times.
32405620,In essence, they are immunosuppressed in different intensities during their treatment.
32405620,Most of them are elderly and all of them require long-term therapy, with prolonged contact with the health care system, possibly including a stem cell transplant during the treatment.
32405620,A panel of experts in multiple myeloma and infectious diseases discusses pieces of evidence and the lack of the same in the scenario of COVID-19 in myeloma patients, while also exposing what is expected for the next phases of the COVID-19 pandemic.
32405622,The ongoing outbreak of the novel coronavirus pneumonia COVID-19 has caused great number of cases and deaths, but our understanding about the pathogen SARS-CoV-2 remains largely unclear.
32405622,The attachment of the virus with the cell-surface receptor and a cofactor is the first step for the infection.
32405622,Here, bioinformatics approaches combining human-virus protein interaction prediction and protein docking based on crystal structures have revealed the high affinity between human dipeptidylpeptidase 4 (DPP4) and the spike (S) receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2.
32405622,Intriguingly, the crucial binding residues of DPP4 are identical to those that are bound to the MERS-CoV-S.
32405622,Moreover, E484 insertion and adjacent substitutions should be most essential for this DPP4-binding ability acquirement of SARS-CoV-2-S compared with SARS-CoV-S.
32405622,This potential utilization of DPP4 as a binding target for SARS-CoV-2 may offer novel insight into the viral pathogenesis and help the surveillance and therapeutics strategy for meeting the challenge of COVID-19.
32405629,COVID-19 has now been declared a global pandemic with evolving incidence rates and fatalities.
32405629,It is important to identify vulnerable populations who will be impacted most by this pandemic leading to higher mortality rates compared to the general healthy population.
32405629,Although older patients and patients with co-morbidities fall into this vulnerable group, patients with hematologic and oncologic malignancies on active cytotoxic treatments are at even greater risk as they are both myelosuppressed and immunosuppressed.
32405629,In addition to following the universal guidelines recommended by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), it is important to also institute guidelines for cancer centers to help protect this vulnerable population.
32405629,We review the current data, risks, and recommendations for COVID-19 in cancer patients.
32405641,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses an unprecedented challenge to healthcare worldwide.
32405641,The infection can be life threatening and require intensive care treatment.
32405641,The transmission of the disease poses a risk to both patients and healthcare workers.
32405641,The number of patients requiring hospital admission and intensive care may overwhelm health systems and negatively affect standard care for patients presenting with conditions needing emergency interventions.
32405641,This position statements aims to assist cardiologists in the invasive management of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.
32405641,To that end, we assembled a panel of interventional cardiologists and acute cardiac care specialists appointed by the European Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions (EAPCI) and from the Acute Cardiovascular Care Association (ACVC) and included the experience from the first and worst affected areas in Europe.
32405641,Modified diagnostic and treatment algorithms are proposed to adapt evidence-based protocols for this unprecedented challenge.
32405641,Various clinical scenarios, as well as management algorithms for patients with a diagnosed or suspected COVID-19 infection, presenting with ST- and non-ST-segment elevation ACS are described.
32405641,In addition, we address the need for re-organization of ACS networks, with redistribution of hub and spoke hospitals, as well as for in-hospital reorganization of emergency rooms and cardiac units, with examples coming from multiple European countries.
32405641,Furthermore, we provide a guidance to reorganization of catheterization laboratories and, importantly, measures for protection of healthcare providers involved with invasive procedures.
32405780,As of March 10, 2020, more than 100,000 novel coronavirus pneumonia cases have been confirmed globally.
32405780,With the continuous spread of the new coronavirus pneumonia epidemic in even the world, prevention and treatment of the disease have become urgent tasks.
32405780,The drugs currently being developed are not adequate to deal with this critical situation.
32405780,In addition to being controlled through effective isolation, we need a rapid response from the healthcare and biotechnology industries to accelerate drug treatment research.
32405780,By reviewing the currently available literature published at home and abroad, we summarize the current research progress of drug treatment during the epidemic period.
32405780,At present, the drugs that can be used for treatment mainly include antiviral drugs, antimalarials, glucocorticoids, plasma therapy, biological agents, and traditional Chinese medicine.
32405780,The effectiveness and safety of drug therapy need to be confirmed by more clinical studies.
32405783,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has emerged as one of the greatest challenges faced by humankind in the recent past.
32405783,People with diabetes and related comorbidities are at increased risk of its complications and of COVID-19-related death.
32405783,Older age, multi-morbidity, hyperglycaemia, cardiac injury and severe inflammatory response are predictors of poor outcome.
32405783,The complex interplay between COVID-19, diabetes and the effects of related therapies is being explored.
32405783,Most patients experience a mild illness with COVID-19, while people with diabetes are at increased risk of severe disease.
32405783,Optimising glycaemic control and adopting measures to prevent disease spread are critical aspects.
32405783,The management of mild disease is supportive, while very many immunomodulatory and antiviral therapies are being investigated for the treatment of severe disease.
32405783,Several of these agents have specific considerations for use in people with diabetes.
32405783,Since mass population lockdowns are considered a key step in controlling disease spread, it follows that, in addition to the direct vulnerability to severe COVID-19, people with diabetes can be affected by limited access to healthcare, insulin, other medications and blood glucose monitoring equipment.
32405783,Measures to prevent disease spread at the individual and community level are the key to mitigating the rapidly escalating pandemic, while agents for chemoprophylaxis and vaccines are being explored.
32405783,People with diabetes should be recognised as a vulnerable group for complicated disease and are at risk during times of disturbed social systems.
32405783,Strategies are needed to safeguard the health of patients with diabetes during the pandemic.
32405783,This review summarises the current knowledge and perceived challenges for prevention and management of COVID-19 in people with diabetes.
32405877,COVID-19 presentation may include a profound increase in cytokines and associated pneumonia, rapidly progressing to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
32405877,This so-called cytokine storm often leads to refractory edema, respiratory arrest, and death.
32405877,At present, anti-IL-6, antiviral therapy, convalescent plasma, hydroxychloroquine, and azithromycin among others are being investigated as potential treatments for COVID-19.
32405877,As the disease etiology and precise therapeutic interventions are still not definitively defined, we wanted to review the roles that complement and the contact system may have in either the treatment or pathogenesis of the disease.
32405877,We searched the recent literature (PubMed) on complement and coronavirus; contact system and coronavirus; bradykinin and coronavirus; and angiotensin receptor and coronavirus.
32405877,The manuscript complies with ethics guidelines and was deemed exempt from institutional review board approval according to Human Subjects Protection Office guidelines.
32405877,Mouse models are available for the study of coronavirus and complement.
32405877,Although complement is effective in protecting against many viruses, it does not seem to be protective against coronavirus.
32405877,C3 knockout mice infected with SARS-CoV had less lung disease than wild-type mice, suggesting that complement may play a role in coronavirus pathogenesis.
32405877,Some evidence suggests that the observed pulmonary edema may be bradykinin-induced and could be the reason that corticosteroids, antihistamines, and other traditional interventions for edema are not effective.
32405877,Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a co-receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and studies thus far have not concluded a benefit or risk associated with the use of either ACE-inhibitors or angiotensin receptor antagonists.
32405877,Activation of complement and the contact system, through generation of bradykinin, may play a role in the SARS-CoV-2-induced pulmonary edema, and our search suggests that further work is necessary to confirm our suspicions.
32405882,We describe the case of a 73-year-old woman who was diagnosed with herpes simplex virus-1 encephalitis during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32405882,The diagnosis was somehow delayed because relatives were initially cautious in bringing the patient to the hospital and, here, the work-up focus was on coronavirusrelated aspects as the patient was initially reputed to be infected with COVID-19.
32405882,During the current viral outbreak, physicians should not neglect the possibility of other diseases that represent neurological emergencies and require immediate recognition and treatment.
32405913,It has been pointed out that the second paragraph of the section &quot;Treatments for SARS-CoV-2 Infection&quot; contains an error.
32405913,The original article has been corrected.
32405955,The current worldwide severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has brought some medical systems to the brink of collapse.
32405955,This crisis is also negatively impacting the care of patients with non-COVID-19 conditions, including those with cerebellar ataxia (CA).
32405955,Older patients with CA and those with immune-mediated ataxias on immunosuppressive medication are potentially at high risk of developing serious complications of the infection, although it is also possible that immunosuppressive agents may provide a defense against cytokine storm.
32405955,This has implications for even greater attention to preventing contracting the disease through physical distancing and/or isolation.
32405955,The CA patient population is also at higher risk because of the neurological complexities of their underlying disorder and the comorbid medical illnesses that often accompany the genetic ataxias.
32405955,As the disruption of social patterns and healthcare delivery in response to the crisis continues, interruption of rehabilitation, speech and language therapy, and face-to-face consultations threatens to have a negative impact on the course and well-being of CA patients.
32405955,Mental and physical health is also potentially at greater risk because the prevailing uncertainty and anxiety may be superimposed upon cerebellum-specific neuropsychological challenges.
32405955,We identify and review some of the short- and long-term consequences of this global pandemic for the community of ataxia patients and their families and for the clinical and academic neurologists/ataxiologists caring for these patients.
32405955,This includes the recognition that telemedicine has emerged as a principle means of caregiver-patient contact and that neurological manifestations of COVID-19 including those specific to cerebellar neurobiology are increasingly recognized and will require close surveillance and monitoring.
32405955,This COVID-19 Cerebellum Task Force consensus provides some guidance on how we may approach this uncertain time and consider preparing for the new realities we face in CA patient care once this acute crisis has passed.
32405974,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious disease and a serious threat to human health.
32405974,COVID-19 can cause multiple organ dysfunction, such as respiratory and circulatory failure, liver and kidney injury, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and thromboembolism, and even death.
32405974,The World Health Organization reports that the mortality rate of severe-type COVID-19 is over 50%.
32405974,Currently, the number of severe cases worldwide has increased rapidly, but the experience in the treatment of infected patients is still limited.
32405974,Given the lack of specific antiviral drugs, multi-organ function support treatment is important for patients with COVID-19.
32405974,To improve the cure rate and reduce the mortality of patients with severe- and critical-type COVID-19, this paper summarizes the experience of organ function support in patients with severe- and critical-type COVID-19 in Optical Valley Branch of Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China.
32405974,This paper systematically summarizes the procedures of functional support therapies for multiple organs and systems, including respiratory, circulatory, renal, hepatic, and hematological systems, among patients with severe- and critical-type COVID-19.
32405974,This paper provides a clinical reference and a new strategy for the optimal treatment of COVID-19 worldwide.
32406115,We have recently argued that, because microbes have pervasive - often vital - influences on our lives, and that therefore their roles must be taken into account in many of the decisions we face, society must become microbiology-literate, through the introduction of relevant microbiology topics in school curricula (Timmis et al.
32406115,2019.
32406115,Environ Microbiol 21: 1513-1528).
32406115,The current coronavirus pandemic is a stark example of why microbiology literacy is such a crucial enabler of informed policy decisions, particularly those involving preparedness of public-health systems for disease outbreaks and pandemics.
32406115,However, a significant barrier to attaining widespread appreciation of microbial contributions to our well-being and that of the planet is the fact that microbes are seldom visible: most people are only peripherally aware of them, except when they fall ill with an infection.
32406115,And it is disease, rather than all of the positive activities mediated by microbes, that colours public perception of 'germs' and endows them with their poor image.
32406115,It is imperative to render microbes visible, to give them life and form for children (and adults), and to counter prevalent misconceptions, through exposure to imagination-capturing images of microbes and examples of their beneficial outputs, accompanied by a balanced narrative.
32406115,This will engender automatic mental associations between everyday information inputs, as well as visual, olfactory and tactile experiences, on the one hand, and the responsible microbes/microbial communities, on the other hand.
32406115,Such associations, in turn, will promote awareness of microbes and of the many positive and vital consequences of their actions, and facilitate and encourage incorporation of such consequences into relevant decision-making processes.
32406115,While teaching microbiology topics in primary and secondary school is key to this objective, a strategic programme to expose children directly and personally to natural and managed microbial processes, and the results of their actions, through carefully planned class excursions to local venues, can be instrumental in bringing microbes to life for children and, collaterally, their families.
32406115,In order to encourage the embedding of microbiology-centric class excursions in current curricula, we suggest and illustrate here some possibilities relating to the topics of food (a favourite pre-occupation of most children), agriculture (together with horticulture and aquaculture), health and medicine, the environment and biotechnology.
32406115,And, although not all of the microbially relevant infrastructure will be within reach of schools, there is usually access to a market, local food store, wastewater treatment plant, farm, surface water body, etc., all of which can provide opportunities to explore microbiology in action.
32406115,If children sometimes consider the present to be mundane, even boring, they are usually excited with both the past and the future so, where possible, visits to local museums (the past) and research institutions advancing knowledge frontiers (the future) are strongly recommended, as is a tapping into the natural enthusiasm of local researchers to leverage the educational value of excursions and virtual excursions.
32406115,Children are also fascinated by the unknown, so, paradoxically, the invisibility of microbes makes them especially fascinating objects for visualization and exploration.
32406115,In outlining some of the options for microbiology excursions, providing suggestions for discussion topics and considering their educational value, we strive to extend the vistas of current class excursions and to: (i) inspire teachers and school managers to incorporate more microbiology excursions into curricula; (ii) encourage microbiologists to support school excursions and generally get involved in bringing microbes to life for children; (iii) urge leaders of organizations (biopharma, food industries, universities, etc.) to give school outreach activities a more prominent place in their mission portfolios, and (iv) convey to policymakers the benefits of providing schools with funds, materials and flexibility for educational endeavours beyond the classroom.
32406211,Clusters of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in long-term care facilities (LTCFs) have been widely reported in the Korea and around the world.
32406211,COVID-19 has a high mortality rate, and older patients and those with underlying diseases are at particularly high risk of being infected.
32406211,Outbreaks in LTCFs, where many high-risk patients reside, result in the occupation of beds meant for severely ill patients and even death in many patients.
32406211,Long-term care hospitals (LTCH) are major LTCFs in Korea.
32406211,Therefore, it is very important to protect patients in LTCHs from COVID-19.
32406211,The reality is that preparedness for COVID-19 in LTCHs is inadequate, and there are barriers to improvements in preparedness.
32406211,Through institutional improvement and policy support, the government should help healthcare personnel and LTCHs improve installation and raise the level of knowledge of infection prevention and control.
32406211,With these improvement, prevention, surveillance, and screening for COVID-19 should be done and a response system to the COVID-19 outbreak should be established.
32406211,There are many challenges that must be overcome to meet the goals proposed in this article.
32406211,This may be possible only with a spirit of solidarity and cooperation of government, public and private healthcare facilities.
32406305,The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has severely affected the medical community and stopped the world in its tracks.
32406305,This review aims to provide the basic information necessary for us, orthopaedic surgeons to prepare ourselves to face this pandemic together.
32406305,Herein, we cover the background of COVID-19, presentation, investigations, transmission, infection control and touch upon emerging treatments.
32406305,It is of paramount importance that we should stay vigilant for our patients, our families and ourselves.
32406305,Adequate infection control measures are necessary during day-to-day clinical work.
32406317,The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which was first reported in Wuhan province of China, has become a deadly pandemic causing alarmingly high morbidity and mortality.
32406317,In the absence of new targeted drugs and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 at present, the choices for effective treatments are limited.
32406317,Therefore, considering the exigency of the situation, we focused on identifying the available approved drugs as potential inhibitor against the promising Coronavirus drug target, the Main Protease, using computer-aided methods.
32406317,We created a library of U.
32406317,S.
32406317,Food and Drug Administration approved anti-microbial drugs and virtually screened it against the available crystal structures of Main Protease of the virus.
32406317,The study revealed that Viomycin showed the highest -CDocker energy after docking at the active site of SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease.
32406317,It is noteworthy that Viomycin showed higher -CDocker energy as compared to the drugs currently under clinical trial for SARS-CoV-2 treatment <i>viz.</i> Ritonavir and Lopinavir.
32406317,Additionally, Viomycin formed higher number of H-bonds with SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease than its co-crystallised inhibitor compound N3.
32406317,Molecular dynamics simulation further showed that Viomycin embedded deeply inside the binding pocket and formed robust binding with SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease.
32406317,Therefore, we propose that Viomycin may act as a potential inhibitor of the Main Protease of SARS-CoV-2.
32406317,Further optimisations with the drug may support the much-needed rapid response to mitigate the pandemic.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

32406348,Meditation and mindfulness are practices that can support healthcare professionals, patients, carers and the general public during times of crisis such as the current global pandemic caused by Covid-19.
32406348,While there are many forms of meditation and mindfulness, of particular interest to healthcare professionals are those with an evidence base such as Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR).
32406348,Systematic reviews of such practices have shown improvements in measures of anxiety, depression and pain scores.
32406348,Structural and functional brain changes have been demonstrated in the brains of people with a long term traditional meditation practice, and in people who have completed a MBSR programme.
32406348,Mindfulness and meditation practices translate well to different populations across the life span and range of ability.
32406348,Introducing a mindfulness and meditation practice during this pandemic has the potential to complement treatment and is a low cost beneficial method of providing support with anxiety for all.
32406369,The ongoing pandemic COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has already resulted in more than 3 million cases and more than 200,000 deaths globally.
32406369,Significant clinical presentations of COVID-19 include respiratory symptoms and pneumonia.
32406369,In a minority of patients, extrapulmonary organs (central nervous system, eyes, heart, and gut) are affected, with detection of viral RNA in bodily secretions (stool, tears, and saliva).
32406369,Infection of such extrapulmonary organs may serve as a reservoir for SARS-CoV-2, representing a potential source of viral shedding after the cessation of respiratory symptoms in recovered patients or in asymptomatic individuals.
32406369,It is extremely important to understand this phenomenon, as individuals with intermittent virus shedding could be falsely identified as reinfected and may benefit from ongoing antiviral treatment.
32406369,The potential of SARS-CoV-2 infection to rapidly disseminate and infect extrapulmonary organs is likely mediated through the nonstructural and accessory proteins of SARS-CoV-2, which act as ligands for host cells, and through evasion of host immune responses.
32406369,The focus of this perspective is the extrapulmonary tissues affected by SARS-CoV-2 and the potential implications of their involvement for disease pathogenesis and the development of medical countermeasures.
32406381,The timely and accurate diagnosis of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), remains the cornerstone of efforts to provide appropriated treatment for patients, to limit further spread of the virus and ultimately to eliminate the virus from the human society.
32406381,We focus this article on (a) developments for improvement of diagnosis of specific SARS-CoV-2 virus, (b) laboratory changes in the immunologic and coagulation system, (c) therapeutic options for anticoagulant treatment of seriously affected patients and (d) on the perspectives through improvement of diagnostic and therapeutic medical procedures.
32406395,As there is no vaccination and proper medicine for treatment, the recent pandemic caused by COVID-19 has drawn attention to the strategies of quarantine and other governmental measures, like lockdown, media coverage on social isolation, and improvement of public hygiene, etc to control the disease.
32406395,The mathematical model can help when these intervention measures are the best strategies for disease control as well as how they might affect the disease dynamics.
32406395,Motivated by this, in this article, we have formulated a mathematical model introducing a quarantine class and governmental intervention measures to mitigate disease transmission.
32406395,We study a thorough dynamical behavior of the model in terms of the basic reproduction number.
32406395,Further, we perform the sensitivity analysis of the essential reproduction number and found that reducing the contact of exposed and susceptible humans is the most critical factor in achieving disease control.
32406395,To lessen the infected individuals as well as to minimize the cost of implementing government control measures, we formulate an optimal control problem, and optimal control is determined.
32406395,Finally, we forecast a short-term trend of COVID-19 for the three highly affected states, Maharashtra, Delhi, and Tamil Nadu, in India, and it suggests that the first two states need further monitoring of control measures to reduce the contact of exposed and susceptible humans.
32406512,In a large Israeli dataset of 14 520 individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2, angiotension-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers were not found to be associated with increased SARS-CoV-2 infection after adjusting for major confounders.
32406512,Patients on these medications should not stop their medication prophylactically.
32406687,Currently, the new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic without any well-calibrated treatment.
32406687,To inactivate the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19, the main protease (Mpro) that performs key biological functions in the virus has been the focus of extensive studies.
32406687,With the fast-response experimental efforts, the crystal structures of Mpro of the SARS-CoV-2 virus have just become available recently.
32406687,Herein, we theoretically investigated the mechanism of binding between the Mpro's pocket and various marketed drug molecules being tested in clinics to fight COVID-19 that show promising outcomes.
32406687,By combining the existing experimental results with our computational ones, we revealed an important ligand binding mechanism of the Mpro, demonstrating that the binding stability of a ligand inside the Mpro pocket can be significantly improved if part of the ligand occupies its so-called &quot;anchor&quot; site.
32406687,Along with the highly potent drugs and/or molecules (such as nelfinavir) revealed in this study, the newly discovered binding mechanism paves the way for further optimizations and designs of Mpro's inhibitors with a high binding affinity.
32406853,The current COVID19 pandemic is holding the world in its grip.
32406853,Epidemiologist has shown that the mortality risks are higher when the health care system falls under the COVID19 pressure.
32406853,It is, therefore, of great importance to keep health care providers (HCP) healthy and prevent contamination.
32406853,An important group who will be confronted with the treatment of COVID19 positive patients are HCP during (semi) acute surgery.
32406853,There are concerns that laparoscopic surgery increases the risk of contamination more than open surgery, therefore balancing the safety of HCP with the benefit of laparoscopic surgery for the patient.
32406853,To provide an overview of potential contamination routes, possible risks for HCP, and propose research questions based on current literature and expert opinions about laparoscopic surgery on a COVID19 positive patient.
32406853,We performed a scoping review adding five additional questions concerning possible contaminating routes.
32406853,A systematic search was performed on Pubmed, CINAHL, and Embase databases adding results from gray literature as well.
32406853,The search was not only for COVID-19 but extended with virus contamination in general.
32406853,We excluded society and professional association statements about COVID-19 if they did not add new insights into the available literature.
32406853,The initial search provide 2.007 records, after which 267 full-text papers were considered.
32406853,Finally, we used 84 papers of which 14 were discussing SARS-CoV-2.
32406853,Eight papers discuss the added value of performing intubation in a low-pressure operating room, mainly based on the SARS outbreak experience from 2003.
32406853,Thirteen papers elaborate on the risks of intubation for the HCP and SARS-CoV-2 and 19 papers discuss this situation with other viruses.
32406853,They conclude that there is significant evidence that in- and extubation is a high-risk aerosol producing procedure.
32406853,No papers were found on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 and surgical smoke, although 25 papers did provide conflicting evidence on the infection risk of HPV, hepatitis B, polio, and rabies.
32406853,There were no papers found discussing tissue extraction or the deflation risk of the pneumoperitoneum after laparoscopic surgery.
32406853,There seems to be consensus in the literature that in- and extubation is a high-risk procedure for the HCP and that maximum protective equipment is needed.
32406853,On the other hand, minimal evidence is available discussing the actual risk of contamination of the HCP during laparoscopy itself.
32406853,Neither on operating room pressure, surgical smoke, tissue extraction, nor CO2 deflation.
32406853,But there are new studies published daily from current experiences and society statements are continuously updated.
32406853,There seems no reason to abandon laparoscopic surgery over open surgery.
32406853,But do not underestimate the risks, perform surgery on COVID-19 positive patients only when necessary, and keep using logical and common sense to protect yourself and others by performing surgery in a safe and protected environment.
32406873,In December 2019, in the city of Wuhan, in the Hubei province of China, treatment-resistant cases of pneumonia emerged and spread rapidly for reasons unknown.
32406873,A new strain of coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 [SARS-CoV-2]) was identified and caused the first pandemic of the 21st century.
32406873,The virus was officially detected in our country on March 11, 2020, and the number of cases increased rapidly; the virus was isolated in 670 patients within 10 days.
32406873,The rapid increase in the number of patients has required our physicians to learn to protect both the public and themselves when treating patients with this highly infectious disease.
32406873,The group most affected by the outbreak and with the highest mortality rate is elderly patients with known cardiovascular disease.
32406873,Therefore, it is necessary for cardiology specialists to take an active role in combating the epidemic.
32406873,The aim of this article is to make a brief assessment of current information regarding the management of cardiovascular patients affected by COVID-19 and to provide practical suggestions to cardiology specialists about problems and questions they have frequently encountered.
32406927,Convalescent plasma and hyperimmune immunoglobulin may reduce mortality in patients with respiratory virus diseases, and are currently being investigated in trials as a potential therapy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32406927,A thorough understanding of the current body of evidence regarding the benefits and risks is required.
32406927,OBJECTIVES: To assess whether convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin transfusion is effective and safe in the treatment of people with COVID-19.
32406927,The protocol was pre-published with the Center for Open Science and can be accessed here: osf.io/dwf53  We searched the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 Global Research Database, MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 Research Article Database and trials registries to identify ongoing studies and results of completed studies on 23 April 2020 for case-series, cohort, prospectively planned, and randomised controlled trials (RCTs).
32406927,We followed standard Cochrane methodology and performed all steps regarding study selection in duplicate by two independent review authors (in contrast to the recommendations of the Cochrane Rapid Reviews Methods Group).
32406927,We included studies evaluating convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin for people with COVID-19, irrespective of disease severity, age, gender or ethnicity.
32406927,We excluded studies including populations with other coronavirus diseases (severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)) and studies evaluating standard immunoglobulins.
32406927,We followed recommendations of the Cochrane Rapid Reviews Methods Group regarding data extraction and assessment.
32406927,To assess bias in included studies, we used the assessment criteria tool for observational studies, provided by Cochrane Childhood Cancer.
32406927,We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for the following outcomes: all-cause mortality at hospital discharge, improvement of clinical symptoms (7, 15, and 30 days after transfusion), grade 3 and 4 adverse events, and serious adverse events.
32406927,MAIN RESULTS: We included eight studies (seven case-series, one prospectively planned, single-arm intervention study) with 32 participants, and identified a further 48 ongoing studies evaluating convalescent plasma (47 studies) or hyperimmune immunoglobulin (one study), of which 22 are randomised.
32406927,Overall risk of bias of the eight included studies was high, due to: study design; small number of participants; poor reporting within studies; and varied type of participants with different severities of disease, comorbidities, and types of previous or concurrent treatments, including antivirals, antifungals or antibiotics, corticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine and respiratory support.
32406927,We rated all outcomes as very low certainty, and we were unable to summarise numerical data in any meaningful way.
32406927,As we identified case-series studies only, we reported results narratively.
32406927,Effectiveness of convalescent plasma for people with COVID-19 The following reported outcomes could all be related to the underlying natural history of the disease or other concomitant treatment, rather than convalescent plasma.
32406927,All-cause mortality at hospital discharge All studies reported mortality.
32406927,All participants were alive at the end of the reporting period, but not all participants had been discharged from hospital by the end of the study (15 participants discharged, 6 still hospitalised, 11 unclear).
32406927,Follow-up ranged from 3 days to 37 days post-transfusion.
32406927,We do not know whether convalescent plasma therapy affects mortality (very low-certainty evidence).
32406927,Improvement of clinical symptoms (assessed by respiratory support) Six studies, including 28 participants, reported the level of respiratory support required; most participants required respiratory support at baseline.
32406927,All studies reported improvement in clinical symptoms in at least some participants.
32406927,We do not know whether convalescent plasma improves clinical symptoms (very low-certainty evidence).
32406927,Time to discharge from hospital Six studies reported time to discharge from hospital for at least some participants, which ranged from four to 35 days after convalescent plasma therapy.
32406927,Admission on the intensive care unit (ICU) Six studies included patients who were critically ill.
32406927,At final follow-up the majority of these patients were no longer on the ICU or no longer required mechanical ventilation.
32406927,Length of stay on the ICU Only one study (1 participant) reported length of stay on the ICU.
32406927,The individual was discharged from the ICU 11 days after plasma transfusion.
32406927,Safety of convalescent plasma for people with COVID-19 Grade 3 or 4 adverse events  The studies did not report the grade of adverse events after convalescent plasma transfusion.
32406927,Two studies reported data relating to participants who had experienced adverse events, that were presumably grade 3 or 4.
32406927,One case study reported a participant who had moderate fever (38.9 °C).
32406927,Another study (3 participants) reported a case of severe anaphylactic shock.
32406927,Four studies reported the absence of moderate or severe adverse events (19 participants).
32406927,We are very uncertain whether or not convalescent plasma therapy affects the risk of moderate to severe adverse events (very low-certainty evidence).
32406927,Serious adverse events One study (3 participants) reported one serious adverse event.
32406927,As described above, this individual had severe anaphylactic shock after receiving convalescent plasma.
32406927,Six studies reported that no serious adverse events occurred.
32406927,We are very uncertain whether or not convalescent plasma therapy affects the risk of serious adverse events (very low-certainty evidence).
32406927,AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We identified eight studies (seven case-series and one prospectively planned single-arm intervention study) with a total of 32 participants (range 1 to 10).
32406927,Most studies assessed the risks of the intervention; reporting two adverse events (potentially grade 3 or 4), one of which was a serious adverse event.
32406927,We are very uncertain whether convalescent plasma is effective for people admitted to hospital with COVID-19 as studies reported results inconsistently, making it difficult to compare results and to draw conclusions.
32406927,We identified very low-certainty evidence on the effectiveness and safety of convalescent plasma therapy for people with COVID-19; all studies were at high risk of bias and reporting quality was low.
32406927,No RCTs or controlled non-randomised studies evaluating benefits and harms of convalescent plasma have been completed.
32406927,There are 47 ongoing studies evaluating convalescent plasma, of which 22 are RCTs, and one trial evaluating hyperimmune immunoglobulin.
32406927,We will update this review as a living systematic review, based on monthly searches in the above mentioned databases and registries.
32406927,These updates are likely to show different results to those reported here.
32406985,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a pandemic that is evolving rapidly at present with unprecedented global health and societal implications.
32406985,Herein, we report a case of successful treatment of SARS-CoV-2 induced inflammatory syndrome by utilization of the interleukin-6 receptor antagonist (IL-6Ra) tocilizumab.
32407051,Currently, there are no approved specific antiviral agents for novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
32407051,Hyper-immune/convalescent plasma derived from recently recovered donors seems to be useful to treat COVID-19 patients, an addition to maximal supportive care and antiviral agents.
32407051,The endpoints are the improvement of clinical symptoms and laboratory parameters of these patients.
32407051,However, the efficacy of hyper-immune/convalescent plasma treatment for severe infectious diseases is still controversial.
32407051,The optimal dose and time point, as well as the clinical benefit of hyper- immune/convalescent plasma therapy, needs further investigation in larger well-controlled trials.
32407142,Bad advice can lead to tragedy, such as death from taking an unproven medication.<sup>1</sup> Now, more than ever, public health policies should be based on the best available evidence.
32407142,Consumers, clinicians, and policymakers need balanced information that is free of commercial influence to make decisions about the best ways to prevent the spread and manage the symptoms and clinical consequences of COVID-19.
32407142,The benefits and harms of each decision must be considered.
32407142,Public health measures such as isolation, quarantine, and social distancing have fundamentally changed the way we live. (<i>Am J Public Health</i>.

32407178,The COVID-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc and created challenges in various subspecialty training programs, including hematology/oncology fellowship programs.
32407178,The challenge of social distancing, providing care for those infected by COVID-19, continuing appropriate treatment of time-sensitive diseases, and the looming threat of health care worker infections required swift planning and restructuring of training programs.
32407178,The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education provided leeway to tackle the challenges faced by institutions and training programs in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic.
32407178,Currently, there is no established guideline specific to hematology and oncology fellowship programs.
32407178,While understanding that there is no one-size-fits-all, shared experiences can assist training programs to incorporate best practices and customize their programs to provide an active educational environment that balances patient care needs, didactics, scholarly activities, and wellbeing during the process of rapid changes and adaptation.
32407178,We share our hematology/oncology fellowship program's restructuring approach in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
32407289,As of 12th April 2020, a total of 389 cases of COVID-19 were confirmed in Jordan.
32407289,To control this imminent threat, Jordan has enforced public health infection prevention and control measures, called for social distancing, seized all forms of inbound and outbound movement/ international travel, and enacted the Defence Law that transferred the authority to Minister of Defence to work and formulate orders according to the situation.
32407289,In an effort to support the government in anticipating the requirements of the health system in the upcoming period, an in-depth reflection and examination of different scenarios of the disease spread were developed.
32407289,This viewpoint suggested different strategies and measures for case detection and contact tracing, clinical management of cases, public health system functioning, and civil society organizations contribution.
32407289,It is necessary to accelerate containment of the disease to protect the economy and to maintain the continuity of some activities to mitigate the subsequent social, economic and financial impacts.
32407289,This requires finding a coping mechanism for a period that may be prolonged until laboratories develop a vaccine.
32407289,In specific, it is strongly recommended to promote community health awareness towards public health prevention and control measures, increase the efficiency and comprehensiveness of the epidemiological investigation/ active and passive surveillance, and employ technology and digital health solutions to track cases and contacts.
32407289,It is also recommended to increase and expand resources of intensive care units including respirators, increase the capacity and the number of trained health staff in the area of public health and epidemiology, ensure continued provision of essential public health programs and mobilize the resources of non-governmental sector and donors to provide services for refugees and vulnerable populations.
32407459,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic spread globally in the beginning of 2020.
32407459,At present, predictors of severe disease and the efficacy of different treatments are not well-understood.
32407459,We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of all published studies up to March 15, 2020 which reported COVID-19 clinical features and/or treatment outcomes. 45 studies reporting 4203 patients were included.
32407459,Pooled rates of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mortality and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) were 10.9%, 4.3% and 18.4%, respectively.
32407459,On meta-regression, ICU admission was predicted by raised leukocyte count (p&lt;0.0001), raised alanine aminotransferase (p=0.024), raised aspartate transaminase (p=0.0040), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (p&lt;0.0001) and increased procalcitonin (p&lt;0.0001).
32407459,ARDS was predicted by elevated LDH (p&lt;0.0001), while mortality was predicted by raised leukocyte count (p=0.0005) and elevated LDH (p&lt;0.0001).
32407459,Treatment with lopinavir-ritonavir showed no significant benefit in mortality and ARDS rates.
32407459,Corticosteroids were associated with a higher rate of ARDS (p=0.0003).
32407539,The scientific community has risen to the Covid-19 challenge, coming up with an impressive list of candidate drugs and vaccines targeting an array of pharmacological and immunological mechanisms.
32407539,Yet, generating clinical evidence of efficacy and safety of these candidate treatments may be frustrated by the absence of comprehensive trial coordination mechanisms.
32407539,Many small stand-alone trials and observational studies of single-agent interventions are currently running or in planning; many of these will likely not deliver robust results that could support regulatory and patient-level treatment decisions.
32407539,We here discuss actions that all stakeholders in the clinical trial ecosystem need to take to ensure that the window of opportunity during this pandemic will not shut, both for patients in need of treatment and for researchers to conduct decision-relevant clinical trials.
32407543,COVID-19 pandemic is an emerging new human disease, where no vaccines, or monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), or drugs are currently available for therapy.
32407543,Active vaccination requires the induction of an immune response against a given agent to a susceptible individual for the purpose of preventing or treating an infectious disease and this usually takes time to develop.
32407543,Thus, the use of existing autologous Ab administration, obtainable from recovered COVID 19 patients, after 2 weeks recovery, is the best and the most practical strategy for providing immediate passive immunity to susceptible recipients in need.
32407551,We read with interest the short paper describing, and commend the authors on sharing their experience the continued use of phototherapy in COVID-19 affected Italy.
32407551,Phototherapy is undoubtedly a long-established, relatively safe means of reducing the burden of inflammatory skin disease avoiding large doses of immunosuppression.
32407551,Home phototherapy devices and services have a long-established use in many countries throughout the world, as described in previous issues of this journal.
32407609,Neurological complications are increasingly recognized with SARS CoV-2, the causative pathogen for COVID-19.
32407609,We present a single-center retrospective case series reporting the EEG and outcome of de novo status epilepticus (SE) in two African-American women with laboratory-confirmed SARS CoV-2 virus.
32407609,SE was the initial presentation in one asymptomatic individual.
32407609,Patient 2 had COVID-19 pneumonia, and fluctuating mental status that raised the suspicion of subclinical SE.
32407609,The patient with older age and higher comorbidities failed to recover from the viral illness that has no definitive treatment.
32407719,To describe the clinical profiles and risk factors for critical illness in hospitalized children and adolescents with COVID-19.
32407719,Children 1 month to 21 years with COVID-19 from a single tertiary care children's hospital between March 15-April 13, 2020 were included.
32407719,Demographic and clinical data were collected. 67 children tested positive for COVID-19; 21 (31.3%) were managed as outpatients.
32407719,Of 46 admitted patients, 33 (72%) were admitted to the general pediatric medical unit and 13 (28%) to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU).
32407719,Obesity and asthma were highly prevalent but not significantly associated with PICU admission (p=0.99).
32407719,Admission to the PICU was significantly associated with higher C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, and pro-B type natriuretic peptide levels and platelet counts (p&lt;0.05 for all).
32407719,Patients in the PICU were more likely to require high-flow nasal cannula (p=0.0001) and were more likely to have received Remdesivir through compassionate release (p&lt;0.05).
32407719,Severe sepsis and septic shock syndromes were observed in 7 (53.8%) PICU patients.
32407719,Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was observed in 10 (77%) PICU patients, 6 of whom (46.2%) required invasive mechanical ventilation for a median of 9 days.
32407719,Of the 13 patients in the PICU, 8 (61.5%) were discharged home, and 4 (30.7%) patients remain hospitalized on ventilatory support at day 14.
32407719,One patient died after withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy because of metastatic cancer.
32407719,We describe a higher than previously recognized rate of severe disease requiring PICU admission in pediatric patients admitted to the hospital with COVID-19.
32407772,The COVID-19 pandemic and its sequelae have created scenarios of scarce medical resources, leading to the prospect that healthcare systems have faced or will face difficult decisions about triage, allocation and reallocation.
32407772,These decisions should be guided by ethical principles and values, should not be made before crisis standards have been declared by authorities, and, in most cases, will not be made by bedside clinicians.
32407772,Do not attempt resuscitation (DNAR) and withholding and withdrawing decisions should be made according to standard determination of medical appropriateness and futility, but there are unique considerations during a pandemic.
32407772,Transparent and clear communication is crucial, coupled with dedication to provide the best possible care to patients, including palliative care.
32407772,As medical knowledge about COVID-19 grows, more will be known about prognostic factors that can guide these difficult decisions.
32407808,Multiple gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms including diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, and abdominal pain, as well liver enzyme abnormalities have been variably reported in patients with COVID-19.
32407808,The AGA) Institute Clinical Guideline Committee and Clinical Practice Updates Committee performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of international data on GI and liver manifestations of COVID-19.
32407808,We performed a systematic literature search to identify published and unpublished studies using OVID Medline and pre-print servers (medRxiv, LitCovid, and SSRN) up until April 5 2020; major journal sites were monitored for US publications until April 19 2020.
32407808,We analyzed the prevalence of diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain as well as LFT abnormalities using a fixed effect model and assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE.
32407808,We identified 118 studies and used a hierarchal study selection process to identify unique cohorts.
32407808,We performed a meta-analysis of 47 studies including 10,890 unique patients.
32407808,Pooled prevalence estimates of GI symptoms was diarrhea 7.7% (95% CI 7.2-8.2), nausea/vomiting 7.8% (95% CI 7.1-8.5), abdominal pain 2.7% (95% CI 2.0-3.4).
32407808,Most studies reported on hospitalized patients.
32407808,The pooled prevalence of elevated liver abnormalities was: AST 15.0% (13.6 to 16.5) and ALT 15.0% (13.6 to 16.4).
32407808,When analyzed comparing data from China to studies from countries other than China, diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, liver abnormalities were more prevalent outside of China with diarrhea reported in 18.3% (16.6 to 20.1).
32407808,Isolated GI symptoms were rarely reported.
32407808,We also summarized of the Gl and liver adverse effects of the most commonly utilized medications for COVID19 CONCLUSIONS: GI symptoms are associated with COVID-19 in less than 10% of patients.
32407808,In studies outside of China, estimates are higher.
32407808,Further studies are needed with standardized GI symptoms questionnaires and LFT checks on admission to better quantify and qualify the association of these symptoms with COVID-19.
32407808,Based on findings from our meta-anlaysis, we make several Best Practice Statements for the consultative management of COVID-19.
32407884,There is no known effective therapy for patients with COVID-19.
32407884,Initial reports suggesting the potential benefit of Hydroxychloroquine/Azithromycin (HY/AZ) have resulted in massive adoption of this combination worldwide.
32407884,However, while the true efficacy of this regimen is unknown, initial reports have raised concerns regarding the potential risk of QT prolongation and induction of torsade de pointes (TdP). to assess the change in QTc interval and arrhythmic events in patients with COVID-19 treated with HY/AZ METHODS: This is a retrospective study of 251 patients from two centers, diagnosed with COVID-19 and treated with HY/AZ.
32407884,We reviewed ECG tracings from baseline and until 3 days after completion of therapy to determine the progression of QTc and incidence of arrhythmia and mortality.
32407884,QTc prolonged in parallel with increasing drug exposure and incompletely shortened after its completion.
32407884,Extreme new QTc prolongation to &gt; 500 ms, a known marker of high risk for TdP had developed in 23% of patients.
32407884,One patient developed polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) suspected as TdP, requiring emergent cardioversion.
32407884,Seven patients required premature termination of therapy.
32407884,The baseline QTc of patients exhibiting extreme QTc prolongation was normal.
32407884,The combination of HY/AZ significantly prolongs the QTc in patients with COVID-19.
32407884,This prolongation may be responsible for life threating arrhythmia in the form of TdP.
32407884,This risk mandates careful consideration of HY/AZ therapy in lights of its unproven efficacy.
32407884,Strict QTc monitoring should be performed if the regimen is given.
32407959,SARS-CoV-2 is causing an increasing number of deaths worldwide because no effective treatment is currently available.
32407959,Remdesivir has shown in vitro activity against coronaviruses and is a possible antiviral treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32407959,This prospective (compassionate), open-label study of remdesivir, which was conducted at Luigi Sacco Hospital, Milan, Italy, between February 23 and March 20, 2020, involved patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia aged ≥18 years undergoing mechanical ventilation or with an oxygen saturation level of ≤94 % in air or a National Early Warning Score 2 of ≥4.
32407959,The primary outcome was the change in clinical status based on a 7-category ordinal scale (1 = not hospitalised, resuming normal daily activities; 7 = deceased).
32407959,The 35 patients enrolled from February 23 to March 20, 2020, included 18 in intensive care unit (ICU), and 17 in our infectious diseases ward (IDW).
32407959,The 10-day course of remdesivir was completed by 22 patients (63 %) and discontinued by 13, of whom eight (22.8 %) discontinued because of adverse events.
32407959,The median follow-up was 39 days (IQR 25-44).
32407959,At day 28, 14 (82.3 %) patients from IDW were discharged, two were still hospitalized and one died (5.9 %), whereas in ICU 6 (33.3 %) were discharged, 8 (44.4 %) patients died, three (16.7 %) were still mechanically ventilated and one (5.6 %) was improved but still hospitalized.
32407959,Hypertransaminasemia and acute kidney injury were the most frequent severe adverse events observed (42.8 % and 22.8 % of the cases, respectively).
32407959,Our data suggest that remdesivir can benefit patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia hospitalised outside ICU where clinical outcome was better and adverse events are less frequently observed.
32407959,Ongoing randomised controlled trials will clarify its real efficacy and safety, who to treat, and when.
32408070,Currently, drug repurposing is an alternative to novel drug development for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.
32408070,The antimalarial drug chloroquine (CQ) and its metabolite hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) are currently being tested in several clinical studies as potential candidates to limit SARS-CoV-2-mediated morbidity and mortality.
32408070,CQ and HCQ (CQ/HCQ) inhibit pH-dependent steps of SARS-CoV-2 replication by increasing pH in intracellular vesicles and interfere with virus particle delivery into host cells.
32408070,Besides direct antiviral effects, CQ/HCQ specifically target extracellular zinc to intracellular lysosomes where it interferes with RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity and coronavirus replication.
32408070,As zinc deficiency frequently occurs in elderly patients and in those with cardiovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, or diabetes, we hypothesize that CQ/HCQ plus zinc supplementation may be more effective in reducing COVID-19 morbidity and mortality than CQ or HCQ in monotherapy.
32408070,Therefore, CQ/HCQ in combination with zinc should be considered as additional study arm for COVID-19 clinical trials.
32408155,Fingolimod is used for immune therapy in patients with multiple sclerosis.
32408155,Long-term treatment is associated with a small increase in the risk of herpes virus reactivation and respiratory tract infections.
32408155,Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) under Fingolimod treatment have not been described.
32408155,We report a 57-year old female patient with a relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis under fingolimod treatment who experienced a severe COVID-19 infection in March 2020 (Extended Disability Status Scale: 2.0).
32408155,Having peripheral lymphopenia typical for fingolimod treatment (total lymphocytes 0.39/nL [reference range 1.22-3.56]), the patient developed bilateral interstitial pneumonia with multiple ground-glass opacities on chest CT.
32408155,Fingolimod medication was stopped.
32408155,On the intensive care unit, non-invasive ventilation was used to provide oxygen and ventilation support regularly.
32408155,Over the following two days, oxygenation improved, and the patient was transferred to a normal ward five days after admission.
32408155,The implications fingolimod has on COVID-19 are complex.
32408155,As an S1P analogue, fingolimod might enhance lung endothelial cell integrity.
32408155,In addition, in case of a so-called cytokine storm, immunomodulation might be beneficial to reduce mortality.
32408155,Future studies are needed to explore the risks and therapeutic effects of fingolimod in COVID-19 patients.
32408156,Accumulating evidence shows that microbial co-infection increases the risk of disease severity in humans.
32408156,There have been few studies about SARS-CoV-2 co-infection with other pathogens.
32408156,In this retrospective study, 257 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients in Jiangsu Province were enrolled from January 22 to February 2, 2020.
32408156,They were re-confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and tested for 39 respiratory pathogens.
32408156,In total, 24 respiratory pathogens were found among the patients, and 242 (94.2 %) patients were co-infected with one or more pathogens.
32408156,Bacterial co-infections were dominant in all COVID-19 patients, Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae.
32408156,The highest and lowest rates of co-infections were found in patients aged 15-44 and below 15, respectively.
32408156,Most co-infections occurred within 1-4 days of onset of COVID-19 disease.
32408156,In addition, the proportion of viral co-infections, fungal co-infections and bacterial-fungal co-infections were the highest severe COVID-19 cases.
32408156,These results will provide a helpful reference for diagnosis and clinical treatment of COVID-19 patients.
32408336,A novel coronavirus was recently discovered and termed SARS-CoV-2.
32408336,Human infection can cause coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has been rapidly spreading around the globe<sup>1,2</sup>.
32408336,SARS-CoV-2 shows some similarities to other coronaviruses.
32408336,However, treatment options and a cellular understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection are lacking.
32408336,Here we identify the host cell pathways modulated by SARS-CoV-2 infection and show that inhibition of these pathways prevent viral replication in human cells.
32408336,We established a human cell culture model for infection with SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolate.
32408336,Employing this system, we determined the SARS-CoV-2 infection profile by translatome<sup>3</sup> and proteome proteomics at different times after infection.
32408336,These analyses revealed that SARS-CoV-2 reshapes central cellular pathways, such as translation, splicing, carbon metabolism and nucleic acid metabolism.
32408336,Small molecule inhibitors targeting these pathways prevented viral replication in cells.
32408336,Our results reveal the cellular infection profile of SARS-CoV-2 and led to the identification of drugs inhibiting viral replication.
32408336,We anticipate our results to guide efforts to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying host cell modulation upon SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32408336,Furthermore, our findings provide insight for the development of therapy options for COVID-19.
32408338,SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus with high nucleotide identity to SARS-CoV and SARS-related coronaviruses detected in horseshoe bats, has spread across the world and impacted global healthcare systems and economy<sup>1,2</sup>.
32408338,A suitable small animal model is needed to support vaccine and therapy development.
32408338,We report the pathogenesis and transmissibility of the SARS-CoV-2 in golden Syrian hamsters.
32408338,Immunohistochemistry demonstrated viral antigens in nasal mucosa, bronchial epithelial cells, and in areas of lung consolidation on days 2 and 5 post-inoculation (dpi), followed by rapid viral clearance and pneumocyte hyperplasia on 7 dpi.
32408338,Viral antigen was also found in the duodenum epithelial cells with viral RNA detected in feces.
32408338,Notably, SARS-CoV-2 transmitted efficiently from inoculated hamsters to naïve hamsters by direct contact and via aerosols.
32408338,Transmission via fomites in soiled cages was less efficient.
32408338,Although viral RNA was continuously detected in the nasal washes of inoculated hamsters for 14 days, the communicable period was short and correlated with the detection of infectious virus but not viral RNA.
32408338,Inoculated and naturally-infected hamsters showed apparent weight loss, and all animals recovered with the detection of neutralizing antibodies.
32408338,Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection in golden Syrian hamsters resemble features found in humans with mild infections.
32408391,Most severe manifestations of COVID-19 cases, such as multiple organ failure and death, have been linked to coagulation dysfunction markers, such as platelet reduction and increases in prothrombin time, fibrin degradation products and, mainly, D-dimer [1].
32408391,A recent paper by Tang et al. [2] in this journal reported that heparin treatment reduced mortality of COVID-19 patients with elevated D-dimer; similar preliminary results have been reported elsewhere [3].
32408391,A mounting body of evidence shows that SARS-CoV-2 causes a &quot;cytokine storm&quot; [1,4] that activates the coagulation cascade, leading to thrombosis.
32408391,Similar to the findings in severe sepsis, generalized deposition of intravascular thrombi compromises the blood supply of several organs, leading to organ failure [5].
32408508,COVID-19 is a worldwide emergency since it has rapidly spread from China to almost all the countries worldwide.
32408508,Italy has been one of the most affected countries after China.
32408508,North Italian regions, such as Lombardia and Veneto, had an abnormally large number of cases.
32408508,COVID-19 patients management requires availability of sufficiently large number of Intensive Care Units (ICUs) beds.
32408508,Resources shortening is a critical issue when the number of COVID-19 severe cases are higher than the available resources.
32408508,This is also the case at a regional scale.
32408508,We analysed Italian data at regional level with the aim to: (i) support health and government decision-makers in gathering rapid and efficient decisions on increasing health structures capacities (in terms of ICU slots) and (ii) define a geographic model to plan emergency and future COVID-19 patients management using reallocating them among health structures.
32408508,Finally, we retain that the here proposed model can be also used in other countries.
32408730,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious viral disease that is caused by the novel virus Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32408730,COVID-19 has become pandemic since December 2019, when the first case developed in Wuhan, China.
32408730,Patients receiving hemodialysis are more vulnerable to viral transmission because their immune functions are impaired and they receive treatment within a narrow space.
32408730,Calling on previous experience with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome during the 2015 outbreak, the joint committee of the Korean Society of Nephrology and the Korean Society of Dialysis Therapy quickly formed a COVID-19 task force team to develop a manual before the first index case was diagnosed in the hemodialysis unit.
32408730,This special article introduces clinical practice guidelines to prevent secondary transmission of COVID-19 within hemodialysis facilities, which were developed to protect patients, healthcare workers, and caregivers from this highly transmissible virus.
32408730,The areas of infection control covered by these guidelines include standard precautions, performing dialysis therapy for confirmed or suspected cases, performing cohort isolation for contact patients, and disease monitoring and contact surveillance.
32408730,We hope these guidelines help healthcare workers and hemodialysis patients around the world cope with the COVID-19 pandemic.
32408842,Response, action, and adaptation of the way health services are delivered will impact our ability to provide optimized and continuity of care while acting within resource constraints imposed by COVID-19.
32408842,Care for patients with cancer is particularly important given increased infection rates and worse outcomes from COVID-19 in this patient population, as well as potential adverse outcomes if treatment pathways need to be compromised.
32408842,In this commentary, we provide a global oncology pharmacy perspective (including both developed and developing nations) on how COVID-19 has impacted access to and delivery of cancer therapies.
32408842,This perspective was prepared by the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners, with input from national and regional oncology pharmacy practice groups (42 practice leaders from 28 countries and regions) who contributed to a snapshot survey between 10 and 22 April 2020.
32408842,Specifically, we highlight challenges related to safe handling of hazardous drugs and maintaining high-quality medication safety standards that have impacted various stakeholders.
32409150,Chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine (chloroquine) plus azithromycin is considered as therapy for COVID-19.
32409150,With benefit evaluations underway, safety concerns due to potential additive effects on QTc prolongation should be addressed.
32409150,We compared risk of cardiac adverse events between combinations of chloroquine and azithromycin and chloroquine and amoxicillin.
32409150,We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the IBM MarketScan Commercial Claims and Medicare Supplemental Databases, 2005-2018.
32409150,We included autoimmune disease patients aged ≥18 years initiating azithromycin or amoxicillin for ≥5 days during chloroquine treatment.
32409150,Patients had continuous insurance coverage ≥6 months before combination use until 5 days thereafter or inpatient death.
32409150,Two outcomes were sudden cardiac arrest/ventricular arrhythmias (SCA/VA) and cardiac symptoms.
32409150,We followed patients for up to 5 days to estimate hazard ratios (HR).
32409150,Covariates were adjusted using stabilized inverse probability treatment weighting.
32409150,We identified two SVC/VA events among &gt;145,000 combination users.
32409150,The adjusted incidence of cardiac symptoms among azithromycin and amoxicillin users was 276 vs 254 per 10,000 person-years with an adjusted HR of 1.10 (95%CI, 0.62-1.95).
32409150,Combination use of chloroquine and azithromycin at routine doses did not show pronounced increases in arrhythmias in this real-world population, though small sample size and outcome rates limit conclusions.
32409430,SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is transmitted through respiratory secretions and saliva.
32409430,The virus can also live for short periods of time (1 to several hours) on fomites such as doorknobs, handrails, and tables.
32409430,Aerosolization of the virus can occur during procedures including bronchoscopy, endotracheal intubation, and administration of nebulized treatments.
32409430,Asymptomatic shedding of the virus does occur and may account for up to 60% of cases.
32409430,Risk factors for a more severe course of COVID-19 include age 65 and older, living in a nursing home or long term care facility, chronic lung disease, and others.
32409434,Concerns have been raised about the potential for renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors to upregulate expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and thus increase susceptibility to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) entry.
32409434,Currently, there is no evidence that even if RAS inhibitors increase expression and activity of ACE2, that they would increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection by facilitating greater viral entry or worsen outcomes in patients with COVID-19.
32409434,At this time, there is no clinical evidence to suggest that treatment with RAS inhibitors should be discontinued in stable patients with COVID-19.
32409434,In hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19, decisions about these medications should be based on clinical condition, including hemodynamic status and renal function.
32409436,Analyses of COVID-19 patients with preexisting interstitial lung disease (ILD) or pulmonary sarcoidosis is lacking but registries are ongoing.
32409436,Treatment of COVID-19 for patients with underlying ILD or sarcoidosis may include hospital admission, possible drug treatment, caution with steroids, and avoidance of mechanical ventilation in acute exacerbation of ILD.
32409436,Patients with COVID-19 respiratory illness are at risk for developing ILD.
32409438,At present, there are no firm guidelines for the treatment of COVID-19-related emotional distress.
32409438,The current approach is based on our knowledge of how to manage anxiety in medically ill patients, taking into consideration all associated medical comorbidities, drug-drug interactions, and the patient's specific needs and preexisting mental illness.
32409438,Interventions should be implemented at the bedside to augment the patient's own resiliency in coping with these stressful events.
32409438,A targeted combination of psychopharmacology (targeting acute anxiety and panic symptoms) and psychotherapy (relaxation techniques, breathing exercises, and encouragement) is recommended.
32409439,Severe cases of COVID-19 are often attended by a syndrome that has been described as &quot;cytokine storm,&quot; with some features shared with macrophage activation syndrome.
32409439,A variety of experimental therapies targeting this hyperinflammatory state are now being applied in hospitals around the world.
32409439,Among the most widely used treatments are monoclonal antibodies targeting interleukin-6 (IL-6) or the IL-6 receptor.
32409439,Anti-IL-6 drugs are being widely used experimentally and as off-label therapy for patients with COVID-19 who are sick and deteriorating but have a reasonable chance of recovering, but they are still unproven and unapproved for this use.
32409439,The pandemic has created major ethical and practical questions about patient selection and nonapproved use vs use in the context of a randomized clinical trial.
32409440,COVID-19 infection is associated with several cardiac complications with high rates of adverse outcomes.
32409440,Cardiac imaging has different utility in different clinical scenarios, and the importance of minimizing healthcare worker exposure should be considered.
32409440,Cardiac imaging should only be ordered if its benefits outweigh its risks, with anticipated changes in acute treatment and outcomes, and no suitable alternative of sufficient adequacy is available.
32409440,Indications for advanced cardiac imaging for COVID-19 patients in the acute phase are limited, although follow-up imaging in the convalescent stage may provide prognostic importance in recovered COVID-19 patients with positive troponin or decompensated heart failure.
32409486,To assess the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine in patients admitted to hospital with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pneumonia who require oxygen.
32409486,Comparative observational study using data collected from routine care.
32409486,Four French tertiary care centres providing care to patients with covid-19 pneumonia between 12 March and 31 March 2020. 181 patients aged 18-80 years with documented severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia who required oxygen but not intensive care.
32409486,Hydroxychloroquine at a dose of 600 mg/day within 48 hours of admission to hospital (treatment group) versus standard care without hydroxychloroquine (control group).
32409486,The primary outcome was survival without transfer to the intensive care unit at day 21.
32409486,Secondary outcomes were overall survival, survival without acute respiratory distress syndrome, weaning from oxygen, and discharge from hospital to home or rehabilitation (all at day 21).
32409486,Analyses were adjusted for confounding factors by inverse probability of treatment weighting.
32409486,In the main analysis, 84 patients who received hydroxychloroquine within 48 hours of admission to hospital (treatment group) were compared with 89 patients who did not receive hydroxychloroquine (control group).
32409486,Eight additional patients received hydroxychloroquine more than 48 hours after admission.
32409486,In the weighted analyses, the survival rate without transfer to the intensive care unit at day 21 was 76% in the treatment group and 75% in the control group (weighted hazard ratio 0.9, 95% confidence interval 0.4 to 2.1).
32409486,Overall survival at day 21 was 89% in the treatment group and 91% in the control group (1.2, 0.4 to 3.3).
32409486,Survival without acute respiratory distress syndrome at day 21 was 69% in the treatment group compared with 74% in the control group (1.3, 0.7 to 2.6).
32409486,At day 21, 82% of patients in the treatment group had been weaned from oxygen compared with 76% in the control group (weighted risk ratio 1.1, 95% confidence interval 0.9 to 1.3).
32409486,Eight patients in the treatment group (10%) experienced electrocardiographic modifications that required discontinuation of treatment.
32409486,Hydroxychloroquine has received worldwide attention as a potential treatment for covid-19 because of positive results from small studies.
32409486,However, the results of this study do not support its use in patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 who require oxygen.
32409498,Diabetes is one of the most distinct comorbidities of COVID-19.
32409498,Here, we describe the clinical characteristics of and outcomes in patients with diabetes in whom COVID-19 has been confirmed or clinically diagnosed (with typical features on lung imaging and symptoms), and their association with glucose-lowering or blood pressure-lowering medications.
32409498,In this retrospective study involving 904 patients with COVID-19 (136 with diabetes, mostly type 2 diabetes), clinical and laboratory characteristics were collected and compared between the group with diabetes and the group without diabetes, and between groups taking different medications.
32409498,Logistic regression was used in order to explore risk factors associated with mortality or poor prognosis.
32409498,The proportion of comorbid diabetes is similar between cases of confirmed and of clinically diagnosed COVID-19.
32409498,Risk factors for higher mortality of patients with diabetes and COVID-19 were older age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.09 [95% CI 1.04, 1.15] per year increase; <i>P</i> = 0.001) and elevated C-reactive protein (aOR 1.12 [95% CI 1.00, 1.24]; <i>P</i> = 0.043).
32409498,Insulin usage (aOR 3.58 [95% CI 1.37, 9.35]; <i>P</i> = 0.009) was associated with poor prognosis.
32409498,Clinical outcomes of those who use an ACE inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin II type-I receptor blocker (ARB) were comparable with those of patients who do not use ACEI/ARB among patients with diabetes and hypertension who have COVID-19.
32409498,C-reactive protein may help to identify patients with diabetes who are at greater risk of dying during hospitalization.
32409498,Older patients with diabetes were prone to death related to COVID-19.
32409498,Attention needs to be paid to patients with diabetes and COVID-19 who use insulin.
32409498,ACEI/ARB use showed no significant impact on patients with diabetes and hypertension who have COVID-19.
32409502,Patients with obesity are at increased risk of exacerbations from viral respiratory infections.
32409502,However, the association of obesity with the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is unclear.
32409502,We examined this association using data from the only referral hospital in Shenzhen, China.
32409502,A total of 383 consecutively hospitalized patients with COVID-19 admitted from 11 January 2020 to 16 February 2020 and followed until 26 March 2020 at the Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen were included.
32409502,Underweight was defined as a BMI &lt;18.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, normal weight as 18.5-23.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, overweight as 24.0-27.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and obesity as ≥28 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.
32409502,Of the 383 patients, 53.1% were normal weight, 4.2% were underweight, 32.0% were overweight, and 10.7% were obese at admission.
32409502,Obese patients tended to have symptoms of cough (<i>P</i> = 0.03) and fever (<i>P</i> = 0.06) compared with patients who were not obese.
32409502,Compared with normal weight patients, those who were overweight had 1.84-fold odds of developing severe COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR] 1.84, 95% CI 0.99-3.43, <i>P</i> = 0.05), while those who were obese were at 3.40-fold odds of developing severe disease (OR 3.40, 95% CI 1.40-2.86, <i>P</i> = 0.007), after adjusting for age, sex, epidemiological characteristics, days from disease onset to hospitalization, presence of hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, liver disease and cancer, and drug used for treatment.
32409502,Additionally, after similar adjustment, men who were obese versus those who were normal weight were at increased odds of developing severe COVID-19 (OR 5.66, 95% CI 1.80-17.75, <i>P</i> = 0.003).
32409502,In this study, obese patients had increased odds of progressing to severe COVID-19.
32409502,As the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 may continue to spread worldwide, clinicians should pay close attention to obese patients, who should be carefully managed with prompt and aggressive treatment.
32409561,To assess the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine plus standard of care compared with standard of care alone in adults with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19).
32409561,Multicentre, open label, randomised controlled trial. 16 government designated covid-19 treatment centres in China, 11 to 29 February 2020. 150 patients admitted to hospital with laboratory confirmed covid-19 were included in the intention to treat analysis (75 patients assigned to hydroxychloroquine plus standard of care, 75 to standard of care alone).
32409561,Hydroxychloroquine administrated at a loading dose of 1200 mg daily for three days followed by a maintenance dose of 800 mg daily (total treatment duration: two or three weeks for patients with mild to moderate or severe disease, respectively).
32409561,Negative conversion of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 by 28 days, analysed according to the intention to treat principle.
32409561,Adverse events were analysed in the safety population in which hydroxychloroquine recipients were participants who received at least one dose of hydroxychloroquine and hydroxychloroquine non-recipients were those managed with standard of care alone.
32409561,Of 150 patients, 148 had mild to moderate disease and two had severe disease.
32409561,The mean duration from symptom onset to randomisation was 16.6 (SD 10.5; range 3-41) days.
32409561,A total of 109 (73%) patients (56 standard of care; 53 standard of care plus hydroxychloroquine) had negative conversion well before 28 days, and the remaining 41 (27%) patients (19 standard of care; 22 standard of care plus hydroxychloroquine) were censored as they did not reach negative conversion of virus.
32409561,The probability of negative conversion by 28 days in the standard of care plus hydroxychloroquine group was 85.4% (95% confidence interval 73.8% to 93.8%), similar to that in the standard of care group (81.3%, 71.2% to 89.6%).
32409561,The difference between groups was 4.1% (95% confidence interval -10.3% to 18.5%).
32409561,In the safety population, adverse events were recorded in 7/80 (9%) hydroxychloroquine non-recipients and in 21/70 (30%) hydroxychloroquine recipients.
32409561,The most common adverse event in the hydroxychloroquine recipients was diarrhoea, reported in 7/70 (10%) patients.
32409561,Two hydroxychloroquine recipients reported serious adverse events.
32409561,Administration of hydroxychloroquine did not result in a significantly higher probability of negative conversion than standard of care alone in patients admitted to hospital with mainly persistent mild to moderate covid-19.
32409561,Adverse events were higher in hydroxychloroquine recipients than in non-recipients.
32409561,ChiCTR2000029868.
32409832,December 2019 saw the emergence of a new epidemic of pneumonia of varying severity, called COVID-19, caused by a newly identified coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2.
32409832,No therapeutic option is available to treat this infection that has already killed more than 235,000 people worldwide.
32409832,This Viewpoint summarizes the strong scientific arguments supporting the use of alisporivir, a non-immunosuppressive analogue of cyclosporine A with potent cyclophilin inhibition properties that has reached Phase 3 clinical development, for the treatment of COVID-19.
32409832,They include the strong cyclophilin dependency of the lifecycle of many coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and preclinical data showing strong antiviral and cytoprotective properties of alisporivir in various models of coronavirus infection, including SARS-CoV-2.
32409832,Alisporivir should be tested without delay on both virological and clinical endpoints in patients with or at-risk of severe forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32410003,The world is facing Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which is causing a large number of deaths and burden on intensive care facilities.
32410003,It is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) originating in Wuhan, China.
32410003,It has been seen that fewer children contract COVID-19 and among infected, children have less severe disease.
32410003,Insights in pathophysiological mechanisms of less severity in children could be important for devising therapeutics for high-risk adults and elderly.
32410003,Early closing of schools and day-care centers led to less frequent exposure and hence, lower infection rate in children.
32410003,The expression of primary target receptor for SARS-CoV-2, i.e. angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2), decreases with age.
32410003,ACE-2 has lung protective effects by limiting angiotensin-2 mediated pulmonary capillary leak and inflammation.
32410003,Severe COVID-19 disease is associated with high and persistent viral loads in adults.
32410003,Children have strong innate immune response due to trained immunity (secondary to live-vaccines and frequent viral infections), leading to probably early control of infection at the site of entry.
32410003,Adult patients show suppressed adaptive immunity and dysfunctional over-active innate immune response in severe infections, which is not seen in children.
32410003,These could be related to immune-senescence in elderly.
32410003,Excellent regeneration capacity of pediatric alveolar epithelium may be contributing to early recovery from COVID-19.
32410003,Children, less frequently, have risk factors such as co-morbidities, smoking, and obesity.
32410003,But young infants and children with pre-existing illnesses could be high risk groups and need careful monitoring.
32410003,Studies describing immune-pathogenesis in COVID-19 are lacking in children and need urgent attention.
32410206,Background Clinical characteristics of patients with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may present differently within and outside the epicenter of Wuhan, China.
32410206,More clinical investigations are needed.
32410206,Objective The study was aimed to describe the clinical characteristics, laboratory parameters, and therapeutic methods of COVID-19 patients in Hunan, China.
32410206,Setting The First Hospital of Changsha, First People's Hospital of Huaihua, and the Central Hospital of Loudi, Hunan province, China.
32410206,Methods This was a retrospective multi-center case-series analysis.
32410206,Patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis hospitalized at the study centers from January 17 to February 10, 2020, were included.
32410206,The following data were obtained from electronic medical records: demographics, medical history, exposure history, underlying comorbidities, symptoms, signs, laboratory findings, computer tomography scans, and treatment measures.
32410206,Main outcome measure Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatments.
32410206,Results A total of 54 patients were included (51 had the common-type COVID-19, three had the severe-type), the median age was 41, and 52% of them were men.
32410206,The median time from the first symptoms to hospital admission was seven days.
32410206,Among patients with the common-type COVID-19, the median length of stay was nine days, and 21 days among patients with severe COVID-19.
32410206,The most common symptoms at the onset of illness were fever (74.5%), cough (56.9%), and fatigue (43.1%) among patients in the common-type group.
32410206,Fourteen patients (37.8%) had a reduced WBC count, 23 (62.2%) had reduced eosinophil ratio, and 21 (56.76%) had decreased eosinophil count.
32410206,The most common patterns on chest-computed tomography were ground-glass opacity (52.2%) and patchy bilateral shadowing (73.9%).
32410206,Pharmacotherapy included recombinant human interferon α2b, lopinavir/ritonavir, novaferon, antibiotics, systematic corticosteroids and traditional Chinese medicine prescription.
32410206,The outcome of treatment indicated that in patients with the common-type COVID-19, interferon-α2b, but not novaferon, had some benefits, antibiotics treatment was not needed, and corticosteroids should be used cautiously.
32410206,Conclusion As of February 10, 2020, the symptoms of COVID-19 patients in Hunan province were relatively mild comparing to patients in Wuhan, the epicenter.
32410206,We observed some treatment benefits with interferon-α2b and corticosteroid therapies but not with novaferon and antibiotic treatment in our study population.
32410234,Over the last months, pandemic SARS-CoV-2 caused a significant challenge for clinicians.
32410234,Unfortunately, no approved and validated treatments are available.
32410234,Intravenous tocilizumab, an antirheumatic drug, seems to be promising in counteracting cytokine storm caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection with associated clinical improvements.
32410234,We report herein a case series of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who were treated with tocilizumab administrated, for the first time, subcutaneously with good clinical and radiological outcomes.

32410245,Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32410245,The phenomenon of positive real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) result of SARS-CoV-2 in recovered patients had occurred and the research about these patients was rare.
32410245,In our study, we did a retrospective review of medical records from COVID-19 patients admitted to one ward of Tongji Hospital of Hua Zhong University of Science and Technology from 10 February to 13 April 2020.
32410245,From 10 February to 13 April 2020, there were 108 patients of COVID-19 admitted in the one ward of Tongji Hospital.
32410245,Among them, eight cases were readmission patients because the RT-PCR result of SARS-CoV-2 was positive again after discharge.
32410245,On the second admission, they had no symptoms and their chest CT was almost normal.
32410245,Data from laboratory tests of the re-admission patients showed that all eight patients had normal white blood cell count, lymphocyte count.
32410245,The inflammatory factors like procalcitonin and interleukin 6 were normal.
32410245,After treatment, two patients met the standard and were discharged.
32410245,The other six patients were still in the hospital because their RT-PCR of SARS-CoV-2 did not get three consecutive negative results and the course of two patients had persisted more than 90 days.
32410245,We still needed to be alert that these patients could infect other people as a source of infection, and we also needed to be alert that these patients become chronic virus carriers.
32410245,It also aroused our concern about the discharge standard of COVID-19.

32410319,The rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the virus, that causes Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) threatens global health.
32410319,Emerging evidence and past experience from other coronaviruses suggests that people with underlying liver disease including viral hepatitis could be at risk of disease severity and mortality.
32410319,However, with the present relatively low screening rates for the most prevalent viral hepatitis - Hepatitis B and C, many COVID-19 cases especially in low middle income countries are unlikely to be screened for viral hepatitis coinfection.
32410319,Without active screening, little will be known about the clinical and epidemiological manifestations which could negatively impact public health efforts.
32410319,In this commentary, we call for systematic and integrated screening of Hepatitis B and C for COVID-19 confirmed patients.
32410319,We also call for guidelines for management and treatment as well as research to understand the epidemiology of coinfection This article is protected by copyright.

32410413,To identify predictors of pulmonary fibrosis development by combining follow-up thin-section CT findings and clinical features in patients discharged after treatment for COVID-19.
32410413,This retrospective study involved 32 confirmed COVID-19 patients who were divided into two groups according to the evidence of fibrosis on their latest follow-up CT imaging.
32410413,Clinical data and CT imaging features of all the patients in different stages were collected and analyzed for comparison.
32410413,The latest follow-up CT imaging showed fibrosis in 14 patients (male, 12; female, 2) and no fibrosis in 18 patients (male, 10; female, 8).
32410413,Compared with the non-fibrosis group, the fibrosis group was older (median age: 54.0 years vs.
32410413,37.0 years, <i>p</i> = 0.008), and the median levels of C-reactive protein (53.4 mg/L vs.
32410413,10.0 mg/L, <i>p</i> = 0.002) and interleukin-6 (79.7 pg/L vs.
32410413,11.2 pg/L, <i>p</i> = 0.04) were also higher.
32410413,The fibrosis group had a longer-term of hospitalization (19.5 days vs.
32410413,10.0 days, <i>p</i> = 0.001), pulsed steroid therapy (11.0 days vs.
32410413,5.0 days, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and antiviral therapy (12.0 days vs.
32410413,6.5 days, <i>p</i> = 0.012).
32410413,More patients on the worst-state CT scan had an irregular interface (59.4% vs.
32410413,34.4%, <i>p</i> = 0.045) and a parenchymal band (71.9% vs.
32410413,28.1%, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001).
32410413,On initial CT imaging, the irregular interface (57.1%) and parenchymal band (50.0%) were more common in the fibrosis group.
32410413,On the worst-state CT imaging, interstitial thickening (78.6%), air bronchogram (57.1%), irregular interface (85.7%), coarse reticular pattern (28.6%), parenchymal band (92.9%), and pleural effusion (42.9%) were more common in the fibrosis group.
32410413,Fibrosis was more likely to develop in patients with severe clinical conditions, especially in patients with high inflammatory indicators.
32410413,Interstitial thickening, irregular interface, coarse reticular pattern, and parenchymal band manifested in the process of the disease may be predictors of pulmonary fibrosis.
32410413,Irregular interface and parenchymal band could predict the formation of pulmonary fibrosis early.
32410714,A COVID-19 outbreak started in Wuhan, China, last December and now has become a global pandemic.
32410714,The clinical information in caring of critically ill patients with COVID-19 needs to be shared timely, especially under the situations that there is still a largely ongoing spread of COVID-19 in many countries.
32410714,A multicenter prospective observational study investigated all the COVID-19 patients received in 19 ICUs of 16 hospitals in Wuhan, China, over 24 h between 8 AM February 2h and 8 AM February 27, 2020.
32410714,The demographic information, clinical characteristics, vital signs, complications, laboratory values, and clinical managements of the patients were studied.
32410714,A total of 226 patients were included.
32410714,Their median (interquartile range, IQR) age was 64 (57-70) years, and 139 (61.5%) patients were male.
32410714,The duration from the date of ICU admission to the study date was 11 (5-17) days, and the duration from onset of symptoms to the study date was 31 (24-36) days.
32410714,Among all the patients, 155 (68.6%) had at least one coexisting disease, and their sequential organ failure assessment score was 4 (2-8).
32410714,Organ function damages were found in most of the patients: ARDS in 161 (71.2%) patients, septic shock in 34 (15.0%) patients, acute kidney injury occurred in 57 (25.2%) patients, cardiac injury in 61 (27.0%) patients, and lymphocytopenia in 160 (70.8%) patients.
32410714,Of all the studied patients, 85 (37.6%) received invasive mechanical ventilation, including 14 (6.2%) treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) at the same time, 20 (8.8%) received noninvasive mechanical ventilation, and 24 (10.6%) received continuous renal replacement therapy.
32410714,By April 9, 2020, 87 (38.5%) patients were deceased and 15 (6.7%) were still in the hospital.
32410714,Critically ill patients with COVID-19 are associated with a higher risk of severe complications and need to receive an intensive level of treatments.
32410714,COVID-19 poses a great strain on critical care resources in hospitals.

32410747,The effectiveness of the non-pharmaceutical interventions implemented in Wuhan are described and discussed.
32410747,In the absence of vaccine and proven specific safe and effective treatments, the experience and results achieved by Wuhan could serve as a good reference for leaders and policymakers around the world in formulating their strategies and policies in fighting against COVID-19.
32410760,The Bergamo province, which is extensively affected by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic, is a natural observatory of virus manifestations in the general population.
32410760,In the past month we recorded an outbreak of Kawasaki disease; we aimed to evaluate incidence and features of patients with Kawasaki-like disease diagnosed during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
32410760,All patients diagnosed with a Kawasaki-like disease at our centre in the past 5 years were divided according to symptomatic presentation before (group 1) or after (group 2) the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
32410760,Kawasaki- like presentations were managed as Kawasaki disease according to the American Heart Association indications.
32410760,Kawasaki disease shock syndrome (KDSS) was defined by presence of circulatory dysfunction, and macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) by the Paediatric Rheumatology International Trials Organisation criteria.
32410760,Current or previous infection was sought by reverse-transcriptase quantitative PCR in nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs, and by serological qualitative test detecting SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG, respectively.
32410760,Group 1 comprised 19 patients (seven boys, 12 girls; aged 3·0 years [SD 2·5]) diagnosed between Jan 1, 2015, and Feb 17, 2020.
32410760,Group 2 included ten patients (seven boys, three girls; aged 7·5 years [SD 3·5]) diagnosed between Feb 18 and April 20, 2020; eight of ten were positive for IgG or IgM, or both.
32410760,The two groups differed in disease incidence (group 1 <i>vs</i> group 2, 0·3 <i>vs</i> ten per month), mean age (3·0 <i>vs</i> 7·5 years), cardiac involvement (two of 19 <i>vs</i> six of ten), KDSS (zero of 19 <i>vs</i> five of ten), MAS (zero of 19 <i>vs</i> five of ten), and need for adjunctive steroid treatment (three of 19 <i>vs</i> eight of ten; all p&lt;0·01).
32410760,In the past month we found a 30-fold increased incidence of Kawasaki-like disease.
32410760,Children diagnosed after the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic began showed evidence of immune response to the virus, were older, had a higher rate of cardiac involvement, and features of MAS.
32410760,The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic was associated with high incidence of a severe form of Kawasaki disease.
32410760,A similar outbreak of Kawasaki-like disease is expected in countries involved in the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
32410760,None.
32410772,Novel Corona-virus Disease 2019 (nCOVID 19) is caused by a novel virulent corona virus and leads to potentially fatal virulent pneumonia and severe respiratory distress syndrome.
32410772,It was initially declared as public health emergency if international concern by WHO followed by Pandemic on 12th March 2020.
32410772,As of 10th April 2020, more than 1.5 million people are affected globally with around 95,000 deaths.
32410772,Vaccines for this deadly virus are currently under development and many drugs used for other indications have been repurposed and investigated for prophylaxis and treatment of COVID 19.
32410772,As per SOLIDARITY trial by WHO, some of the most promising candidates include chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine which are anti-malarial medications, Remdesivir, Lopinavir-Ritonavir combination with or without interferon which are anti-HIV drugs and convalescent plasma therapy.
32410772,The current evidence of efficacy and ongoing research has been elaborated in the article.
32410772,Besides, there has been evidence regarding inflammatory pathogenesis of this virus leading to cytokine storm in susceptible individuals.
32410772,Thus, anti-proinflammatory cytokine drugs like Anakinra and Tocilizumab are undergoing multiple trials and some results are encouraging.
32410772,Similarly, use of anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-37 and IL-38 is hypothesised to be useful and is under research.
32410772,The situation is still evolving and hence there is yet no definitive therapy but to conclude the use of repurposed medications can be a boon till a definitive therapy and vaccines are developed.
32410896,COVID-19 is the disease caused by an infection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, first identified in the city of Wuhan, in China's Hubei province in December 2019.
32410896,COVID-19 was previously known as 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) respiratory disease before the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the official name as COVID-19 in February 2020.
32410896,The aim of this study is to search scientific literature in the biomedicine and analyzed current results of investigations regarding morbidity and mortality rates as consequences of COVID-19 infection of Cardiovascular diseases (CVD), and other most common chronic diseases which are on the top mortality and morbidity rates in almost all countries in the world.
32410896,Also, to propose most useful measures how to prevent patients to keep themselves against COVID-19 infection.
32410896,We used method of descriptive analysis of the published papers with described studies about Corona virus connected with CVD, and, also, Guidelines proposed by World Health Organization (WHO) and European Society of Cardiology (ESC), and some other international associations which are included in global fighting against COVID-19 infection.
32410896,After searching current scientific literature we have acknowledged that not any Evidence Based Medicine (EBM) study in the world during last 5 months from the time when first cases of COVID-10 infection was detected.
32410896,Also, there is no unique proposed ways of treatments and drugs to protect patients, especially people over 65 years old, who are very risk group to be affected with COVID-19.
32410896,Expectations that vaccine against COVID-19 will be produced optimal during at least 10 months to 2 years, and in all current Guidelines most important proposed preventive measures are the same like which one described in Strategic documents of WHO, in statements of Declaration of Primary Health Care in Alma Ata in 1978.
32410896,WHO proposed preventive measures can be helpful to everybody.
32410896,Physicians who work at every level of Health Care Systems, but especially at primary health care level, must follow those recommendations and teach their patients about it.
32410896,But, the fact is that current focus of COVID-19 epidemic has targeted on protection of physical health of population in global, however, the influence on mental health which will be one of the important consequences of COVID-19 pandemic in the future, and which could be declared as «Post-coronavirus Stress Syndrome&quot; (PCSS) could be bigger challenge for Global Public Health.
32410913,In January 2020, China reported a cluster of cases of pneumonia associated with a novel pathogenic coronavirus provisionally named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2).
32410913,Since then, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been reported in more than 180 countries with approximately 3 million known infections and more than 210,000 deaths attributed to this disease.
32410913,The majority of confirmed COVID-19 cases have been reported in adults, especially older individuals with co-morbidities.
32410913,Children have had a relatively lower rate and a less serious course of infection as reported in the literature to date.
32410913,One of the most vulnerable pediatric patient populations is cared for in the neonatal intensive care unit.
32410913,There is limited data on the effect of COVID-19 in fetal life, and among neonates after birth.
32410913,Therefore there is an urgent need for proactive preparation, and planning to combat COVID-19, as well as to safeguard patients, their families, and healthcare personnel.
32410913,This review article is based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) current recommendations for COVID-19 and its adaptation to our local resources.
32410913,The aim of this article is to provide basic consolidated guidance and checklists to clinicians in the neonatal intensive care units in key aspects of preparation needed to counter exposure or infection with COVID-19.
32410913,We anticipate that CDC will continue to update their guidelines regarding COVID-19 as the situation evolves, and we recommend monitoring CDC's updates for the most current information.
32411313,Dysregulation of inflammation is hypothesized to play a crucial role in the severe complications of COVID-19, with IL-1/IL-6 pathway being central.
32411313,Here, we report on the treatment of eight severe COVID-19 pneumonia patients-- seven hospitalized in intensive care units (ICUs) in Greece and one non-ICU patient in the Netherlands-- with the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist Anakinra.
32411313,All patients scored positive for the hemophagocytosis score (HScore) and were diagnosed with secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistocytosis (sHLH) characterized by pancytopenia, hyper-coagulation, acute kidney injury and hepatobiliary dysfunction.
32411313,At the end-of-treatment, ICU patients had less need for vasopressors, significantly improved respiratory function and lower HScore.
32411313,Although three patients died, the mortality was lower than historical series of patients with sHLH in sepsis.
32411313,These data suggest that administration of Anakinra may be beneficial for treating severe COVID-19 patients with sHLH as determined by the HScore and support the need for larger clinical studies to validate this concept.
32411315,The current COVID-19 pandemic has changed many medical practices in order to provide additional protection to both our patients and our healthcare providers.
32411315,In many cases this includes seeing patients through electronic means such as telehealth or telephone rather than seeing them in person.
32411315,Asthma exacerbations cannot always be treated in this way.
32411315,Current emergency unit asthma guidelines recommend bronchodilators be administered by metered dose inhaler (MDI) and spacer for mild-moderate asthma and include it as a choice even in severe asthma, but many emergency units continue to prefer nebulised therapy for patients who urgently require beta-agonists.
32411315,The utilization of nebulised therapy potentially increases the risk of aerosolization of the coronavirus.
32411315,Since nosocomial transmission of respiratory pathogens is a major threat in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, use of nebulised therapy is of even greater concern due to the potential increased risk of infection spread to nearby patients and health-care workers.
32411315,We propose a risk stratification plan that aims to avoid nebulised therapy, when possible, by providing an algorithm to help better delineate those who require nebulised therapy.
32411315,Protocols that include strategies to allow flexibility in using MDIs rather than nebulisers in all but the most severe patients should help mitigate this risk of aerosolised infection transmission to patients and health care providers.
32411315,Furthermore, expedient treatment of patients with high dose MDI therapy augmented with more rapid initiation of systemic therapy may help ensure patients are less likely to deteriorate to the stage where nebulisers are required.
32411566,Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCB) are typically used agents in the clinical management of hypertension.
32411566,Yet, they have also been utilized in the treatment of various pulmonary disorders with vasoconstriction.
32411566,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been implicated in the development of vasoconstrictive, proinflammatory, and pro-oxidative effects.
32411566,A retrospective review was conducted on CCB use in hospitalized patients in search of any difference in outcomes related to specific endpoints: survival to discharge and progression of disease leading to intubation and mechanical ventilation.
32411566,The electronic medical records for all patients that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 that were at or above the age of 65 and that expired or survived to discharge from a community hospital in Brooklyn, NY, between the start of the public health crisis due to the viral disease up until April 13, 2020, were included.
32411566,Of the 77 patients that were identified, 18 survived until discharge and 59 expired.
32411566,Seven patients from the expired group were excluded since they died within one day of presentation to the hospital.
32411566,Five patients were excluded from the expired group since their age was above that of the eldest patient in the survival group (89 years old).
32411566,With 65 patients left, 24 were found to have been administered either amlodipine or nifedipine (CCB group) and 41 were not (No-CCB group).
32411566,Patients treated with a CCB were significantly more likely to survive than those not treated with a CCB: 12 (50%) survived and 12 expired in the CCB group vs. six (14.6%) that survived and 35 (85.4%) that expired in the No-CCB treatment group (P&lt;.01; p=0.0036).
32411566,CCB patients were also significantly less likely to undergo intubation and mechanical ventilation.
32411566,Only one patient (4.2%) was intubated in the CCB group whereas 16 (39.0%) were intubated in the No-CCB treatment group (P&lt;.01; p=0.0026).
32411566,Nifedipine and amlodipine were found to be associated with significantly improved mortality and a decreased risk for intubation and mechanical ventilation in elderly patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
32411566,Further clinical studies are warranted.
32411566,Including either nifedipine or amlodipine in medication regimens for elderly patients with hypertension hospitalized for COVID-19 may be considered.
32411619,The availability of pathogen-specific treatment options for respiratory tract infections (RTIs) increased the need for rapid diagnostic tests.
32411619,Besides, retrospective studies, improved lab-based detection methods and the intensified search for new viruses since the beginning of the twenty-first century led to the discovery of several novel respiratory viruses.
32411619,Among them are human bocavirus (HBoV), human coronaviruses (HCoV-HKU1, -NL63), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), rhinovirus type C (RV-C), and human polyomaviruses (KIPyV, WUPyV).
32411619,Additionally, new viruses like SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV), novel strains of influenza virus A and B, and (most recently) SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have emerged.
32411619,Although clinical presentation may be similar among different viruses, associated symptoms may range from a mild cold to a severe respiratory illness, and thus require a fast and reliable diagnosis.
32411619,The increasing number of commercially available rapid point-of-care tests (POCTs) for respiratory viruses illustrates both the need for this kind of tests but also the problem, i.e., that the majority of such assays has significant limitations.
32411619,In this review, we summarize recently published characteristics of POCTs and discuss their implications for the treatment of RTIs.
32411619,The second key aspect of this work is a description of new and innovative diagnostic techniques, ranging from biosensors to novel portable and current lab-based nucleic acid amplification methods with the potential future use in point-of-care settings.
32411619,While prototypes for some methods already exist, other ideas are still experimental, but all of them give an outlook of what can be expected as the next generation of POCTs.
32411770,The number of patients with pneumonia stemming from the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection has increased rapidly.
32411770,However, the clinical characteristics of discharged patients remain little known.
32411770,Here, we attempt to describe the clinical characteristics and treatment experiences of discharged cases from Taizhou, China.
32411770,A total of 60 patients with COVID-19-infected pneumonia who were discharged from Taizhou Enze Medical Center (Group), from January 31, 2020, to February 16, 2020, were included in the analysis.
32411770,The discharge criteria were based on the New Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Program (Fifth Edition, China).
32411770,Of the 60 patients, the median age was 41 years, and 58.3% were male.
32411770,Only 13.3% of patients were identified as having severe novel coronavirus pneumonia.
32411770,All patients received combined antiviral treatment on admission, including β-interferon, lopinavir/tonavir, Abidol and oseltamivir.
32411770,All patients with severe conditions received gamma globulin and hormone therapy.
32411770,No patients had endotracheal intubation or died.
32411770,The median duration from symptom onset to hospitalization was 3 (range, 0-15) days.
32411770,The median duration of COVID-19 shedding was 14 (range, 5-26) days, and the median duration of hospital stay was 15 (range, 7-23) days.
32411770,Early therapy and comprehensive therapy are key to the outcome for patients with COVID-19-infected pneumonia, especially for those with severe pneumonia.
32411770,ChiCTR2000029866.
32412159,Immunocompromised patients may be at increased risk for complications of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.
32412159,However, comprehensive data of SARS-CoV-2 infection in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients are still lacking.
32412159,We performed a multicenter nationwide observational study within the Swiss Transplant Cohort Study (STCS) to describe the epidemiology, clinical presentation, treatment and outcomes of the first microbiologically documented SARS-CoV-2 infection among SOT recipients.
32412159,Overall, 21 patients were included with a median age of 56 years (10 kidney, 5 liver, 1 pancreas, 1 lung, 1 heart and 3 combined transplantations).
32412159,The most common presenting symptoms were fever (76%), dry cough (57%), nausea (33%) and diarrhea (33%).
32412159,Ninety-five percent and 24% of patients required hospital and ICU admission, respectively, and 19% were intubated.
32412159,After a median of 33 days of follow-up, 16 patients were discharged, 3 were still hospitalized and 2 patients died.
32412159,These data suggest that clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection in middle-aged SOT recipients appear to be similar to the general population without an apparent higher rate of complications.
32412159,These results need to be confirmed in larger cohorts.
32412310,During the ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the benefit of treating patients with cancer must be weighed against the COVID-19 infection risks to patients, staff and society.
32412310,Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers among men and raises particular interest during the pandemic as recent reports show that the TMPRSS2 (and other serine proteases), which facilitate the entry, replication and budding of the virion from a cell, can be inhibited using androgen deprivation therapy.
32412310,Nevertheless, patients with metastatic prostate cancer commonly receive chemotherapy which may compromise their immune system.
32412310,This paper aims to address the current status of the COVID-19 in patients with cancer overall and suggests an optimal approach to patients with metastatic prostate cancer.
32412509,The pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has hit health-care systems and societies in an unprecedented manner.
32412509,In 1981, the first cases of AIDS were reported and wide diagnostic testing helped to characterize high-risk groups and the global burden of the epidemic.
32412509,With Coronavirus Disease (COVID)-19, everything has happened too fast and both cases and fatalities are huge but still uncertain in most places.
32412509,Diagnostic testing of active and past SARS-CoV-2 infections needs to expand rapidly, ideally using rapid tests.
32412509,COVID-19 deaths are highly concentrated in the elderly population, with a large proportion of fatalities being &quot;with&quot; rather than &quot;by&quot; SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32412509,They are often the result of inadequate health care due to overwhelming demands.
32412509,To date, there is no specific therapy for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32412509,Several antivirals are being tested clinically, including remdesivir, at this time the most promising.
32412509,For others such as lopinavir/ritonavir, neither significant virological nor clinical benefit has been shown.
32412509,Given the characteristic pulmonary cytokine storm underlying the pathogenic mechanism of severe COVID-19 pneumonia and acute respiratory distress, antiinflammatory agents are being investigated.
32412509,The benefit of orticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine, etc., is limited.
32412509,Monoclonal antibodies targeting different pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tocilizumab, an anti-interleukin 6 agent, are being tried with encouraging results.
32412509,Ultimately a protective vaccine will be the best response for controlling the COVID-19 pandemic.
32412515,Except for pregnant women, the management of critically ill patients with COVID-19 during the pandemic includes the standard procedures that are used for any patient that requires to be attended to at the intensive care unit, as well as limited administration of crystalloid solutions, orotracheal intubation, invasive mechanical ventilation in the event of patient clinical deterioration, and muscle relaxants continuous infusion only if necessary.
32412515,Non-invasive mechanical ventilation and high-flow oxygen therapy are not recommended due to the generation of aerosol (associated with risk of viral spread among health personnel), and neither is extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or the use of steroids.
32412515,So far, there is no specific antiviral treatment for patients with COVID-19, and neither are there results of controlled trials supporting the use of any.
32412556,By April 7th, 2020, the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has infected one and a half million people worldwide, accounting for over 80 thousand of deaths in 209 countries and territories around the world.
32412556,The new and fast dynamics of the pandemic are challenging the health systems of different countries.
32412556,In the absence of vaccines or effective treatments, mitigation policies, such as social isolation and lock-down of cities, have been adopted, but the results vary among different countries.
32412556,Some countries were able to control the disease at the moment, as is the case of South Korea.
32412556,Others, like Italy, are now experiencing the peak of the pandemic.
32412556,Finally, countries with emerging economies and social issues, like Brazil, are in the initial phase of the pandemic.
32412556,In this work, we use mathematical models with time-dependent coefficients, techniques of inverse and forward uncertainty quantification, and sensitivity analysis to characterize essential aspects of the COVID-19 in the three countries mentioned above.
32412556,The model parameters estimated for South Korea revealed effective social distancing and isolation policies, border control, and a high number in the percentage of reported cases.
32412556,In contrast, underreporting of cases was estimated to be very high in Brazil and Italy.
32412556,In addition, the model estimated a poor isolation policy at the moment in Brazil, with a reduction of contact around 40%, whereas Italy and South Korea estimated numbers for contact reduction are at 75% and 90%, respectively.
32412556,This characterization of the COVID-19, in these different countries under different scenarios and phases of the pandemic, supports the importance of mitigation policies, such as social distancing.
32412556,In addition, it raises serious concerns for socially and economically fragile countries, where underreporting poses additional challenges to the management of the COVID-19 pandemic by significantly increasing the uncertainties regarding its dynamics.
32412693,Northern Italy has been one of the European regions reporting the highest number of COVID-19 cases and deaths.
32412693,The pandemic spread has challenged the National Health System, requiring reallocation of most of the available health care resources to treat COVID-19-positive patients, generating a competition with other health care needs, including cancer.
32412693,Patients with cancer are at higher risk of developing critical illness after COVID-19 infection.
32412693,Thus, mitigation strategies should be adopted to reduce the likelihood of infection in all patients with cancer.
32412693,At the same time, suboptimal care and treatments may result in worse cancer-related outcome.
32412693,In this article, we attempt to estimate the individual risk-benefit balance to define personalized strategies for optimal breast cancer management, avoiding as much as possible a general untailored approach.
32412693,We discuss and report the strategies our Breast Unit adopted from the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak to ensure the continuum of the best possible cancer care for our patients while mitigating the risk of infection, despite limited health care resources.
32412693,IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Managing patients with breast cancer during the COVID-19 outbreak is challenging.
32412693,The present work highlights the need to estimate the individual patient risk of infection, which depends on both epidemiological considerations and individual clinical characteristics.
32412693,The management of patients with breast cancer should be adapted and personalized according to the balance between COVID-19-related risk and the expected benefit of treatments.
32412693,This work also provides useful suggestions on the modality of patient triage, the conduct of clinical trials, the management of an oncologic team, and the approach to patients' and health workers' psychological distress.
32412811,This descriptive investigation was undertaken at three oncology units to report queries, needs, and fears related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (COVID-19) of patients with cancer and to avoid uncontrolled treatment delays or withdrawal, behavioral mistakes, and panic.
32412811,All queries spontaneously delivered through the WhatsApp instant messaging system commonly used by patients to communicate with oncology units were collected and grouped by homology in five categories.
32412811,Responses to the queries were given according to recommendations by the Italian Association of Medical Oncology through WhatsApp and by subsequent phone calls.
32412811,Patients were also classified according to the site of the primary tumor, stage of disease, and current treatments.
32412811,Analysis of the association between these data and queries was carried out.
32412811,The social scenario in Italy is a nationwide lockdown except for hospitals, pharmacies, and food supplies.
32412811,Overall, 446 different patients' WhatsApp conversations were analyzed between March 1 and March 13 and comprised the following: requirement of visit delay by patients undergoing oral therapies or in follow-up, delays in chemotherapy or immunotherapy administration, queries about possible immunosuppression, and changes in lifestyle or daily activities.
32412811,Delay requirements were statistically more frequent among patients with prostate or breast cancer compared with those with lung or pancreatic cancer.
32412811,Actions taken by oncologists are also reported.
32412811,To our knowledge, the WhatsApp instant messaging system has been occasionally used in other medical settings with controversial results.
32412811,In our experience, WhatsApp turned out to be adequate to give a rapid answer to most queries from patients with cancer in the COVID-19 pandemic scenario.
32412918,An outbreak of a novel, zoonotic coronavirus occurred in December 2019 in the city of Wuhan, China and has now affected almost the entire world, with the maximum confirmed cases being 1 521 252 as of April 10, 2020.
32412918,The WHO named this coronavirus 2019-nCoV, with COVID-19 being the name for diseases allied with it.
32412918,The study intended to examine the features and characteristics of existing human coronaviruses and identify their resemblance to the newly identified 2019-nCoV.
32412918,The research team performed a literature review, searching relevant literature databases.
32412918,We searched four databases, PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and CNKI (Chinese Database), to identify studies reporting COVID-19.
32412918,Articles published on or before April 10, 2020 were eligible for inclusion.
32412918,We used the following search terms: &quot;Coronavirus&quot; or &quot;2019-nCoV&quot; or &quot;COVID-19&quot; or &quot;SARS-CoV&quot; or &quot;MERS-CoV&quot; or &quot;Bat SARS-CoV&quot; or &quot;ACE2 receptor&quot;.
32412918,This study was take place in School of Pharmacy, Suresh Gyan Vihar University, Jaipur, India.
32412918,The undistinguishable similarity of the genomic sequences of Severe Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV, and Bat SARS-CoV-bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21-to nCoV-2019 has facilitated the process of identifying primary treatment measures.
32412918,Researchers are presuming the existence of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor binding in nCoV-2019, as in SARS-CoV.
32412918,Researchers have been examining human-to-human transmission, the possibility of an intermediate host between bats and humans, and the existence of asymptomatic cases.
32412918,An incubation period of 0 to 14 days has been reported, with acute to chronic symptoms being cough, nasal congestion, high fever, dyspnea, pneumonia, invasive lesions in both lungs, respiratory failure, and even death, including in pediatric cases.
32412918,Mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, repurposing of antivirals, and plasma infusion have proven to be somewhat effective.
32412918,Several countries have started clinical trials to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of some drugs, but the ability to vaccinate people with existing or new molecules will require time.
32412918,Previously learned lessons from SARS and MERS have led some areas to be well equipped in terms of the ability to take speedy action.
32412918,First-level treatments include repurposing antivirals and antimalarials, and plasma infusion should help, but development of existing or new molecules into vaccines will take time.
32412918,The unpredictable trajectory of this outbreak demands careful surveillance to monitor the situation, draw strategies, implement control measures, and create proper ethical laws and medical guidelines.
32412931,: The COVID-19 health crisis joined, rather than supplanted, the opioid crisis as the most acutely pressing threats to US public health.
32412931,In the setting of COVID-19, opioid use disorder treatment paradigms are being disrupted, including the fact that methadone clinics are scrambling to give &quot;take-home&quot; doses where they would typically not.
32412931,The rapid transition away from in-person examination, dosing and group therapy in an era of social isolation calls for adjustments to clinical practice, including emphasizing patient-provider communication, favoring new inductees on buprenorphine and leveraging technology to optimize safety of medication treatment.
32413276,The worldwide spread of COVID-19 highlights the need for an efficient approach to rapidly develop therapeutics and prophylactics against SARS-CoV-2.
32413276,The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, containing the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and S1 subunit involved in receptor engagement, is a potential therapeutic target.
32413276,We describe the development of a phage-displayed single-domain antibody library by grafting naive complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) into framework regions of a human germline immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (IGHV) allele.
32413276,Panning this library against SARS-CoV-2 RBD and S1 subunit identified fully human single-domain antibodies targeting five distinct epitopes on SARS-CoV-2 RBD with subnanomolar to low nanomolar affinities.
32413276,Some of these antibodies neutralize SARS-CoV-2 by targeting a cryptic epitope located in the spike trimeric interface.
32413276,Collectively, this work presents a versatile platform for rapid antibody isolation and identifies promising therapeutic anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies as well as the diverse immogneic profile of the spike protein.
32413300,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel respiratory illness caused by SARS-CoV-2.
32413300,Viral entry is mediated through viral spike protein and host ACE2 enzyme interaction.
32413300,Most cases are mild; severe disease often involves cytokine storm and organ failure.
32413300,Therapeutics including antivirals, immunomodulators, and vaccines are in development.

32413527,Italy experienced one of the world's deadliest COVID-19 outbreaks and healthcare systems had to instantly reorganise activity.
32413527,The Italian Radiation Oncology Departments adapted numerous solutions to minimize the disruptions.
32413527,Information technologies, treatment prioritization and implementation of hypofractionation and protection procedures allowed balancing between cancer patient care and patient/healthcare workers safety.
32413554,The COVID-19 pandemic has broadly disrupted biomedical treatment and research including non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS).
32413554,Moreover, the rapid onset of societal disruption and evolving regulatory restrictions may not have allowed for systematic planning of how clinical and research work may continue throughout the pandemic or be restarted as restrictions are abated.
32413554,The urgency to provide and develop NIBS as an intervention for diverse neurological and mental health indications, and as a catalyst of fundamental brain research, is not dampened by the parallel efforts to address the most life-threatening aspects of COVID-19; rather in many cases the need for NIBS is heightened including the potential to mitigate mental health consequences related to COVID-19.
32413554,To facilitate the re-establishment of access to NIBS clinical services and research operations during the current COVID-19 pandemic and possible future outbreaks, we develop and discuss a framework for balancing the importance of NIBS operations with safety considerations, while addressing the needs of all stakeholders.
32413554,We focus on Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) and low intensity transcranial Electrical Stimulation (tES) - including transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) and transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation (tACS).
32413554,The present consensus paper provides guidelines and good practices for managing and reopening NIBS clinics and laboratories through the immediate and ongoing stages of COVID-19.
32413554,The document reflects the analysis of experts with domain-relevant expertise spanning NIBS technology, clinical services, and basic and clinical research - with an international perspective.
32413554,We outline regulatory aspects, human resources, NIBS optimization, as well as accommodations for specific demographics.
32413554,A model based on three phases (early COVID-19 impact, current practices, and future preparation) with an 11-step checklist (spanning removing or streamlining in-person protocols, incorporating telemedicine, and addressing COVID-19-associated adverse events) is proposed.
32413554,Recommendations on implementing social distancing and sterilization of NIBS related equipment, specific considerations of COVID-19 positive populations including mental health comorbidities, as well as considerations regarding regulatory and human resource in the era of COVID-19 are outlined.
32413554,We discuss COVID-19 considerations specifically for clinical (sub-)populations including pediatric, stroke, addiction, and the elderly.
32413554,Numerous case-examples across the world are described.
32413554,There is an evident, and in cases urgent, need to maintain NIBS operations through the COVID-19 pandemic, including anticipating future pandemic waves and addressing effects of COVID-19 on brain and mind.
32413554,The proposed robust and structured strategy aims to address the current and anticipated future challenges while maintaining scientific rigor and managing risk.
32413608,The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has hit the European region disproportionately.
32413608,Many HIV clinics share staff and logistics with infectious disease facilities, which are now on the frontline in tackling COVID-19.
32413608,Therefore, this study investigated the impact of the current pandemic situation on HIV care and continuity of antiretroviral treatment (ART) supplies in CEE countries.
32413608,The Euroguidelines in Central and Eastern Europe (ECEE) Network Group was established in February 2016 to review standards of care for HIV in the region.
32413608,The group consists of professionals actively involved in HIV care.
32413608,On March 19, 2020 we decided to review the status of HIV care sustainability in the face of the emerging SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Europe.
32413608,For this purpose, we constructed an online survey consisting of 23 questions.
32413608,Respondents were recruited from ECEE members in 22 countries, based on their involvement in HIV care, and contacted via email.
32413608,In total, 19 countries responded: Albania, Armenia, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Georgia, Greece, Hungary, Lithuania, Macedonia, Poland, Republic of Moldova, Russia, Serbia, Turkey, and Ukraine.
32413608,Most of the respondents were infectious disease physicians directly involved in HIV care (17/19).
32413608,No country reported HIV clinic closures.
32413608,HIV clinics were operating normally in only six countries (31.6%).
32413608,In 11 countries (57.9%) physicians were sharing HIV and COVID-19 care duties.
32413608,None of the countries expected shortage of ART in the following 2 weeks; however, five physicians expressed uncertainty about the following 2 months.
32413608,At the time of providing responses, ten countries (52.6%) had HIV-positive persons under quarantine.
32413608,A shortage of resources is evident, with an impact on HIV care inevitable.
32413608,We need to prepare to operate with minimal medical resources, with the aim of securing constant supplies of ART.
32413608,Non-governmental organizations should re-evaluate their earlier objectives and support efforts to ensure continuity of ART delivery.
32413619,Coronavirus pneumonia is accompanied by rapid virus replication, where a large number of inflammatory cell infiltration and cytokine storm may lead to acute lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and death.
32413619,The uncontrolled release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6, is associated with ARDS.
32413619,This constituted the first study to report on the variability in physicochemical properties of β-glucans extracts from the same edible mushroom Lentinus edodes on the reduction of these pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress.
32413619,Specifically, the impact on the immunomodulatory and cytoprotective properties of our novel in 'house' (IH-Lentinan, IHL) and a commercial (Carbosynth-Lentinan, CL) Lentinan extract were investigated using in vitro models of lung injury and macrophage phagocytosis.
32413619,CL comprised higher amounts of α-glucans and correspondingly less β-glucans.
32413619,The two lentinan extracts demonstrated varying immunomodulatory activities.
32413619,Both Lentinan extracts reduced cytokine-induced NF-κB activation in human alveolar epithelial A549 cells, with the IHL extract proving more effective at lower doses.
32413619,In contrast, in activated THP-1 derived macrophages, the CL extract more effectively attenuated pro-inflammatory cytokine production (TNF-α, IL-8, IL-2, IL-6, IL-22) as well as TGF-β and IL-10.
32413619,The CL extract attenuated oxidative stress-induced early apoptosis, while the IHL extract attenuated late apoptosis.
32413619,Our findings demonstrate significant physicochemical differences between Lentinan extracts, which produce differential in vitro immunomodulatory and pulmonary cytoprotective effects that may also have positive relevance to candidate COVID-19 therapeutics targeting cytokine storm.
32413736,The novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV2, can cause a potentially fatal disease, COVID-19, in humans.
32413736,Here, we will provide an overview of therapeutic options for COVID-19.
32413736,Plasma from patients recovered from COVID-19 that contains antibodies against SARS-CoV2 has shown promising results in patients with severe COVID-19.
32413736,Also, IVIG, combined with moderate-dose of corticosteroids, might improve patient outcomes.
32413736,Evidence links COVID-19 to variable degrees of inflammation.
32413736,Studies show that the use of corticosteroids might accelerate recovery from COVID-19.
32413736,There are, however, no controlled clinical trials that show whether the use of corticosteroids can reduce COVID-19-related death.
32413736,Also, the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL6 is the best-documented cytokine in COVID-19 correlated with severity, criticality, viral load, and prognosis of patients with COVID-19.
32413736,Tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody against IL6, could confer clinical benefit in patients with high IL6 levels.
32413736,Essential elements that process SARS-CoV2 cell entry and specific characteristics that allow SARS-CoV2 to escape the immune system have the potential as targets for COVID-19 therapy.
32414384,The most terrifying thing about pandemic could be the large number of patients running against the health service system, which causes a serious shortage of health resources, especially medical personnel.
32414384,Plotting mortality and diagnosis rates against medical staff resources in 16 cities in Hubei Province, where the epidemic was initially concerned and the most severe, shows a significant negative correlation, indicating the critical role of medical staff resources in controlling epidemics.
32414384,Nevertheless, it is difficult to ensure that there exist enough medical personnel in cities severely hit by the outbreak.
32414384,China provides solutions by adopting nationwide &quot;pairing assistance&quot; measures with at least one province assisting one city to alleviate pressure in the most severe area.
32414384,By plotting the number of patients receiving treatment against day, it is clear that implementing &quot;pairing assistance&quot; is a turning point in China's fight against epidemics.
32414390,A novel coronavirus pneumonia outbreak began in Wuhan, Hubei Province, in December 2019; the outbreak was caused by a novel coronavirus previously never observed in humans.
32414390,China has imposed the strictest quarantine and closed management measures in history to control the spread of the disease.
32414390,However, a high level of evidence to support the surgical management of potential trauma patients during the novel coronavirus outbreak is still lacking.
32414390,To regulate the emergency treatment of trauma patients during the outbreak, we drafted this paper from a trauma surgeon perspective according to practical experience in Wuhan.
32414390,The article illustrates the general principles for the triage and evaluation of trauma patients during the outbreak of COVID-19, indications for emergency surgery, and infection prevention and control for medical personnel, providing a practical algorithm for trauma care providers during the outbreak period.
32414390,The measures of emergency trauma care that we have provided can protect the medical personnel involved in emergency care and ensure the timeliness of effective interventions during the outbreak of COVID-19.
32414626,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is leading to delays in the treatment of many urologic cancers.
32414626,To provide a contemporary picture of the risks from delayed treatment for urologic cancers to assist with triage.
32414626,A collaborative review using literature published as of April 2, 2020.
32414626,Patients with low-grade non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer are unlikely to suffer from a 3-6-month delay.
32414626,Patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer are at risk of disease progression, with radical cystectomy delays beyond 12 wk from diagnosis or completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
32414626,Prioritization of these patients for surgery or management with radiochemotherapy is encouraged.
32414626,Active surveillance should be used for low-risk prostate cancer (PCa).
32414626,Treatment of most patients with intermediate- and high-risk PCa can be deferred 3-6 mo without change in outcomes.
32414626,The same may be true for cancers with the highest risk of progression.
32414626,With radiotherapy, neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the standard of care.
32414626,For surgery, although the added value of neoadjuvant ADT is questionable, it may be considered if a patient is interested in such an approach.
32414626,Intervention may be safely deferred for T1/T2 renal masses, while locally advanced renal tumors (≥T3) should be treated expeditiously.
32414626,Patients with metastatic renal cancer may consider vascular endothelial growth factor targeted therapy over immunotherapy.
32414626,Risks for delay in the treatment of upper tract urothelial cancer depend on grade and stage.
32414626,For patients with high-grade disease, delays of 12 wk in nephroureterectomy are not associated with adverse survival outcomes.
32414626,Expert guidance recommends expedient local treatment of testis cancer.
32414626,In penile cancer, adverse outcomes have been observed with delays of ≥3 mo before inguinal lymphadenectomy.
32414626,Limitations include a paucity of data and methodologic variations for many cancers.
32414626,Patients and clinicians should consider the oncologic risk of delayed cancer intervention versus the risks of COVID-19 to the patient, treating health care professionals, and the health care system.
32414626,The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has led to delays in the treatment of patients with urologic malignancies.
32414626,Based on a review of the literature, patients with high-grade urothelial carcinoma, advanced kidney cancer, testicular cancer, and penile cancer should be prioritized for treatment during these challenging times.
32414708,Approximately 12% to 15% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection require invasive ventilation via endotracheal intubation.
32414708,The key to minimizing risk of disease transmission during this aerosol-generating procedure is careful preparation, which includes having necessary equipment and medications on hand as well as an experienced intubation team who can troubleshoot any unforeseen complications.
32414708,Personal protective equipment should be donned and doffed in the presence of an assistant (ie, &quot;buddy&quot; system).
32414711,COVID-19, caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2, is a disease characterised by cough, fever and fatigue, which progresses to life-threatening lung injury in approximately 5% of patients.
32414711,The SARS-CoV-2 virus enters the cell via ACE2.
32414711,ACE2 is a component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) which has an important counterregulatory effect on the classical ACE-dependent pathway.
32414711,Several antihypertensives increase ACE2 expression or activity, leading to concern that this may facilitate SARS-CoV-2 entry and worsen COVID-19 disease.
32414711,However, ACE2 is protective against lung injury while ANG II (which is catabolised by ACE2) is associated with lung injury both in mice and humans.
32414711,We propose that medications which inhibit the RAS ACE-dependent pathway may be beneficial in treating COVID-19 and should be explored in animal models and clinical trials.
32414711,Here we give an overview of the RAS pathway with respect to COVID-19 and argue that strategies which manipulate this pathway might reduce the destructive lung manifestations of COVID-19 and improve patient outcomes.
32414757,Vaccines are a powerful measure to protect the health of individuals and to combat outbreaks such as the COVID-19 pandemic.
32414757,An ethical dilemma arises when one effective vaccine has been successfully developed against an epidemic disease and researchers seek to test the efficacy of another vaccine for the same pathogen in clinical trials involving human subjects.
32414757,On the one hand, there are compelling reasons why it would be unethical to trial a novel vaccine when an effective product exists already.
32414757,First, it is a firm principle of medical ethics that an effective treatment or vaccine should not be withheld from patients if their life may depend on it.
32414757,Second, since epidemic outbreaks often emerge in settings with less-resourced health systems, there is a pronounced risk that any trial withholding an effective vaccine would disproportionately affect the vulnerable populations that historically have been exploited for biomedical research.
32414757,Third, clinical trials for novel vaccines may be at odds with efforts to control active outbreaks.
32414757,On the other hand, it may be justified to conduct a trial for a candidate vaccine if it is expected to have certain advantages compared with the existing product.
32414757,This essay discusses key factors for comparing vaccines against epidemic pathogens, including immunological, logistical and economic considerations.
32414757,Alongside a case study of the development of vaccines for Ebola, the essay seeks to establish a general framework that should be expanded and populated by immunologists, epidemiologists, economists and bioethicists, and ultimately could be applied to the case of COVID-19 vaccines.
32414996,The COVID-19 infection outbreak has aroused increasing attention and affected thousands of people nationwide.
32414996,The long incubation period, high infectious rate, varied manifestation, and absence of effective treatment make it difficult to manage the disease transmission.
32414996,The intended goals are to encourage efficient management of neurological and neurosurgical patients, resource utilization, and protecting the healthcare provider during the COVID-19 epidemic.
32414996,Herein, we present a consensus statement from various centers in India.
32414996,In addition to the literature review, recommendations were included from neurologists and neurosurgeons from various centers in India.
32414996,Every patient presenting for treatment should be treated as a potential asymptomatic infected case.
32414996,Patients should be categorized based upon the priority as acute (require immediate treatment/surgery within 24 h), sub-acute (requiring treatment within a maximum of 7-10 days), or chronic (requiring treatment within a month).
32414996,Non-essential elective surgeries and outpatient clinics should be avoided after informing the patient(s).
32414996,There is a high risk of aerosol dispersion during intubation and certain neurosurgical procedures particularly those involving drills and endoscopes.
32414996,These procedures should be performed wearing full personal protective equipment.
32414996,The workflow of the operating rooms should also be modified significantly.
32414996,Minor modifications in personal and professional lifestyles and routine training to use the PPE will ensure efficient management of resources.
32414996,These recommendations could be used to mitigate the risks and reduce exposure to other patients, public, and healthcare staff.
32415305,The outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.
32415305,As of 21 March 2020, this epidemic has spread to 179 countries with more than 200 000 confirmed cases and 8578 deaths.
32415305,The outbreak has put enormous pressure on the medical establishment and even led to exhaustion of medical resources in the most affected areas.
32415305,Other medical work has been significantly affected in the context of COVID-19 epidemic.
32415305,In order to reduce or avoid cross-infection with COVID-19, many hospitals have taken measures to limit the number of outpatient visits and inpatients.
32415305,For example, emergency surgery can only be guaranteed, and most other surgeries can be postponed.
32415305,Patients with cancer are one of the groups most affected by the epidemic because of their systematic immunosuppressive state and requirement of frequent admission to hospital.
32415305,Consequently, specific adjustments for their treatment need to be made to cope with this situation.
32415305,Therefore, it is of significance to summarize the relevant experience of China in the prevention and control of COVID-19 infection and treatment of patients with cancer during the epidemic.
32415341,Public discussion and health-care systems worldwide have been focusing on the COVID-19 pandemic.
32415341,Does it have an impact on cancer care today?
32415341,The PRIO (&quot;Prevention and Integrative Oncology&quot;) Working Group (German Cancer Society) has initiated an online survey for physicians, medical staff and patients on April 16, 2020.
32415341,Between April 16 and April 19, 47 doctors and 146 patients filled in the questionnaires.
32415341,The survey is ongoing.
32415341,We present the first data.
32415341,A majority of German patients (76%) and physicians (71%) report moderate or high restriction in their daily life.
32415341,A minority (patients 25%, physicians 13%) was not worried that necessary treatments or diagnostics were restricted.
32415341,Organizing cancer care needs more time and efforts for 56% of all reporting doctors. 98% of all oncologists think that restriction of family visits has a negative impact on the mental health of cancer patients.
32415341,Half of all participants (patients 43%, physicians 47%) expect negative consequences on the physical status of our patients.
32415341,Patients feel the existing emotional stress in 34% of their physicians. 52% of physicians fear mental and/or physical longtime consequences for themselves.
32415341,There is a high level of mental and physical stress triggered by the present COVID-19 management.
32415341,After only a few weeks, human resources are limited.
32415341,They will be the most important key for further health-care services for patients with cancer and other chronic diseases.
32415348,The COVID-19 infection is an aggressive viral illness with high risk of transmission during otolaryngology examination and surgery.
32415348,Cholesteatoma is known for its potential to cause complications and scheduling of surgery during the pandemic must be done carefully.
32415348,The majority of otological surgeries may be classified as elective and postponed at this time (e.g., stapedotomy, tympanoplasty); whereas, others are emergencies (e.g., complicated acute otitis media, complicated cholesteatoma with cerebral or Bezold's abscess, meningitis, sinus thrombosis) and require immediate intervention.
32415348,What is the ideal time for the surgical management of Cholesteatoma during the COVID-19 pandemic?
32415348,Senior otologic surgeons from six teaching hospitals from various countries affected by the COVID-19 from around the world met remotely to make recommendations on reorganizing schedules for the treatment of cholesteatoma which has a risk of severe morbidity and mortality.
32415348,The recommendations are based on their experiences and on available literature.
32415348,Due to the high risk of infecting the surgical staff it is prudent to stop all elective ear surgeries and plan cholesteatoma surgery after careful selection of patients, based on the extent of the disease and available resources.
32415348,Specific precautions including use of appropriate personal protection equipment should be followed when operating on all patients during the pandemic.
32415348,To facilitate the decision-making in the management of cholesteatoma, timing for surgery can be divided into two categories with 3 and 2 sub-groups based on disease severity.
32415348,Evidence on the timing of surgery of patients with cholesteatoma during the COVID-19 pandemic is lacking.
32415348,This manuscript contains practical tips on how cholesteatoma surgery can be reorganized during this pandemic.
32415419,Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is an old medication for malaria.
32415419,In addition to handling this parasitic disease, HCQ is also used to treat a number of autoimmune disorders including rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus when other medications are not effective.
32415419,Recently a new viral infection (COVID-19) is rocking the entire world so much that it has already taken more than 200,000 lives throughout the world within the last two months and the World Health Organization was forced to declare it as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
32415419,Interestingly, some reports indicate that this wonder drug may be also beneficial for COVID-19 and accordingly, many clinical trials have begun.
32415419,Here, we discuss different modes of action (anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, inhibition of endosomal acidification, suppression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 or ACE2 glycosylation, etc.) of HCQ that might be responsible for its possible anti-COVID-19 effect.
32415419,On the other hand, this review also makes an honest attempt to delineate mechanisms (increase in vasoconstriction, inhibition of autophagy, depletion of T cells, etc.) indicating how it may aggravate certain conditions and why caution should be taken before granting widespread repurposing of HCQ for COVID-19.
32415419,Graphical Abstract.
32415426,Growing concerns about anxiety associated with COVID-19 have led to recommendations for effective self-care, and greater availability of mental health treatment.
32415426,At the same time, existential concerns raised by the pandemic suggest the importance of religious resources, as seen in research into the experience of patients dealing with advanced cancer.
32415472,To evaluate stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in low-risk Prostate Cancer patients as preferred treatment option in emergency health conditions.
32415472,From April 2013 to September 2015, 28 patients with low-risk prostate cancer were prospectively enrolled.
32415472,The SBRT prescribed dose was 36.25 Gy in 5 fractions, twice a week.
32415472,Primary endpoints were acute and late toxicity.
32415472,Secondary endpoints were biochemical recurrence free survival (bRFS) and overall survival.
32415472,Median follow-up was 65.5 months (range 52-81).
32415472,No acute G3 or G4 toxicity was recorded.
32415472,Acute G1 or G2 genitourinary (GU) toxicity occurred in 43% and acute G1-G2 gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity in 14%.
32415472,Late G1 and G3 GU toxicity in 18% and 3.5%, respectively.
32415472,The G3 toxicity was not directly attributable to radiotherapy.
32415472,Late G1 GI toxicity occurred in 18%. 5yy bRFS was 96.5% (95% CI 82.3-99.4%).
32415472,Stereotactic body radiotherapy for early prostate cancer reported safe toxicity profile and a good clinical outcome at the median follow-up of 5 years.
32415472,It may be an useful option if radiotherapy is required in emergency medical conditions.
32415473,SARS-CoV-2 pandemic represents a troubling health emergency but also a main challenge for the clinical governance of the system.
32415473,Discontinuation of radiation treatments is not desirable and potentially life-threatening.
32415473,On the other hand, accesses to hospital expose cancer patients to an increased risk of COVID-19 infection.
32415473,We report our extended protocol, draft to manage clinical activities in our radiotherapy department, by minimizing contagion risks.
32415473,We used telephonic screening to assess the need for patient admission.
32415473,A telephonic triage was performed to identify the presence of COVID-19 infection risk factors or symptoms.
32415473,New treatments were stratified according to priority codes.
32415473,A reserved entrance to radiotherapy department was assured for patients and staff.
32415473,Surgical disposable mask was required for patients and caregivers.
32415473,The activities were distributed during the whole workday, avoiding overlap to reduce aggregation.
32415473,From 1st February 2020 to 31 March 2020, we reported an increase in the number of first medical examinations and treatments, compared to the same period of the previous year.
32415473,Outpatients first medical examinations have been spread over the 12 working hours.
32415473,No COVID-19 cases were detected.
32415473,During COVID-19 pandemic, we introduced procedures that allowed us to ensure the continuity in oncological cares, with limited risks of infection for patients and staff.
32415494,Scientists hypothesized that drugs such as ibuprofen or renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers could exacerbate the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 by upregulating the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which serves as an entry receptor for the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
32415494,This hypothesis was taken up by the lay press and led to concerns among doctors and patients whether the use of these drugs was still safe and justified against the background of the pandemic spread of SARS-CoV-2 with an increasing number of cases and deaths.
32415494,In this article, we summarize what is known about the effect of RAS blockers or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on the course of COVID-19 disease.
32415494,In the case of RAS inhibition, we also find evidence for the opposite hypothesis, namely, that RAS inhibition in COVID-19 could be protective.
32415494,In view of the inconsistent and limited evidence and after weighing up the benefits and risks, we would not currently recommend discontinuing or switching an effective treatment with RAS blockers.
32415494,NSAIDs should be used at the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible period.
32415494,The choice of drug to treat COVID-19-associated fever or pain should be based on a benefit-risk assessment for known side effects (e.g., kidney damage, gastrointestinal ulceration).
32415658,The extraordinary spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has dramatically and rapidly changed the way in which we provide medical care for patients with all diagnoses.
32415658,Conservation of resources, social distancing, and the risk of poor outcomes in COVID-19-positive cancer patients have forced practitioners and surgeons to completely rethink routine care.
32415658,The treatment of patients with rectal cancer requires both a multidisciplinary approach and a significant amount of resources.
32415658,It is therefore imperative to rethink how rectal cancer treatment can be aligned with the current COVID-19 pandemic paradigms.
32415658,In this review, we discuss evidence-based recommendations to optimize oncological outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32415690,Resurgence in the use of chloroquine as a putative treatment for COVID-19 has seen recent cases of fatal toxicity due to unintentional overdoses.
32415690,Protocols for the management of poisoning recommend diazepam, although there are uncertainties in its pharmacology and efficacy in this context.
32415690,The aim was to assess the effects of diazepam in experimental models of chloroquine cardiotoxicity.
32415690,In vitro experiments involved cardiac tissues isolated from rats and incubated with chloroquine, alone, or in combination with diazepam.
32415690,In vivo models of toxicity involved chloroquine administered intravenously to pentobarbitone-anaesthetised rats and rabbits.
32415690,Randomised, controlled interventional studies in rats assessed diazepam, clonazepam and Ro5-4864 administered: (i) prior, (ii) during, and (iii) after chloroquine; and the effects of diazepam: (iv) at high dose, (v) in urethane-anaesthetised rats, and (vi) co-administered with adrenaline.
32415690,Chloroquine decreased the developed tension of left atria, prolonged the effective refractory period of atria, ventricular tissue and right papillary muscles, and caused dose-dependent impairment of haemodynamic and electrocardiographic parameters.
32415690,Cardiac arrhythmias indicated impairment of atrioventricular conduction.
32415690,Studies (i), (ii) and (v) showed no differences between interventions and control.
32415690,Diazepam increased heart rate in study (iv) and, as with clonazepam, also prolonged the QTc interval in study (iii).
32415690,Combined administration of diazepam and adrenaline in study (vi) improved cardiac contractility but caused hypokalaemia.
32415690,Neither diazepam, nor other ligands for benzodiazepine binding sites, protect against or attenuate chloroquine cardiotoxicity.
32415690,However, diazepam may augment the effe cts of positive inotropes in reducing chloroquine cardiotoxicity.
32415723,The COVID-19 pandemic poses a unique challenge to the care of patients with haematological malignancies.
32415723,Viral pneumonia is known to cause disproportionately severe disease in patients with cancer, and patients with lymphoma, myeloma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia are likely to be at particular risk of severe disease related to COVID-19.
32415723,This statement has been developed by consensus among authors from Australia and New Zealand.
32415723,We aim to provide supportive guidance to clinicians making individual patient decisions during the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular during periods that access to healthcare resources may be limited.
32415723,General recommendations include those to minimise patient exposure to COVID-19, including the use of telehealth, avoidance of non-essential visits and minimisation of time spent by patients in infusion suites and other clinical areas.
32415723,This statement also provides recommendations where appropriate in assessing indications for therapy, reducing therapy-associated immunosuppression and reducing healthcare utilisation in patients with specific haematological malignancies during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32415723,Specific decisions regarding therapy of haematological malignancies will need to be individualised, based on disease risk, risks of immunosuppression, rates of community transmission of COVID-19 and available local healthcare resources.
32415727,SARS-CoV-2 become pandemics and there is still a dearth of data about its the potentially among dermatological patients under biologics.
32415727,We aimed to assess health literacy, disease knowledge, treatment dissatisfaction and biologics attitudes toward COVID-19.
32415727,We performed a cross-sectional, questionnaire-based survey on 98/105 consecutive dermatological patients treated with biologics-51 suffering from plaque psoriasis, 22 from atopic dermatitis, and 25 from hidradenitis suppurativa.
32415727,An ad hoc, validated questionnaire has 44 items investigating the following domains: knowledge of COVID-19 related to (a) epidemiology, (b) pathogenesis, (c) clinical symptoms, (d) preventive measures, and (e) attitudes.
32415727,Patients data and questionnaires were collected.
32415727,Despite only 8.1% thought that biologics may increase the risk of COVID-19, 18.4% and 21.4% of the patients were evaluating the possibility to discontinue or modify the dosage of the current biologic therapy, respectively.
32415727,Globally, male patients (P = .001) with higher scholarity level (P = .005) displayed higher knowledge of COVID-19.
32415727,Patients with lower DLQI (P = .006), longer disease duration (P = .051) and lower scholarity (P = .007) have thought to discontinue/modify autonomously their biologic therapy.
32415727,At the multivariate logistic regression, only the knowledge of epidemiology and preventive measures resulted independent predictors of continuation vs discontinuation and modification vs no modification, respectively.
32415727,Dermatologists should promote COVID-19 knowledge to prevent biologics disruption.
32415767,The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2), represents a major challenge for healthcare.
32415767,The involvement of cardiovascular system in COVID‑19 has been proven and increased healthcare system resources are redirected towards handling infected patients, which induces major changes in access to services and prioritization in the management of patients with chronic cardiovascular disease unrelated to COVID‑19.
32415767,In this expert opinion, conceived by the task force involving the Working Groups on Valvular Heart Diseases and Cardiac Surgery as well as the Association of Cardiovascular Intervention of the Polish Cardiac Society, modification of diagnostic pathways, principles of healthcare personnel protection, and treatment guidelines regarding triage and prioritization are suggested.
32415767,Heart Teams responsible for the treatment of valvular heart disease should continue their work using telemedicine and digital technology.
32415767,Diagnostic tests must be simplified or deferred to minimize the number of potentially dangerous aerosol‑generating procedures, such as transesophageal echocardiography or exercise imaging.
32415767,The treatment of aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation has to be offered particularly due to urgent indications and in patients with advanced disease and poor prognosis.
32415767,Expert risk stratification is essential for triage and setting the priority lists.
32415767,In each case, an appropriate level of personal protection must be ensured for the healthcare personnel to prevent spreading infection and preserve specialized manpower, who will supply the continuing need for handling serious chronic cardiovascular disease.
32415767,Importantly, as soon as the local epidemic situation improves, efforts must be made to restore standard opportunities for elective treatment of valvular heart disease and occluder‑based therapies according to existing guidelines, thus rebuilding the state ‑of ‑the ‑art cardiovascular services.
32415882,The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has rapidly transformed health care delivery around the globe.
32415882,Because of the heavy impact of COVID-19 spread, cancer treatments have necessarily been de-prioritized, thus exposing patients to increased risk of morbidity and mortality due to delayed care.
32415882,In this scenario, cancer specialists need to assess critical oncology patients case by case to carefully balance risk vs benefit in treating tumors and preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32415882,Here, we report early insights into how the management of patients with sinonasal and anterior skull base cancer might be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
32415882,We provide recommendations for preoperative tests, indications for immediate care vs possible delayed treatment, and warnings relating to dural resection and intracranial dissection, given the potential neurotropism of SARS-CoV2 and practical suggestions for managing cancer care in a period of limited resources.
32415882,We also postulate some thoughts on the promising role of telemedicine in multidisciplinary case discussions and posttreatment surveillance.
32415905,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been a pandemic worldwide.
32415905,The data about COVID-19 in renal transplant recipient is deficiency.
32415905,Herein we report two COVID-19 cases in renal transplant recipients.
32415905,Both cases were discharged following a treatment regimen including discontinued immunosuppressant and low-dose methylprednisolone-based therapy.
32415905,There were no signs of rejection during the treatment.
32415905,These successfully treated cases can provide helpful information about the management of COVID-19 in renal transplant recipients.
32416028,Infections with coronaviruses are not always confined to the respiratory tract and various neurological manifestations have been reported.
32416028,The aim of this study was to perform a review to describe neurological manifestations in patients with COVID-19 and possible neuro-invasive mechanisms of Sars-CoV-2.
32416028,Pubmed, WebOfScience and Covid-dedicated databases were searched for the combination of COVID-19 terminology and neurology terminology up to May 10<sup>th</sup> 2020.
32416028,Social media channels were followed-up between March 15<sup>th</sup> and May 10<sup>th</sup> 2020 for postings with the same scope.
32416028,Neurological manifestations were extracted from the identified manuscripts and combined to provide a useful summary for the neurologist in clinical practice.
32416028,Neurological manifestations potentially related to COVID-19 have been reported in large studies, case series and case reports and include acute cerebrovascular diseases, impaired consciousness, cranial nerve manifestations and auto-immune disorders such as Guillain-Barré Syndrome often present in patients with more severe COVID-19.
32416028,Cranial nerve symptoms such as olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions are highly prevalent in patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 even without associated nasal symptoms and often present in an early stage of the disease.
32416028,Physicians should be aware of the neurological manifestations in patients with COVID-19, especially when rapid clinical deterioration occurs.
32416028,The neurological symptoms in COVID-19 patients may be due to direct viral neurological injury or indirect neuroinflammatory and autoimmune mechanisms.
32416028,No antiviral treatments against the virus or vaccines for its prevention are available and the long-term consequences of the infection on human health remain uncertain especially with regards to the neurological system.
32416116,The rate of acute kidney injury (AKI) associated with patients hospitalized with Covid-19, and associated outcomes are not well understood.
32416116,This study describes the presentation, risk factors and outcomes of AKI in patients hospitalized with Covid-19.
32416116,We reviewed the health records for all patients hospitalized with Covid-19 between March 1, and April 5, 2020, at 13 academic and community hospitals in metropolitan New York.
32416116,Patients younger than 18 years of age, with end stage kidney disease or with a kidney transplant were excluded.
32416116,AKI was defined according to KDIGO criteria.
32416116,Of 5,449 patients admitted with Covid-19, AKI developed in 1,993 (36.6%).
32416116,The peak stages of AKI were stage 1 in 46.5%, stage 2 in 22.4% and stage 3 in 31.1%.
32416116,Of these, 14.3% required renal replacement therapy (RRT).
32416116,AKI was primarily seen in Covid-19 patients with respiratory failure, with 89.7% of patients on mechanical ventilation developing AKI compared to 21.7% of non-ventilated patients.
32416116,276/285 (96.8%) of patients requiring RRT were on ventilators.
32416116,Of patients who required ventilation and developed AKI, 52.2% had the onset of AKI within 24 hours of intubation.
32416116,Risk factors for AKI included older age, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, black race, hypertension and need for ventilation and vasopressor medications.
32416116,Among patients with AKI, 694 died (35%), 519 (26%) were discharged and 780 (39%) were still hospitalized.
32416116,AKI occurs frequently among patients with Covid-19 disease.
32416116,It occurs early and in temporal association with respiratory failure and is associated with a poor prognosis.
32416120,Hypertension and Diabetes are the most common comorbid conditions in patients with COVID-19 and has been shown to adversely impact prognosis globally.
32416120,It has been shown that hyperglycemia is one of the factors that increases the risk of poor outcomes in these patients.
32416120,These patients are usually on multiple medications and recently a series of discussion on how Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP4i) may be beneficial in these patients has been presented.
32416120,This commentary presents a nuanced debateon why the DPP4i may not bebeneficial in COVID-19 and that caution needs to be addressed in making any judgementsuntil real world data is available.
32416121,Diabetes is a risk factor for the progression and prognosis of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), but the relationship between glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level, inflammation, and prognosis of COVID-19 patients has not been explored.
32416121,This was a retrospective study of COVID-19 patients who underwent an HbA1c test.
32416121,Their demographic data, medical history, signs and symptoms of COVID-19, laboratory test results, and final outcomes of COVID-19 treatment were collected and analyzed.
32416121,A total of 132 patients were included and divided into three groups based on their blood glucose status.
32416121,There were significant differences in SaO<sub>2</sub>, serum ferritin level, C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), fibrinogen (Fbg) level, and IL6 level among the three groups.
32416121,A pairwise comparison of the groups showed that groups B and C were significantly different from group A in terms of CRP, ESR, and Fbg, IL6, and serum ferritin levels (P &lt; 0.05).
32416121,Correlation analysis showed that there was a linear negative correlation between SaO<sub>2</sub> and HbA1c (r = -0.22, P = 0.01), while there was a linear positive correlation between serum ferritin, CRP, Fbg, and ESR levels and HbA1c (P &lt; 0.05).
32416121,High HbA1c level is associated with inflammation, hypercoagulability, and low SaO<sub>2</sub> in COVID-19 patients, and the mortality rate (27.7%) is higher in patients with diabetes.
32416121,Determining HbA1c level after hospital admission is thus helpful assessing inflammation, hypercoagulability, and prognosis of COVID-19 patients.
32416259,A new betacoronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as a new threat to global health and economy.
32416259,A promising target for both diagnosis and therapeutics treatments of the new disease named COVID-19 is the coronavirus (CoV) spike (S) glycoprotein.
32416259,By constant-pH Monte Carlo simulations and the PROCEEDpKa method, we have mapped the electrostatic epitopes for four monoclonal antibodies and the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on both SARS-CoV-1 and the new SARS-CoV-2 S receptor binding domain (RBD) proteins.
32416259,We also calculated free energy of interactions and shown that the S RBD proteins from both SARS viruses binds to ACE2 with similar affinities.
32416259,However, the affinity between the S RBD protein from the new SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 is higher than for any studied antibody previously found complexed with SARS-CoV-1.
32416259,Based on physical chemical analysis and free energies estimates, we can shed some light on the involved molecular recognition processes, their clinical aspects, the implications for drug developments, and suggest structural modifications on the CR3022 antibody that would improve its binding affinities for SARS-CoV-2 and contribute to address the ongoing international health crisis.
32416289,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) represents a novel pneumonia leading to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).
32416289,Recent studies documented that SARS-Coronavirus2 (SARS-CoV2), responsible for COVID-19, can affect the nervous system.
32416289,The aim of the present observational study was to prospectively assess subjective neurological symptoms (sNS) in patients with SARS-CoV2 infection.
32416289,We included patients hospitalized at the University Hospital of Rome Tor Vergata, medical center dedicated to the treatment of patients with COVID-19 diagnosis, who underwent an anamnestic interview about sNS consisting of 13 items, each related to a specific symptom, requiring a dichotomized answer.
32416289,We included 103 patients with SARS-CoV2 infection.
32416289,Ninety-four patients (91.3%) reported at least one sNS.
32416289,Sleep impairment was the most frequent symptom, followed by dysgeusia, headache, hyposmia, and depression.
32416289,Women more frequently complained hyposmia, dysgeusia, dizziness, numbeness/paresthesias, daytime sleepiness, and muscle ache.
32416289,Moreover, muscle ache and daytime sleepiness were more frequent in the first 2 days after admission.
32416289,Conversely, sleep impairment was more frequent in patients with more than 7 days of hospitalization.
32416289,In these patients we also documented higher white blood cells and lower C-reactive protein levels.
32416289,These laboratory findings correlated with the occurrence of hyposmia, dysgeusia, headache, daytime sleepiness, and depression.
32416289,Patients with SARS-CoV2 infection frequently present with sNS.
32416289,These symptoms were present from the early phases of the disease.
32416289,The possibly intrinsic neurotropic properties of SARS-CoV2 may justify the very high frequency of sNS.
32416289,Further studies targeted at investigating the consequences of SARS-CoV2 infection on the CNS should be planned.
32416330,Treatment decisions in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic are challenging.
32416330,It is not known whether and how various disease modifying therapies, especially immunosuppressive drugs, affect COVID-19 risk and disease course.
32416330,Case report RESULTS: We report a fingolimod-treated MS patient who developed severe COVID-19 but recovered after treatment with tocilizumab.
32416330,This report suggests that a brief course of tocilizumab for the treatment of severe COVID-19 may be effective while not aggravating pre-existing MS.
32416370,The COVID-19 pandemics required several changes in stroke management and it may have influenced some clinical or functional characteristics.
32416370,We aimed to evaluate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemics on stroke management during the first month of Italy lockdown.
32416370,In addition, we described the emergency structured pathway adopted by an Italian University Hub Stroke Unit in the cross-border Italy-Slovenia area.
32416370,We analyzed admitted patients' clinical features and outcomes between 9th March 2020 and 9th April 2020 (first month of lockdown), and compared them with patients admitted during the same period in 2019.
32416370,Total admissions experienced a reduction of 45% during the lockdown compared to the same period in 2019 (16 vs 29, respectively), as well as a higher prevalence of severe stroke (NIHSS&gt;10) at admission (n = 8, 50% vs n = 8, 28%).
32416370,A dramatic prevalence of stroke of unknown symptom onset was observed in 2020 (n = 8, 50% vs n = 3, 10%).
32416370,During lockdown, worse functional and independence outcomes were found, despite the similar proportion of reperfused patients.
32416370,Similar 'symptoms alert-to-admission' and 'door-to-treatment' times were observed.
32416370,During lockdown hospitalization was shorter and fewer patients completed the stroke work-up.
32416370,In conclusion, the adopted strategies for stroke management during the COVID-19 emergency have suggested being effective, while suffering a reduced and delayed reporting of symptoms.
32416370,Therefore, we recommend raising awareness among the population against possible stroke symptoms onset.
32416370,Thus, think F.A.S.T. and do not stay-at-home at all costs.
32416415,The new coronavirus infection COVID-19 has quickly become a global health emergency.
32416415,Mortality is principally due to severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) which relays only on supportive treatment.
32416415,Numerous pathological, clinical and laboratory findings rise the similarity between moderate to severe COVID-19 and haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH).
32416415,Etoposide-based protocol including dexametasone is the standard of care for secondary HLH.
32416415,The protocol has been successfully used in HLHs that are secondary to EBV and H1N1 infections by inducing complete response and prolonged survival.
32416415,These observations prompt to consider this cytotoxic therapy in HLH associated to moderately severe to severe forms of COVID-19.
32416433,COVID 19 pandemic is a worldwide health emergency.
32416433,Every single Hospital and Department was forced to radically modify clinical practice decreasing or stopping daily activities.
32416433,Oncological patients had to carry on treatments in order to prevent disease progression and improve their quality of life.
32416433,However, many health workers may be a potential source of infection if not tested with swabs but this diagnostic procedure was not suitable universally in Italy.
32416433,Aiming to reduce hospitalization of our patients with advanced lung cancer, vinorelbine in its metronomic formulation is one of the best strategy.
32416433,Here, we report the experience with oral vinorelbine in a few patients of our Oncology Department.
32416527,The management of diabetes has become a challenge due to the COVID 19 lockdown.
32416527,An online-based pilot survey was conducted to study how people with diabetes were coping with their Diabetes during the COVID - 19 lockdown.
32416527,The questions were designed in an online survey, Survey Monkey, to conduct this cross-sectional study.
32416527,The link was generated and sent to 100 registered patients of the MV Hospital for Diabetes Royapuram who had not contacted the hospital after the lockdown announcement.
32416527,The survey was done between April 1 and April 15, 2020.
32416527,Oral consent was obtained through telephone before the link was sent by Whatsapp to them.The questionnaire consisted of questions on home blood glucose monitoring, regularity in doing their physical activity and dietary compliance and anxiety about the viral infection. 92% of the participants had Type 2 diabetes.
32416527,Only 28% of the participants were checking their blood glucose levels regularly. 80% of the participants mentioned that they were following regular exercise and diet control during the lockdown period. 40% of the participants were anxious about the Covid infection.
32416527,SMBG needs to be practiced on regular basis, especially among the patients with diabetes on insulin therapy.
32416527,Most of the people surveyed were coping well with their Diabetes.
32416527,Patients have reported that they were able to maintain proper dietary compliance and be more physically active at home during this lockdown.
32416527,These findings need to be ascertained in larger sample of patients.
32416535,There is evidence that the current outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, is of animal origin.
32416535,As with a number of zoonotic pathogens, there is a risk of spillover into novel hosts.
32416535,Here, we propose a hypothesized conceptual model that illustrates the mechanism whereby the SARS-CoV-2 could spillover from infected humans to naive wildlife hosts in North America.
32416535,This proposed model is premised on transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from human feces through municipal waste water treatment plants into the natural aquatic environment where potential wildlife hosts become infected.
32416535,We use the existing literature on human coronaviruses, including SARS CoV, to support the potential pathways and mechanisms in the conceptual model.
32416535,Although we focus on North America, our conceptual model could apply to other parts of the globe as well.
32416769,The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly evolved into a global pandemic.
32416769,Most patients with COVID-19 have mild symptoms, but about 5% develop severe symptoms, which can include acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, and multiple organ failure.
32416769,Kidney involvement is frequent, with clinical presentation ranging from mild proteinuria to progressive acute kidney injury (AKI) necessitating renal replacement therapy (RRT).
32416769,An understanding of the pathophysiology and mechanisms of kidney damage and AKI in the setting of critical illness and COVID-19 is emerging, although further research is needed to identify patients at risk of AKI and to guide management strategies.
32416769,As no specific treatment options exist for AKI secondary to COVID-19, intensive care is largely supportive.
32416769,Current approaches to prevention and management of AKI, and identification of potential indications for use of RRT and sequential extracorporeal therapies, are based mainly on clinical experience, and AKI strategies are adapted empirically to patients with COVID-19.
32416769,International collaborative and cross-disciplinary research is needed to obtain adequate evidence to support current clinical approaches and to develop new approaches to management.
32416785,Concerns have been raised about the possibility that inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) could predispose individuals to severe COVID-19; however, epidemiological evidence is lacking.
32416785,We report the results of a case-population study done in Madrid, Spain, since the outbreak of COVID-19.
32416785,In this case-population study, we consecutively selected patients aged 18 years or older with a PCR-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital from seven hospitals in Madrid, who had been admitted between March 1 and March 24, 2020.
32416785,As a reference group, we randomly sampled ten patients per case, individually matched for age, sex, region (ie, Madrid), and date of admission to hospital (month and day; index date), from Base de datos para la Investigación Farmacoepidemiológica en Atención Primaria (BIFAP), a Spanish primary health-care database, in its last available year (2018).
32416785,We extracted information on comorbidities and prescriptions up to the month before index date (ie, current use) from electronic clinical records of both cases and controls.
32416785,The outcome of interest was admission to hospital of patients with COVID-19.
32416785,To minimise confounding by indication, the main analysis focused on assessing the association between COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital and use of RAAS inhibitors compared with use of other antihypertensive drugs.
32416785,We calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs, adjusted for age, sex, and cardiovascular comorbidities and risk factors, using conditional logistic regression.
32416785,The protocol of the study was registered in the EU electronic Register of Post-Authorisation Studies, EUPAS34437.
32416785,We collected data for 1139 cases and 11 390 population controls.
32416785,Among cases, 444 (39·0%) were female and the mean age was 69·1 years (SD 15·4), and despite being matched on sex and age, a significantly higher proportion of cases had pre-existing cardiovascular disease (OR 1·98, 95% CI 1·62-2·41) and risk factors (1·46, 1·23-1·73) than did controls.
32416785,Compared with users of other antihypertensive drugs, users of RAAS inhibitors had an adjusted OR for COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital of 0·94 (95% CI 0·77-1·15).
32416785,No increased risk was observed with either angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (adjusted OR 0·80, 0·64-1·00) or angiotensin-receptor blockers (1·10, 0·88-1·37).
32416785,Sex, age, and background cardiovascular risk did not modify the adjusted OR between use of RAAS inhibitors and COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital, whereas a decreased risk of COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital was found among patients with diabetes who were users of RAAS inhibitors (adjusted OR 0·53, 95% CI 0·34-0·80).
32416785,The adjusted ORs were similar across severity degrees of COVID-19.
32416785,RAAS inhibitors do not increase the risk of COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital, including fatal cases and those admitted to intensive care units, and should not be discontinued to prevent a severe case of COVID-19.

32417070,Community pharmacies provide an important healthcare service, which is broadly established, and constitutes the preferred and initial contact for members of the community.
32417070,The significant value of community pharmacies was further highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic crisis.
32417070,The assessment of community pharmacies preparedness for the COVID-19 pandemic.
32417070,A cross-sectional interview survey of 1018 community pharmacies working in four regions of Egypt (South, East, Centre, and North).
32417070,Data collection was conducted from 8-19 April 2020.
32417070,Availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) and medication was better than alcohol (70% conc.).
32417070,Home delivery services were available in 49.1% of pharmacies.
32417070,Infection control measures covering interactions between staff were in place in up to 99.5% of pharmacies.
32417070,Conversely, there was less frequent availability of contactless payment (29.1%), hand sanitizers (62.1%) or masks (86.5%) for customer use, or a separate area for patients with suspected COVID-19 (64%).
32417070,Verbal customer education (90.4%) was used preferably to written (81.3%).
32417070,Despite high clinical knowledge and awareness (97.6%-99.2%), only 8.8% of pharmacists had reported suspected COVID-19 cases, however this varied significantly with pharmacist demographics (geographic region P &lt; 0.001; pandemic training p &lt; 0.001; position p = 0.019; age p = 0.046).
32417070,Government and policymakers strive to mitigate the shortage of PPE and medication.
32417070,More attention should be given to infection control measures around interactions between staff and customers to ensure community pharmacists are fit and able to provide continuity in their important role.
32417070,Educating customers using regularly-updated posters, banners or signs will contribute to decreasing contact with patients, and reducing the number and duration of visits to the pharmacy.
32417070,Pandemic preparedness of community pharmacists must also extend to reporting procedures.
32417070,By avoiding under-reporting or over-reporting, community pharmacists will contribute to accurate monitoring of the national spread of infection.
32417123,This concise manuscript aims to make suggestions for a small step forward in both preventative and therapeutic measures against the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) pandemic.
32417123,This targeted strategy consists of using fully recovered COVID 19 Heroes, that is, brave volunteers, as the source of antibodies in plasma collected by plasmapheresis or affinity column- derived antibodies, both are sterilised and pathogen inactivated for substitution therapy for use in those populations in need of antibody.
32417123,This include for use in critically ill COVID 19 patients and as a preventative measure, in those at potential risk of infection as no vaccine is yet available.
32417123,This would be a small step forward, while we are waiting to produce an effective, validated vaccine and witnessing increasing demands for testing and self-isolation which are the two most effective current strategies.
32417123,In line with this concept, some methodological aspects of the use of the UVC sterilization of FFP/ cryoprecipitate-depleted FFP or immunoglobulins containing neutralizing antibodies for clinical use against COVID-19 are highlighted.
32417123,The plasmapheresis procedure is, of course, particularly targeted to male donors, who consist of about 75 % of the COVID-19 population and who are able to undergo multiple double, or even triple plasmapheresis procedures.
32417123,Moreover, as some of these donors have already been in an induced-hypercoagulable state and prone to thrombosis and DVT, this strategy will be partially aimed at improving their health with the use of citrate based anticoagulants and removal of high molecular weight viscous components which contribute to the untoward clinical effects of DVT.
32417123,Repeated targeted plasmapheresis or plasma exchange of selected COVID-19 positive individuals would undoubtedly lower their state of hypercoagulability and normalize their hypercoagulability.
32417123,The recipients of such a derived FFP-product would benefit from the two to 3 doses of viral inactivated antibodies, which could neutralize the viral antigens even at very low concentration if present in the early stage.
32417123,So, this practice would be a double-edged sword with benefits for both donors and recipients.
32417136,A patient with severe CRSwNP, asthma, and NSAIDS received dupilumab treatment.
32417136,Three weeks after therapy onset, the patient was diagnosed with Covid-19, had a mild course of the disease, and fully recovered from the infection.
32417164,The treatment of sleep disorders has been strongly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
32417164,When the lockdown is over, resumption of usual patient care will require precautions to limit the risk of contamination for patients and caregivers.
32417164,In this document, the French Association of Otorhinolaryngology and Sleep disorders (AFSORL) and the French Society of Otorhinolaryngology (SFORL) put forward a summary of the measures for continuing the treatment of sleep apnoea syndrome in these new practice conditions.
32417164,Emphasis is placed on teleconsultation, methods of nocturnal sleep studies, the conditions for treatment by continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) ventilation, and the postponement of more invasive treatments.
32417210,The underlying changes of peripheral blood inflammatory cells (PBICs) in COVID-19 patients are little known.
32417210,Moreover, the risk factors for the underlying changes of PBICs and their predicting role in severe COVID-19 patients remain uncertain.
32417210,This retrospective study including two cohorts: the main cohort enrolling 45 patients of severe type serving as study group, and the secondary cohort enrolling 12 patients of no-severe type serving as control group.
32417210,The PBICs analysis was based on blood routine and lymphocyte subsets.
32417210,The inflammatory cell levels were compared among patients according to clinical classifications, disease-associated phases, as well as one-month outcomes.
32417210,Compared with patients of non-severe type, the patients of severe type suffered from significantly decreased counts of lymphocytes, eosinophils, basophils, but increased counts of neutrophils.
32417210,These PBICs alterations got improved in recovery phase, but persisted or got worse in aggravated phase.
32417210,Compared with patients in discharged group, the patients in un-discharged/died group suffered from decreased counts of total T lymphocytes, CD4 + T lymphocytes, CD8 + T lymphocytes, as well as NK cells at 2 weeks after treatment.
32417210,Clinical classification-critically severe was the independently risk factor for lymphopenia (OR = 7.701, 95%CI:1.265-46.893, P = 0.027), eosinopenia (OR = 5.595, 95%CI:1.008-31.054, P = 0.049), and worse one-month outcome (OR = 8.984; 95%CI:1.021-79.061, P = 0.048).
32417210,Lymphopenia and eosinopenia may serve as predictors of disease severity and disease progression in COVID-19 patients, and enhancing the cellular immunity may contribute to COVID-19 treatment.
32417210,Thus, PBICs might become a sentinel of COVID-19, and it deserves attention during COVID-19 treatment.
32417380,Since coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, the number of cases has risen exponentially.
32417380,Clinical characteristics and outcomes among patients with orthotopic heart transplant (OHT) with COVID-19 remain poorly described.
32417380,We performed a retrospective case series of patients with OHT with COVID-19 admitted to 1 of 2 hospitals in Southeastern Michigan between March 21 and April 22, 2020.
32417380,Clinical data were obtained through review of the electronic medical record.
32417380,Final date of follow-up was May 7, 2020.
32417380,Demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiologic, treatment, and mortality data were collected and analyzed.
32417380,We identified 13 patients with OHT admitted with COVID-19.
32417380,The mean age of patients was 61 ± 12 years, 100% were black males, and symptoms began 6 ± 4 days before admission.
32417380,The most common symptoms included subjective fever (92%), shortness of breath (85%), and cough (77%).
32417380,Six patients (46%) required admission to the intensive care unit.
32417380,Two patients (15%) died during hospitalization.
32417380,Black men may be at increased risk for COVID-19 among patients with OHT.
32417380,Presenting signs and symptoms in this cohort are similar to those in the general population.
32417380,Elevated inflammatory markers on presentation appear to be associated with more severe illness.
32417446,Allergen immunotherapy (AIT) is safe and effective but is typically administered under strict clinic observation to mitigate the risk of a systemic reaction to immunotherapy (SRIT).
32417446,However, in the setting of the global coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, alternative care models should be explored.
32417446,To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of home immunotherapy self-administration (HITSA) in a highly idealized circumstance for provision of maintenance AIT in a shelter-in-place or other scenarios of unforeseen reduction in nonessential medical services.
32417446,Markov modeling was used to compare in-office clinic AIT in selected patients using cohort analysis and microsimulation from the societal and health care perspectives.
32417446,Assuming similar SRIT rates, HITSA was found to be a cost-effective option with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $44,554/quality-adjusted life-year when considering both incremental epinephrine autoinjector costs and coronavirus disease 2019 risks.
32417446,Excluding epinephrine autoinjector costs, HISTA dominated other options.
32417446,However, outside of pandemic considerations, HITSA was not cost-effective (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, $198,877,286) at annual epinephrine autoinjector costs above $287.
32417446,As the incremental HITSA SRIT rate increased above 15%, clinic AIT was the most cost-effective strategy.
32417446,Excluding both pandemic risks and risk of motor vehicle accident fatality from round-trip clinic transit, clinic AIT dominated other strategies.
32417446,Clinic AIT was the more cost-effective option at very high fatality relative risk for HITSA or at very low annual risk of contracting coronavirus disease 2019.
32417446,Under idealized assumptions HITSA can be a safe and cost-effective option during a global pandemic in appropriately selected patients provided home rates of SRIT remain stable.
32417555,Sewage can be used to determine the scale of COVID-19 outbreak.
32417555,Sewage Epidemiology or Waste Based Epidemiology (WBE) approach has been successfully used to track and provide early warnings of outbreaks of pathogenic viruses such as Hepatitis A, Poliovirus and Norovirus.
32417555,In untreated wastewater COVID-19 (excreted via faeces then introduced to wastewater) can survive from hours to days.
32417555,Detection of COVID-19 can be carried out with nucleic acid-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, used for confirmation of COVID-19 patients around the globe.
32417555,New cheaper and faster monitoring tools are being developed to detect Covid-19 in wastewater by biosensors, ELISA, or paper-based indicator methods.
32417555,This will allow to reveal true scale of Covid-19 outbreak associated with population link to a specific wastewater treatment plant.
32417708,The role of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in the treatment of COVID-19 is not fully known.
32417708,We studied the efficacy of HCQ compared to the control in COVID-19 subjects on - a. viral clearance measured by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and, b. death due to all cause.
32417708,PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane and MedRxiv database were searched using the specific keywords up to April 30, 2020.
32417708,Studies that met our objectives were assessed for the risk of bias applying various tools as indicated.
32417708,Three studies each that reported the outcome of viral clearance by RT-PCR and death due to all cause, were meta-analyzed by applying inverse variance-weighted averages of logarithmic risk ratio (RR) using a random effects model.
32417708,Heterogeneity and publication bias were assessed using the I<sup>2</sup> statistic and funnel plots, respectively.
32417708,Meta-analysis of 3 studies (n = 210) on viral clearance assessed by RT-PCR showed no benefit (RR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.79 to 1.38; p = 0.74), although with a moderate heterogeneity (I<sup>2</sup> = 61.7%, p = 0.07).
32417708,While meta-analysis of 3 studies (n = 474) showed a significant increase in death with HCQ, compared to the control (RR, 2.17; 95% 1.32 to 3.57; p = 0.002), without any heterogeneity (I<sup>2</sup> = 0.0%, p = 0.43).
32417708,No benefit on viral clearance but a significant increase in mortality was observed with HCQ compared to control in patients with COVID-19.
32417709,The outbreak of the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, causes a respiratory disease and individuals with pre-existing cardiometabolic disorders display worse prognosis through the infection course.
32417709,The aim of this minireview is to present epidemiological data related to metabolic comorbidities in association with the SARS-CoV-2.
32417709,This is a narrative mini-review with Pubmed search until April 23, 2020 using the keywords COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, treatment of coronavirus and following terms: diabetes mellitus, obesity, arterial hypertension, ACE-inhibitors, cytokine storm, immune response and vitamin D.
32417709,Studies indicate that obese individuals are more likely to develop infections, and that adipose tissue serves as a pathogen reservoir.
32417709,In diabetic individuals higher rate of inflammatory processes is seen due to constant glucose recognition by C type lectin receptors.
32417709,Hypertensive individuals, usually grouped with other conditions, are treated with drugs to reduce blood pressure mostly through ACEi and ARB, that leads to increased ACE2 expression, used by SARS-CoV-2 for human's cell entry.
32417709,Until now, the studies have shown that individuals with those conditions and affected by COVID-19 present an uncontrolled release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and an unbalanced immune response, leading to the cytokine storm phenomenon.
32417709,Vitamin D is highlighted as a potential therapeutic target, because in addition to acting on the immune system, it plays an important role in the control of cardiometabolic diseases.
32417709,Currently, since there is no proven and effective antiviral therapy for SARS-CoV-2, the efforts should focus on controlling inflammatory response and reduce the risks of associated complications.
32417802,The COVID-19 pandemic represents the greatest challenge to date faced by the medical community in the 21st century.
32417802,The rate of rapid dissemination, magnitude of viral contagiousness, person to person transmission at an asymptomatic phase of illness pose a unique and dangerous challenge for all patients, including neonatal and obstetric patients.
32417802,Although scientific understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease, nature of transmission, and efficacy of mitigation strategies grow, neither a cure or vaccine have been developed.
32417802,While COVID-19 is primarily a disease of older patients, infection is now seen across all age demographics with reports of illness in pregnant patients and infants.
32417802,Altered hormone status and predominance of Th-2 immune helper cells may result in increased predisposition to SARS-CoV-2.
32417802,Case reports of pregnant patients demonstrate a clinical presentation comparable to non-pregnant adults, but evidence of vertical transmission to the fetus is controversial.
32417802,Neonatal reports demonstrate an inconsistent and non-specific phenotype, and it is often difficult to separate COVID-19 from the underlying conditions of prematurity or bacterial infection.
32417802,The development of international registries to enable risk profiling of COVID-19 positive pregnant mothers and/or their offspring may facilitate the development of enhanced mitigation strategies, medical treatments and effective vaccinations.
32417870,Pandemic outbreak of COVID-19 is the largest of its kind of this century.
32417870,All countries throughout the globe are trying their best to contain the disease and eliminate at the earliest.
32417870,Efforts are continuing to improve the outcome of the infection in terms of minimizing the morbidity and mortality.
32417870,As a public health strategy every state has the responsibility of protecting the health of the community and such measures includes the preventive measures like social distancing or even lockdown of the state as a whole restricting the movement of the people, diagnostic measures like testing the suspects, contact tracing and isolation of the patients.
32417870,Treatment of the infected requires decisions in resource constraint situation particularly ICU beds and ventilators.
32417870,In the meantime, protecting doctors, nurses, other health workers as well as frontline workers need personal protective equipment which is a scarce commodity.
32417870,While doing so there might be a compromise in the individual autonomy, privacy, confidentiality, and social justice for the beneficence for the larger community.
32417870,This is an attempt to explore the ethical quandaries in relation to combating COVID-19 in Nepal by relating the issues with the principles of biomedical ethics.
32417878,In an effort to expedite the publication of articles related to the COVID-19 pandemic, AJHP is posting these manuscripts online as soon as possible after acceptance.
32417878,Accepted manuscripts have been peer-reviewed and copyedited, but are posted online before technical formatting and author proofing.
32417878,These manuscripts are not the final version of record and will be replaced with the final article (formatted per AJHP style and proofed by the authors) at a later time.
32417878,This report describes a health-system pharmacy's response to a natural disaster while staff members simultaneously prepared for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
32417878,By detailing our experience, we hope to help other institutions that are current facing or could encounter similar crises.
32417878,In early March 2020, a tornado destroyed the health system's warehouse for storage of most clinical supplies, including personal protective equipment and fluids.
32417878,The pharmacy purchasing team collaborated with suppliers and manufacturers to recover losses and establish alternative storage areas.
32417878,Days later, the pharmacy department was forced to address the impending COVID-19 pandemic.
32417878,Key elements of the COVID-19 response included reducing the potential for patient and staff virus exposure; overcoming challenges in sourcing of staff, personal protective equipment, and medications; and changing care delivery practices to maintain high-quality patient care while maximizing social distancing.
32417878,The pharmacy department also created distance learning opportunities for 70 pharmacy students on rotations.
32417878,After an initial plan, ongoing needs include adjustment in patient care activities if significant staff losses occur, when and how to resume clinical activities, and how to best utilize the resources accumulated.
32417878,Elements of practice changes implemented to reduce COVID-19 threats to patients and pharmacy personnel have proven beneficial and will be further evaluated for potential continuation.
32417878,The pharmacy department's efforts to respond to a natural disaster and unprecedented pandemic have proven successful to this point and have illuminated several lessons, including the necessity of cohesive department communication, staff flexibility, prioritization of teamwork, and external collaboration.
32418028,In December 2019, a novel coronavirus was identified as the cause of many pneumonia cases in China and eventually declared as a pandemic as the virus spread globally.
32418028,Few reports were published on the outcome of surgical procedures in diagnosed COVID-19 patients and even fewer on the surgical outcomes of asymptomatic undiagnosed COVID-19 surgical patients.
32418028,We aimed to review all published data regarding surgical outcomes of preoperatively asymptomatic untested coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients.
32418028,This report is a review on the perioperative period in COVID-19 patients who were preoperatively asymptomatic and not tested for COVID-19.
32418028,Searches were conducted in PubMed April 4th, 2020.
32418028,All publications, of any design, were considered for inclusion.
32418028,Four reports were identified through our literature search, comprising 64 COVID-19 carriers, of them 51 were diagnosed only in the postoperative period.
32418028,Synthesis of these reports, concerning the postoperative outcomes of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 during the perioperative period, suggested a 14/51 (27.5%) postoperative mortality rate and severe mostly pulmonic complications, as well as medical staff exposure and transmission.
32418028,COVID-19 may have potential hazardous implications on the perioperative course.
32418028,Our review presents results of unacceptable mortality rate and a high rate of severe complications.
32418028,These observations warrant further well-designed studies, yet we believe it is time for a global consideration of sampling all asymptomatic patients before surgical treatment.
32418114,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic with no specific drugs and high fatality.
32418114,The most urgent need is to find effective treatments.
32418114,We sought to determine whether hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) application may reduce the death risk of critically ill COVID-19 patients.
32418114,In this retrospective study, we included 550 critically ill COVID-19 patients who need mechanical ventilation in Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, from February 1, 2020 to April 4, 2020.
32418114,All 550 patients received comparable basic treatments including antiviral drugs and antibiotics, and 48 of them were treated with oral HCQ treatment (200 mg twice a day for 7-10 days) in addition to the basic treatments.
32418114,Primary endpoint is fatality of patients, and inflammatory cytokine levels were compared between HCQ and non-hydroxychloroquine (NHCQ) treatments.
32418114,We found that fatalities are 18.8% (9/48) in HCQ group, which is significantly lower than 47.4% (238/502) in the NHCQ group (P&lt;0.001).
32418114,The time of hospital stay before patient death is 15 (10-21) days and 8 (4-14) days for the HCQ and NHCQ groups, respectively (P&lt;0.05).
32418114,The levels of inflammatory cytokine IL-6 were significantly reduced from 22.2 (8.3-118.9) pg mL<sup>-1</sup> at the beginning of the treatment to 5.2 (3.0-23.4) pg mL<sup>-1</sup> (P&lt;0.05) at the end of the treatment in the HCQ group but there is no change in the NHCQ group.
32418114,These data demonstrate that addition of HCQ on top of the basic treatments is highly effective in reducing the fatality of critically ill patients of COVID-19 through attenuation of inflammatory cytokine storm.
32418114,Therefore, HCQ should be prescribed as a part of treatment for critically ill COVID-19 patients, with possible outcome of saving lives. hydroxychloroquine, IL-6, mortalities, COVID-19.
32418146,COVID-19 was declared a global health emergency.
32418146,Since children are less than 1% of reported cases, there is limited information to develop evidence-based practice recommendations.
32418146,The objective of this study was to rapidly gather expert knowledge and experience to guide the care of children with chronic kidney disease during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32418146,A four-round multi-center Delphi exercise was conducted among 13 centers in 11 European countries of the European Pediatric Dialysis Working Group (EPDWG) between March, 16th and 20th 2020.
32418146,Results were analyzed using a mixed methods qualitative approach and descriptive statistics.
32418146,Thirteen COVID-19 specific topics of particular need for guidance were identified.
32418146,Main themes encompassed testing strategies and results (n = 4), changes in use of current therapeutics (n = 3), preventive measurements of transmission and management of COVID-19 (n = 3), and changes in standard clinical care (n = 3).
32418146,Patterns of center-specific responses varied according to regulations and to availability of guidelines.
32418146,As limited quantitative evidence is available in real time during the rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, qualitative expert knowledge and experience represent the best evidence available.
32418146,This Delphi exercise demonstrates that use of mixed methodologies embedded in an established network of experts allowed prompt analysis of pediatric nephrologists' response to COVID-19 during this fast-emerging public health crisis.
32418146,Such rapid sharing of knowledge and local practices is essential to timely and optimal guidance for medical management of specific patient groups in multi-country health care systems such as those of Europe and the US.
32418181,COVID-19 infection has shown rapid growth worldwide, and different therapies have been proposed for treatment, in particular, the combination of immune response modulating drugs such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine (antimalarials) alone or in combination with azithromycin.
32418181,Although the clinical evidence supporting their use is scarce, the off label use of these drugs has spread very quickly in face of the progression of the epidemic and the high mortality rate in susceptible populations.
32418181,However, these medications can pathologically prolong the QT interval and lead to malignant ventricular arrhythmias such that organized guidance on QT evaluation and management strategies are important to reduce morbidity associated with the potential large-scale use.
32418190,At present, there is no definitive antiviral treatment for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32418190,We describe our early experience with remdesivir in four critically ill COVID-19 patients.
32418190,Patients received a 200 mg loading dose, followed by 100 mg daily intravenously for up to 10 days.
32418190,All patients had been previously treated with other antivirals before remdesivir initiation.
32418190,One patient experienced a torsade de pointes requiring cardiac resuscitation and one died due to multiple organ failure.
32418190,Three patients showed biochemical signs of liver injury.
32418190,Lymphocyte count increased in all patients soon after remdesivir initiation.
32418190,Nasal swab SARS-CoV-2 RNA became negative in three of four patients after 3 days of therapy.
32418190,We observed an in vivo virological effect of remdesivir in four critically ill, COVID-19 patients, coupled with a significant burden of adverse events.
32418190,Although limited by the low number of subjects studied, our preliminary experience may be relevant for clinicians treating COVID-19.
32418199,Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) has been established as the functional host receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for the current devastating worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32418199,ACE2 is abundantly expressed in a variety of cells residing in many different human organs.
32418199,In human physiology, ACE2 is a pivotal counter-regulatory enzyme to ACE by the breakdown of angiotensin II, the central player in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and the main substrate of ACE2.
32418199,Many factors have been associated with both altered ACE2 expression and COVID-19 severity and progression, including age, sex, ethnicity, medication and several co-morbidities, such as cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome.
32418199,Although ACE2 is widely distributed in various human tissues and many of its determinants have been well recognised, ACE2-expressing organs do not equally participate in COVID-19 pathophysiology, implying that other mechanisms are involved in orchestrating cellular infection resulting in tissue damage.
32418199,Reports of pathologic findings in tissue specimens of COVID-19 patients are rapidly emerging and confirm the established role of ACE2 expression and activity in disease pathogenesis.
32418199,Identifying pathologic changes caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucially important as it has major implications for understanding COVID-19 pathophysiology and the development of evidence-based treatment strategies.
32418199,Currently, many interventional strategies are being explored in ongoing clinical trials, encompassing many drug classes and strategies, including antiviral drugs, biological response modifiers and RAAS inhibitors.
32418199,Ultimately, prevention is key to combat COVID-19 and appropriate measures are being taken accordingly, including development of effective vaccines.
32418199,In this review, we describe the role of ACE2 in COVID-19 pathophysiology, including factors influencing ACE2 expression and activity in relation to COVID-19 severity.
32418199,In addition, we discuss the relevant pathological changes resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32418199,Finally, we highlight a selection of potential treatment modalities for COVID-19.

32418213,For the past several months, we have witnessed one of the greatest global health challenges experienced by humankind.
32418213,This unprecedented COVID-19 viral pandemic, characterized by its enigmatic nature and bewildering spread, respects no borders and has nearly paralyzed healthcare systems throughout the world.
32418213,Indeed, in the absence of specific, proven medical interventions, healthcare systems have been overwhelmed, thus limiting their ability to treat patients with non-emergent medical conditions and those awaiting elective procedures.
32418213,Although it is beyond the scope of this editorial to discuss what constitutes a necessary or elective procedure, this radical change in medical practice has had an enormous impact on discontinuation of fertility care services, especially the assisted reproductive technologies (ART).
32418213,It is eminently clear that reducing or discontinuing elective procedures and essential ART treatments was crucial not only to enable hospitals and medical facilities to manage (or to treat) the explosive rise in SARS-CoV-2 patients, but also to reduce disease transmission vis-à-vis various mitigating strategies-especially individual isolation and social distancing, strategies utilized effectively in China and Italy.
32418288,Covid-19 infection has the potential for targeting the central nervous system and several neurological symptoms have been described in patients with severe respiratory distress.
32418288,Here we described the case of a 60-year old subject with SARS-CoV-2 infection but only mild respiratory abnormalities who developed an akinetic mutism due to encephalitis.
32418288,MRI was negative whereas EEG showed generalized theta slowing.
32418288,CSF analyses during the acute stage were negative for SARS-CoV-2, positive for pleocytosis and hyperproteinorrachia, and showed increased IL-8 and TNF-α concentrations while other infectious or autoimmune disorders were excluded.
32418288,A progressive clinical improvement along with a reduction of CSF parameters was observed after high-dose steroid treatment, thus arguing for an inflammatory-mediated brain involvement related to Covid-19.

32418327,A bright spot in the SARS-CoV-2 (CoV-2) coronavirus pandemic has been the immediate mobilization of the biomedical community, working to develop treatments and vaccines for COVID-19.
32418327,Rational drug design against emerging threats depends on well-established methodology, mainly utilizing X-ray crystallography, to provide accurate structure models of the macromolecular drug targets and of their complexes with candidates for drug development.
32418327,In the current crisis the structural biological community has responded by presenting structure models of CoV-2 proteins and depositing them in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), usually without time embargo and before publication.
32418327,Since the structures from the first-line research are produced in an accelerated mode, there is an elevated chance of mistakes and errors, with the ultimate risk of hindering, rather than speeding-up, drug development.
32418327,In the present work, we have used model-validation metrics and examined the electron density maps for the deposited models of CoV-2 proteins and a sample of related proteins available in the PDB as of 1 April 2020.
32418327,We present these results with the aim of helping the biomedical community establish a better-validated pool of data.
32418327,The proteins are divided into groups according to their structure and function.
32418327,In most cases, no major corrections were necessary.
32418327,However, in several cases significant revisions in the functionally sensitive area of protein-inhibitor complexes or for bound ions justified correction, re-refinement, and eventually re-versioning in the PDB.
32418327,The re-refined coordinate files and a tool for facilitating model comparisons are available at https://covid-19.bioreproducibility.org.
32418377,<b>Objective:</b> To investigate the relationship between novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) and kidney injury. <b>Methods:</b> A retrospective analysis was performed on COVID-19 confirmed patients in the Central Theater Command General Hospital of Chinese PLA on March 12, 2020.
32418377,A total of 87 hospitalized COVID-19 confirmed patients were enrolled in the study, and they were hospitalized at least one week.
32418377,The recorded information included clinical data and indicators of kidney-related laboratory tests. <b>Results:</b> The average age of patients was (65.2±17.1) years, and 34.5% (30/87) patients were ≥ 75 years old and 31.0% (27/87) patients were 60~74 years old.
32418377,Male and female patients accounted for 59.8% (52/87) and 40.2% (35/87), respectively.
32418377,There were 29.9% (26/87) and 12.6% (11/87) patients who had already showed mild elevation of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (SCr) at admission.
32418377,Moreover, 25.3% (22/87) and 4.6% (4/87) patients still exhibited mild elevation of BUN and SCr one week after admission.
32418377,However, 28.7% (25/87) patients showed an elevation of BUN one week later after admission, though their BUN levels were normal at admission.
32418377,Likewise, 16.1% (14/87) patients showed an elevation of SCr one week later after admission, while their SCr levels were normal at admission.
32418377,Only two patients had an increase of SCr ≥26.5 μmol/L, and both of them were over 75 years old. <b>Conclusions:</b> COVID-19 patients with severe acute kidney injury are uncommon.
32418377,However, attention should be paid to acute kidney injury of the elderly patients in the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19. <b>目的：</b> 分析新型冠状病毒肺炎（COVID-19）与肾损伤的关系。
32418377,<b>方法：</b> 收集2020年3月12日当天正在解放军中部战区总医院感染内科住院的87例COVID-19确诊患者入院时和入院1周后的临床资料及肾脏相关实验室检查结果，并进行回顾性分析。
32418377,<b>结果：</b> 患者年龄（65.2±17.1）岁，其中男性占59.8%（52/87），女性占40.2%（35/87），75岁及以上的患者占比34.5%（30/87），60~74岁占比31.0%（27/87）。
32418377,入院时患者即存在血尿素氮（BUN）和血清肌酐（SCr）升高的比例分别为29.9%（26/87）和12.6%（11/87），入院1周后上述指标异常的比例分别为25.3%（22/87）和4.6%（4/87）。
32418377,入院时BUN正常，1周后较入院时升高的患者占比28.7%（25/87）。
32418377,入院时SCr正常，1周后较入院时升高的患者占比16.1%（14/87），升高幅度≥26.5 μmol/L的患者仅2例，均为75岁以上老年人。
32418377,<b>结论：</b> COVID-19患者严重肾损伤的情况并不多见，新型冠状病毒导致急性肾损伤的可能性较小，但应注意COVID-19老年患者在诊疗过程中可能合并的肾损伤。.
32418446,<b>Background:</b> Cardiac injury and myocarditis have been described in adults with COVID-19.
32418446,SARS-CoV-2 infection in children is typically minimally symptomatic.
32418446,We report a series of febrile pediatric patients with acute heart failure potentially associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) as defined by the US Centers for Disease Control. <b>Methods:</b> Over a two-month period contemporary with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in France and Switzerland, we retrospectively collected clinical, biological, therapeutic, and early outcomes data in children who were admitted to pediatric intensive care units in 14 centers for cardiogenic shock, left ventricular dysfunction and severe inflammatory state. <b>Results:</b> Thirty-five children were identified and included in the study.
32418446,Median age at admission was 10 years (range 2-16 years).
32418446,Co-morbidities were present in 28% including asthma and overweight.
32418446,Gastrointestinal symptoms were prominent.
32418446,Left ventricular ejection fraction was &lt;30% in one third; 80% required inotropic support with 28% treated with ECMO.
32418446,Inflammation markers were suggestive of cytokine storm (interleukin 6 median 135 pg/mL) and macrophage activation (D-dimer median 5284 ng/mL).
32418446,Mean brain natriuretic peptide was elevated (5743 pg/mL).
32418446,Thirty-one/35 (88%) patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by PCR of nasopharyngeal swab or serology.
32418446,All patients received intravenous immune globulin, with adjunctive steroid therapy used in one third.
32418446,Left ventricular function was restored in the 25/35 of those discharged from the intensive care unit.
32418446,No patient died, and all patients treated with ECMO were successfully weaned. <b>Conclusion:</b> Children may experience an acute cardiac decompensation due to severe inflammatory state following SARS-CoV-2 infection (multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children - MIS-C).
32418446,Treatment with immune globulin appears to be associated with recovery of left ventricular systolic function.
32418460,The COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 (Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2) represents the third human affliction attributed to the highly pathogenic coronavirus in the current century.
32418460,Due to its highly contagious nature and unprecedented global spread, its aggressive clinical presentation and the lack of effective treatment, SARS-CoV-2 infection is causing the losses of thousands of lives and imparting unparalleled strains on healthcare systems around the world.
32418460,In the current report, we discuss perioperative considerations for patients undergoing cardiac surgery and provide clinicians with recommendations to effectively triage and plan these procedures during the COVID-19 outbreak.
32418460,This will help reduce the risk of exposure to patients and healthcare workers and allocate resources appropriately to those in greatest need.
32418460,We include an algorithm for preoperative testing for COVID-19, personal protective equipment (PPE) recommendations, and a classification system to categorize and prioritize common cardiac surgery procedures.
32418463,Medicine and public health have traditionally separated the prevention and treatment of communicable and non-communicable diseases.
32418463,The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has challenged this paradigm, particularly in the setting of cardiovascular disease (CVD).
32418463,Overall, individuals with underlying CVD who acquire severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 experience up to a ten-fold higher case-fatality rate compared to the general population.
32418463,While the impact of the pandemic on cardiovascular health continues to evolve, few have defined this association from a frontline, public health perspective of populations disproportionately affected by CVD and COVID-19.
32418463,Louisiana is ranked within the bottom five states for cardiovascular health, and is home to several parishes that have experienced among the highest COVID-19 case-fatality rates nationally.
32418463,Here, we review CVD prevention and implications of COVID-19 in New Orleans, Louisiana, a city holding a sobering yet, resilient history with previous public health disasters.
32418463,In particular, we discuss potential pandemic-driven changes in access to healthcare, preventive pharmacotherapy, and lifestyle behaviors, all of which may adversely affect CVD prevention and management, while amplifying racial disparities.
32418463,Through this process, we highlight proposed recommendations for how CVD prevention efforts can be improved in midst of the current COVID-19 pandemic and future public health crises.
32418532,SARS-CoV-2 / COVID-19 and the 'Renin-Angiotensin' System The ubiquitous 'Renin-Angiotensin' system (RAS), also referred to as 'Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone' system, plays a crucial physiological role in humans as being a key regulator of renal, cardiovascular and innate immune functions [1, 2].
32418532,It appears to work in tandem with vitamin D, a secosteroid pro-hormone which reportedly acts as a negative regulatory factor of the RAS [3-6].
32418532,A dysfunction (e.g. over-reactivity) of RAS, together with hypovitaminosis D, is likely associated with some of the various renal, cardiac, vascular and immune outcomes that might be observed in COVID-19 patients, including the cytokine storm (i.e. unopposed hyperactive immune reaction generating both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines) and consequent lethal acute respiratory distress syndrome [1, 7].
32418532,Recently, SARS-CoV-2 [8, 9], the causative agent of COVID-19, has been described to interfere with the RAS [2] by interacting -via its spike (S) glycoprotein- with the metallopeptidase Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor [9, 10] that is expressed at the surface of epithelial cells from blood vessels, lung, kidney (renal tubules), intestine, and heart, as well as on cerebral neurons and immune monocytes/macrophages [11-13].
32418532,The main SARS-CoV-2-related COVID-19 symptoms/diseases reported hitherto are hypertension, atherosclerosis, thrombosis (coagulopathy), diarrhea, glaucoma, anosmia, ageusia, skin lesions (dermatitis), autoimmune inflammation of the central nervous system, and damages to various organs such as the lung, heart, kidney, and testicle [1, 2, 14].
32418532,All these diffuse COVID-19 disorders are likely linked to an over-reaction of RAS in SARS-CoV-2-infected persons.
32418532,Such a RAS imbalance would be also favored by hypovitaminosis D [2-7, 11].
32418532,Since RAS appears to be central in COVID-19 symptoms/diseases, selective targeting of key component(s) of this system might be appropriate to treat RAS-dependent disorders.
32418532,COVID-19 Disorders: 'Renin-Angiotensin' System (RAS) &amp; Counter-regulatory RAS In the RAS pathway [1, 15], Renin (kidney) cleaves Angiotensinogen (liver) to give Angiotensin I (i.e. peptide DRVYIHPFHL).
32418532,The latter is cleaved by the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) to produce Angiotensin II (i.e. peptide DRVYIHPF), which is the substrate of ACE2 (SARS-CoV-2 receptor) and key player of the RAS.
32418532,The cellular targets of Angiotensin II are the vasoconstrictor type 1 (AT1R) and vasodilatator type 2 (AT2R) Angiotensin II receptors (AT1R is expressed at the surface of monocytes/macrophages and T-cells indicating that RAS acts on innate immunity in host).
32418532,When cleaved by ACE2, Angiotensin II gives Angiotensin 1-7 (i.e. peptide DRVYIHP), targeting the vasodilatator proto-oncogene Mas receptor (MasR).
32418532,Angiotensin 1-7 can be further transformed to Alamandine (i.e. peptide ARVYIHP) by an aspartate decarboxylase.
32418532,Alamandine would bind to the vasodilatator Mas-related G protein-coupled receptor member D (MRGD) thus promoting most of the Angiotensin 1-7-like effects.
32418532,Angiotensin II can produce Angiotensin A (i.e. peptide ARVYIHPF) via an aspartate decarboxylase, and Alamandine via an additional ACE2 cleavage.
32418532,ACE2 can also cleave Angiotensin I to form Angiotensin 1-9 (i.e. peptide DRVYIHPFH), which targets AT2R.
32418532,In the RAS pathway were finally evidenced the related Angiotensin III (i.e. peptide RVYIHPF) and Angiotensin IV (i.e. peptide VYIHPF) variants targeting the AT1R and vasodilatator AT4R, respectively.
32418532,From the known molecular functioning of the RAS, Angiotensins I and II (aside Angiotensin III) are playing central roles in the activity of RAS and associated pathologies, including COVID-19 [2, 10].
32418532,Interestingly, it appears that a 'counter-regulatory' RAS does exist to modulate system homeostasis; it relies on Angiotensin 1-7, Angiotensin 1-9, Alamandine, Angiotensin A, and Angiotensin IV, which are targeting the MasR, AT2R, MRGD, ACE2 and AT4R vasodilatator receptors, respectively.
32418532,These peptides were found to exhibit cardioprotective, vasoactive (anti-hypertensive), anti-hypertrophic and/or anti-inflammatory potentials [15].
32418532,Such naturally-produced molecules of the RAS are expected to counteract the SARS-CoV-2-induced over-activation of RAS and reverse, to some extent, the associated COVID-19 diseases.
32418532,CONCLUDING REMARKS A recent report suggests that RAS inhibitors may act on the severity of viral infection and mortality of COVID-19 patients [14].
32418532,Whether or not RAS blockers would be beneficial to COVID-19 cases is still controversial.
32418532,The RAS inhibitors likely prevent the cytokine storm as RAS is reported to control the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines [1, 7].
32418532,It appears that COVID-19 disorders of SARS-CoV-2-infected humans depend on the RAS over-reacted by the (ACE2-dependent) viral infection and vitamin D deficiency.
32418532,The track for a possible COVID-19 treatment would be to target RAS using specific candidate chemotherapeutic drugs.
32418532,The proposed molecules are (so far) ACE inhibitors (to prevent the production of Angiotensin II from Angiotensin I), and blockers/antagonists of AT1R such as Losartan and derivatives.
32418532,Recombinant ACE2 (under clinical trials) is also considered as a decoy for the recognition and competitive binding to the spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 [9, 10].
32418532,We support the use of natural candidate peptide drugs that belong to the 'counter-regulatory' RAS, i.e.
32418532,Angiotensin 1-7, Angiotensin 1-9, Alamandine, Angiotensin A and/or Angiotensin IV to treat COVID-19 disorders.
32418532,The targeted receptors would thus be MasR, AT2R, MRGD, ACE2 and AT4R.
32418532,The authors wish to thank Bonabes De Rougé MD for fruitful discussions.
32418728,Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have an optional prescription status that has resulted in frequent use, in particular for the symptomatic treatment of fever and non-rheumatic pain.
32418728,In 2019, a multi-source analysis of complementary pharmacological data showed that using NSAIDs in these indications (potentially indicative of an underlying infection) increases the risk of a severe bacterial complication, in particular in the case of lung infections.
32418728,First, the clinical observations of the French Pharmacovigilance Network showed that severe bacterial infections can occur even after a short NSAID treatment, and even if the NSAID is associated with an antibiotic.
32418728,Second, pharmacoepidemiological studies, some of which minimized the protopathic bias, all converged and confirmed the risk.
32418728,Third, experimental in vitro and in vivo animal studies suggest several biological mechanisms, which strengthens a causal link beyond the well-known risk of delaying the care of the infection (immunomodulatory effects, effects on Streptococcus pyogenes infections, and reduced antibiotics efficacy).
32418728,Therefore, in case of infection, symptomatic treatment with NSAIDs for non-severe symptoms (fever, pain, or myalgia) is not to be recommended, given a range of clinical and scientific arguments supporting an increased risk of severe bacterial complication.
32418728,Besides, the existence of a safer drug alternative, with paracetamol at recommended doses, makes this recommendation of precaution and common sense even more legitimate.
32418728,In 2020, such recommendation is more topical than ever with the emergence of COVID-19, especially since it results in fever, headaches, muscular pain, and cough, and is further complicated with pneumopathy, and given experimental data suggesting a link between ibuprofen and the level of expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2.
32418730,COVID-19 is an unprecedented challenge for physicians and scientists.
32418730,Several publicized drugs are being used with not much evidence of their efficacy such as hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin or lopinavir-ritonavir.
32418730,Yet, the cardiac safety of these drugs in COVID-19 deserves scrutiny as they are known to foster cardiac adverse ADRs, notably QTc interval prolongation on the electrocardiogram and its arrhythmogenic consequences.
32418730,Since March 27th, 2020, the French Pharmacovigilance Network directed all cardiac adverse drug reactions associated with &quot;off-label&quot; use of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and lopinavir-ritonavir in COVID-19 to the Nice Regional Center of Pharmacovigilance.
32418730,Each Regional Center of Pharmacovigilance first assessed causality of drugs.
32418730,We performed a specific analysis of these cardiac adverse drug reactions amidst an array of risk factors, reassessed the electrocardiograms and estimated their incidence in coronavirus disease 2019.
32418730,In one month, 120 reports of cardiac adverse drug reactions have been notified, 103 of which associated with hydroxychloroquine alone (86%), or associated with azithromycin (60%).
32418730,Their estimated incidence is 0.77% to 1.54% of all patients, notwithstanding strong underreporting.
32418730,Lopinavir-ritonavir came third with 17 reports (14%) and chloroquine fourth with 3 reports (2.5%).
32418730,There were 8 sudden, unexplained or aborted deaths (7%), 8 ventricular arrhythmias (7%), 90 reports of prolonged QTc (75%) most of them &quot;serious&quot; (64%), 48 of which proved ≥ 500ms, 20 reports of severe conduction disorders (17%) and 5 reports of other cardiac causes (4%).
32418730,Six reports derived from automedication. &quot;Off-label&quot; use of treatments in COVID-19 increases the risk of cardiac ADRs, some of them avoidable.
32418730,Even if these drugs are perceived as familiar, they are used in patients with added risk factors caused by infection.
32418730,Precautions should be taken to mitigate the risk, even if they will be proven efficacious.
32418773,Patients treated for malignancy are considered at risk of severe COVID-19.
32418773,This exceptional pandemic has affected countries on every level, particularly health systems which are experiencing saturation.
32418773,Like many countries, France is currently greatly exposed, and a complete reorganization of hospitals is ongoing.
32418773,We propose here adaptations of diagnostic procedures, therapies and care strategies for patients treated for digestive cancer during the COVID-19 epidemic.
32418773,French societies of gastroenterology and gastrointestinal (GI) oncology carried out this study to answer two main questions that have arisen (i) how can we limit high-risk situations for GI-cancer patients and (ii) how can we limit contact between patients and care centers to decrease patients' risk of contamination while continuing to treat their cancer.
32418773,All recommendations are graded as experts' agreement according to the level of evidence found in the literature until March 2020.
32418773,A proposal to adapt treatment strategies was made for the main GI oncology situations.
32418773,Considering the level of evidence and the heterogeneous progression of the COVID-19 epidemic, all proposals need to be considered by a multidisciplinary team and implemented with patient consent.
32418773,COVID-19 epidemic may significantly affect patients treated for digestive malignancies.
32418773,Healthcare teams need to consider adapting treatment sequences when feasible and according to the epidemic situation.
32418885,The pandemic of COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses a significant threat to global health.
32418885,Currently, no specific prophylactic and therapeutic treatment is available.
32418885,No evidence from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that a treatment may ameliorate the clinical outcome of patients with COVID-19 exists with the only exception of preliminary evidence from remdesivir trials.
32418885,Here, we present evidence from the literature and a compelling hypothesis on the potential immunomodulatory, iron chelating and anti-oxidant effects of iron chelators in the treatment of COVID-19 and its complications.
32418885,Interestingly, iron chelation has been shown in vitro to suppress endothelial inflammation in viral infection, which is the main pathophysiologic mechanism behind systemic organ involvement induced by SARS-CoV-2, by inhibiting IL-6 synthesis through decreasing NF-kB.
32418885,Iron chelators exhibit iron chelating, antiviral and immunomodulatory effects in vitro and in vivo, particularly against RNA viruses.
32418885,These agents could attenuate ARDS and help control SARS-CoV-2 via multiple mechanisms including: 1) inhibition of viral replication; 2) decrease of iron availability; 3) upregulation of B cells; 4) improvement of the neutralizing anti-viral antibody titer; 5) inhibition of endothelial inflammation and 6) prevention of pulmonary fibrosis and lung decline via reduction of pulmonary iron accumulation.
32418885,Both retrospective analyses of data in electronic health records, as well as proof of concept studies in humans and large RCTs are needed to fully elucidate the efficacy and safety of iron chelating agents in the therapeutic armamentarium of COVID-19, probably as an adjunctive treatment.
32418894,Recent global outbreak of the pandemic caused by coronavirus (COVID-19) emphasizes the urgent need for novel antiviral therapeutics.
32418894,It can be supplemented by utilization of efficient and validated drug discovery approaches such as drug repurposing/repositioning.
32418894,The well reported and clinically used anti-malarial aminoquinoline drugs (chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine) have shown potential to be repurposed to control the present pandemic by inhibition of COVID-19.
32418894,The review elaborates the mechanism of action, safety (side effects, adverse effects, toxicity) and details of clinical trials for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to benefit the clinicians, medicinal chemist, pharmacologist actively involved in controlling the pandemic and to provide therapeutics for the treatment of COVID-19 infection.
32418917,The COVID-19 pandemic is one of the greatest infectious challenges in recent history.
32418917,Presently, few treatment options exist and the availability of effective vaccines is at least one year away.
32418917,There is an urgent need to find currently available, effective therapies in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 infection.
32418917,In this review, we compare and contrast the use of intravenous immunoglobulin and hyperimmune globulin in the treatment of COVID-19 infection.
32419272,The pandemic outbreaks of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), spread all over the world in a short period of time.
32419272,Efficient identification of the infection by SARS-CoV-2 has been one of the most important tasks to facilitate all the following counter measurements in dealing with the infectious disease.
32419272,In Taiwan, a COVID-19 Open Science Platform adheres to the spirit of open science: sharing sources, data, and methods to promote progress in academic research while corroborating findings from various disciplines has established in mid-February 2020, for collaborative research in support of the development of detection methods, therapeutics, and a vaccine for COVID-19.
32419272,Research priorities include infection control, epidemiology, clinical characterization and management, detection methods (including viral RNA detection, viral antigen detection, and serum antibody detection), therapeutics (neutralizing antibody and small molecule drugs), vaccines, and SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.
32419272,In addition, research on social ethics and the law are included to take full account of the impact of the COVID-19 virus.
32419401,When an emergency-care patient is diagnosed with an emerging infectious disease, hospitals in Korea may temporarily close their emergency departments (EDs) to prevent nosocomial transmission.
32419401,Since February 2020, multiple, consecutive ED closures have occurred due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis in Daegu.
32419401,However, sudden ED closures are in contravention of laws for the provision of emergency medical care that enable the public to avail prompt, appropriate, and 24-hour emergency medical care.
32419401,Therefore, this study ascertained the vulnerability of the ED at tertiary hospitals in Daegu with regard to the current standards.
32419401,A revised triage and surveillance protocol has been proposed to tackle the current crisis.
32419401,This study was retrospectively conducted at 6 level 1 or 2 EDs in a metropolitan city where ED closure due to COVID-19 occurred from February 18 to March 26, 2020.
32419401,The present status of ED closure and patient characteristics and findings from chest radiography and laboratory investigations were assessed.
32419401,Based on the experience from repeated ED closures and the modified systems that are currently used in EDs, revised triage and surveillance protocols have been developed and proposed.
32419401,During the study period, 6 level 1 or 2 emergency rooms included in the study were shut down 27 times for 769 hours.
32419401,Thirty-one confirmed COVID-19 cases, of whom 7 died, were associated with the incidence of ED closure.
32419401,Typical patient presentation with respiratory symptoms of COVID-19 was seen in less than 50% of patients, whereas abnormal findings on chest imaging investigations were detected in 93.5% of the study population.
32419401,The chest radiography facility, resuscitation rooms, and triage area were moved to locations outside the ED, and a new surveillance protocol was applied to determine the factors warranting quarantine, including symptoms, chest radiographic findings, and exposure to a source of infection.
32419401,The incidence of ED closures decreased after the implementation of the revised triage and surveillance protocols.
32419401,Triage screening by emergency physicians and surveillance protocols with an externally located chest imaging facility were effective in the early isolation of COVID-19 patients.
32419401,In future outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases, efforts should be focused toward the provision of continued ED treatment with the implementation of revised triage and surveillance protocols.
32419524,<b>Introduction</b>: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has developed since December 2019.
32419524,It has caused a global pandemic with more than three hundred thousand case fatalities.
32419524,However, apart from supportive care by respirators, no standard medical therapy is validated.<b>Areas covered</b>: This paper presents old drugs with potential <i>in vitro</i> efficacy against SARS-CoV-2.
32419524,The <i>in vitro</i> database, adverse effects, and potential toxicities of these drugs are reviewed regarding their feasibility of clinical prescription for the treatment of patients with COVID-19.
32419524,To obtain convincing recommendations, we referred to opinions from the US National Institute of Health regarding drugs repurposed for COVID-19 therapy.<b>Expert opinion</b>: Although strong evidence of well-designed randomized controlled studies regarding COVID-19 therapy is presently lacking, remdesivir, teicoplanin, hydroxychloroquine (not in combination with azithromycin), and ivermectin might be effective antiviral drugs and are deemed promising candidates for controlling SARS-CoV-2.
32419524,In addition, tocilizumab might be considered as the supplementary treatment for COVID-19 patients with cytokine release syndrome.
32419524,In future, clinical trials regarding a combination of potentially effective drugs against SARS-CoV-2 need to be conducted to establish the optimal regimen for the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19.
32419544,Corona virus disease 2019 started in December 2019 as an outbreak of unexplained pneumonias in Wuhan, a city in Hubei province of China.
32419544,This illness emerged as an epidemic in China and later spread to almost all countries over the globe except Antarctica.
32419544,This is caused by a beta Corona virus, which is genetically similar to SARS virus.
32419544,The predominant mode of transmission is <i>via</i> droplet spread, when the infected person coughs, sneezes or talks the virus is released in the respiratory secretions.
32419544,As there are only a few cases of COVID 19 in neonates, there is no convincing evidence to support the possibility of vertical transmission.
32419544,Clinical presentation in neonates is nonspecific, commonly observed are temperature instability, respiratory distress, poor feeding, lethargy, vomiting and diarrhea.
32419544,Laboratory examinations may be nonspecific.
32419544,Definitive test for 2019-nCoV is the detection of viral nucleic acid by real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
32419544,Suspected and confirmed COVID positive mothers should be delivered in separate delivery rooms and operation theaters.
32419544,Since there is no approved treatment or drug for this disease, prevention of infection and breaking the chain of transmission plays a crucial role.
32419703,Contagious disease outbreaks and related restrictions can lead to negative psychological outcomes, particularly in vulnerable populations at risk due to pre-existing medical conditions.
32419703,No randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have tested interventions to reduce mental health consequences of contagious disease outbreaks.
32419703,The primary objective of the Scleroderma Patient-centered Intervention Network COVID-19 Home-isolation Activities Together (SPIN-CHAT) Trial is to evaluate the effect of a videoconference-based program on symptoms of anxiety.
32419703,Secondary objectives include evaluating effects on symptoms of depression, stress, loneliness, boredom, physical activity, and social interaction.
32419703,The SPIN-CHAT Trial is a pragmatic RCT that will be conducted using the SPIN-COVID-19 Cohort, a sub-cohort of the SPIN Cohort.
32419703,Eligible participants will be SPIN-COVID-19 Cohort participants without a positive COVID-19 test, with at least mild anxiety (PROMIS Anxiety 4a v1.0 T-score ≥ 55), not working from home, and not receiving current counselling or psychotherapy.
32419703,We will randomly assign 162 participants to intervention groups of 7 to 10 participants each or waitlist control.
32419703,We will use a partially nested RCT design to reflect dependence between individuals in training groups but not in the waitlist control.
32419703,The SPIN-CHAT Program includes activity engagement, education on strategies to support mental health, and mutual participant support.
32419703,Intervention participants will receive the 4-week (3 sessions per week) SPIN-CHAT Program via videoconference.
32419703,The primary outcome is PROMIS Anxiety 4a score immediately post-intervention.
32419703,The SPIN-CHAT Trial will test whether a brief videoconference-based intervention will improve mental health outcomes among at-risk individuals during contagious disease outbreak.
32419705,COVID-19 pandemic caused not only many deaths around the world but also made evident technical limitations of hospital and intensive care units (ICU).
32419705,The growing demand of ICU ventilators in a short lapse of time constitutes one of the main community concerns.
32419705,The main goal of this communication is to give simple solutions to transform a noninvasive ventilator in an invasive one for intubated patients.
32419705,The proposal can be applied in two well defined strategies for the COVID-19 pandemic: To replace anesthesia workstations, leaving those machines to be used in patients.
32419705,To apply this option in COVID-19 patients by way of a therapeutic &quot;bridge&quot;, waiting for the release of a ventilator in the ICU.
32419715,COVID-19 is a disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which was described in China in late 2019.
32419715,There are currently more than three million diagnosed cases, constituting a pandemic which has caused a worldwide crisis.
32419715,The devastating effects of this infection are due to its highly contagious nature and although mild forms predominate, in absolute values, the rates for severe forms and mortality are very high.
32419715,The information on the characteristics of the infection in inflammatory bowel disease is of special interest, as these patients have higher attendance at health centres, which may increase their risk of infection.
32419715,Furthermore, the treatments used to control the inflammatory activity may modify the disease course of COVID-19.
32419715,The Spanish Working Group on Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis (GETECCU) and the Spanish Nurses Working Group on Inflammatory Bowel Disease (GETEII) have prepared this document as a practical response to some common questions about the treatment of these patients.
32419721,The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic led to significant uncertainty among physicians and patients about the safety of immunosuppressive medications used for the management of dermatologic conditions.
32419721,We review available data on commonly used immunosuppressants and their effect on viral infections beyond COVID-19.
32419721,Notably, the effect of some immunosuppressants on viruses related to SARS-CoV2, including SARS and MERS, has been previously investigated.
32419721,In the absence of data on the effect of immunosuppressants on COVID-19, these data could be used to make clinical decisions on initiation and continuation of immunosuppressive medications during this pandemic.
32419721,In summary, we recommend considering the discontinuation of oral JAK inhibitors and prednisone, considering the delay of rituximab infusion, and the careful continuation of cyclosporine, mycophenolate, azathioprine, methotrexate, and biologics in patients currently benefitting from such treatments.
32419748,Knowledge related to SARS-CoV-2 or 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is still emerging and rapidly evolving.
32419748,We know little about the effects of this novel coronavirus on various body systems and its behaviour among patients with underlying neurological conditions, especially those on immunomodulatory medications.
32419748,The aim of the present consensus expert opinion document is to appraise the potential concerns when managing our patients with underlying CNS autoimmune demyelinating disorders during the current COVID-19 pandemic.
32419749,The ongoing pandemic of COVID-19 is a global public health emergency.
32419749,This has led to challenges for healthcare facilities to optimally manage other important medical emergencies.
32419749,Stroke is an important public health emergency with significant mortality and morbidity.
32419749,Timely treatment of acute stroke is critical to prevent disability.
32419749,The current expert consensus statement on behalf of the Indian Stroke Association outlines the issues and suggestions related to the management of stroke during this ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
32419750,The 2019 novel coronavirus (nCoV) pandemic is rapidly developing across the globe and new information is emerging expeditiously and constantly, particularly in relation to neurological illnesses.
32419750,Both central and peripheral nervous system involvement has been reported including headache, dizziness, hyposmia/anosmia, taste disturbances, seizures, stroke, alteration of the sensorium, and even acute hemorrhagic necrotizing leukoencephalopathy.
32419750,Varying degrees of olfactory disturbances may pre-empt the diagnosis of COVID-19.
32419750,Although no direct effect of 2019 nCoV has been reported yet on Parkinson's disease, there are enormous possible indirect effects and implications.
32419750,We examine the potential effects and challenges posed by this pandemic to individuals with Parkinson's disease, particularly in the Indian context where telecommunication access or support group access may be lacking for these patients.
32419750,Additionally, lockdown and social distancing may pose hurdles in the provision of optimum medical therapy, particularly if patients experience motor and non-motor deteriorations due to diverse reasons.
32419752,COVID-19 pandemic is an emerging, rapidly evolving situation.
32419752,Migraine is one of the commonest and highly disabling chronic neurological diseases in the world.
32419752,During the pandemic and lockdown, migraine patients are facing an enormous problem in getting optimum care because of difficulty in access, forced social isolation, and encountering a health system that is getting rapidly overwhelmed.
32419752,It is important that they must be protected by minimizing their visits to the clinics and emergency departments.
32419752,Paradoxically multiple triggers are in operation which is likely to increase their headache frequency.
32419752,Hence physicians should be made aware of the new rules of the game in treating migraines during this time of the pandemic so that these patients get optimum treatment and care and don't feel left out.
32419752,This review tries to answer a series of questions related to managing migraines in the times of COVID-19 pandemic.
32419767,Diabetic foot ulcers are among the most serious complications of diabetes.
32419767,If left untreated, these ulcers can lead to severe infection and gangrene; in some instances, they may result in death.
32419767,Thus, timely treatment of diabetic foot ulcers is extremely important.
32419767,However, timely patient treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic is particularly challenging, because of the higher volume of patients and the need to ensure safety of medical personnel.
32419767,This article describes a proposed strategy for diagnosis and treatment of diabetic foot ulcers, based on experiences with infection and control strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic in China.
32419838,The new human coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense RNA virus for which no specific drugs are currently available.
32419838,A knowledge-based analysis strongly suggests a possible repositioning of the anti-HCV direct antiviral agent (DAA) Sofosbuvir as treatment for SARS-CoV-2.
32419838,Indeed, the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerases (RdRp) of the two viruses show high sequence and structural homology, supporting the likelihood of binding the Sofosbuvir molecule with similar efficiency.
32419838,Such a repositioning would allow the containment of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and limit the progression of disease to potentially deadly COVID19.
32419840,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is profoundly affecting life around the globe.
32419840,Isolation, contact restrictions and economic shutdown impose a complete change to the psychosocial environment in affected countries.
32419840,These measures have the potential to threaten the mental health of children and adolescents significantly.
32419840,Even though the current crisis can bring with it opportunities for personal growth and family cohesion, disadvantages may outweigh these benefits.
32419840,Anxiety, lack of peer contact and reduced opportunities for stress regulation are main concerns.
32419840,Another main threat is an increased risk for parental mental illness, domestic violence and child maltreatment.
32419840,Especially for children and adolescents with special needs or disadvantages, such as disabilities, trauma experiences, already existing mental health problems, migrant background and low socioeconomic status, this may be a particularly challenging time.
32419840,To maintain regular and emergency child and adolescent psychiatric treatment during the pandemic is a major challenge but is necessary for limiting long-term consequences for the mental health of children and adolescents.
32419840,Urgent research questions comprise understanding the mental health effects of social distancing and economic pressure, identifying risk and resilience factors, and preventing long-term consequences, including-but not restricted to-child maltreatment.
32419840,The efficacy of telepsychiatry is another highly relevant issue is to evaluate the efficacy of telehealth and perfect its applications to child and adolescent psychiatry.
32419840,There are numerous mental health threats associated with the current pandemic and subsequent restrictions.
32419840,Child and adolescent psychiatrists must ensure continuity of care during all phases of the pandemic.
32419840,COVID-19-associated mental health risks will disproportionately hit children and adolescents who are already disadvantaged and marginalized.
32419840,Research is needed to assess the implications of policies enacted to contain the pandemic on mental health of children and adolescents, and to estimate the risk/benefit ratio of measures such as home schooling, in order to be better prepared for future developments.
32419879,These best practice recommendations for ENT consultations during the COVID-19 pandemic have been drawn up because ENT examinations and treatments are at risk of contamination by the SARS-Cov-2 virus in certain instances.
32419879,Thus, ENT specialists are among the professionals who are most exposed to this infection.
32419879,During the pandemic, insofar as an asymptomatic patient may be infected and contagious, the same precautions must be employed whether the patient be ill with, suspected of having, or without any clinical evidence of COVID-19 infection.
32419879,According to the scientific data available, the examinations and procedures potentially exposing to projections / aerosolizations of organic material of human origin are considered to be at risk of staff contamination.
32419879,For ENT examinations and procedures without exposure to such projections / aerosolizations, the professional is advised to a long sleeve clean outfit, a surgical mask and gloves in case of contact with the patient's mucosa.
32419879,ENT examinations and procedures with exposure to these projections / aerosolizations require the so-called &quot;airborne&quot;, &quot;contact&quot;, and &quot;droplets&quot; additional precautions: FFP2/N95 respiratory protection device, eye protection, disposable headwear and long sleeve overgown.
32419926,A novel coronavirus recently identified in Wuhan, China (SARS-CoV-2) has expanded the number of highly pathogenic coronaviruses affecting humans.
32419926,The SARS-CoV-2 represents a potential epidemic or pandemic threat, which requires a quick response for preparedness against this infection.
32419926,The present report uses the informational spectrum methodology to identify the possible origin and natural host of the new virus, as well as putative therapeutic and vaccine targets.
32419926,The performed <i>in silico</i> analysis indicates that the newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV and, to a lesser degree, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV.
32419926,Moreover, the well-known SARS-CoV receptor (ACE2) might be a putative receptor for the novel virus as well.
32419926,Actin protein was also suggested as a host factor that participates in cell entry and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2; therefore, drugs modulating biological activity of this protein (e.g. ibuprofen) were suggested as potential candidates for treatment of this viral infection.
32419926,Additional results indicated that civets and poultry are potential candidates for the natural reservoir of the SARS-CoV-2, and that domain 288-330 of S1 protein from the SARS-CoV-2 represents promising therapeutic and/or vaccine target.
32419998,The COVID-19 pandemic is affecting all aspects of the healthcare ecosystem, including administration of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).
32419998,The clinical and logistical challenges created by the COVID-19 public health crisis are clear, but the solutions to these issues are less readily apparent.
32419998,The goal of this work is to use our experience at a large, academic medical center as a lens for interpreting the many looming issues specific to radiosurgery and its role in the treatment of brain and spine disorders.
32419998,While the full impact of the pandemic remains to be seen, the aim of this paper is to provide a structural framework to optimize delivery of neurosurgically oriented radiosurgery with proposed clinical workflow strategies.
32419998,Innovative solutions to the current pandemic crisis affecting the healthcare ecosystem will be driven by increased interdisciplinary and global dialogue.
32420049,The COVID-19 disease is caused by a positive stranded RNA virus called SARS-CoV-2.
32420049,The virus mainly targets the pulmonary epithelial cells as it's initial site of infection by letting its surface spike protein interact and bind to the host ACE2 receptor.
32420049,The internalization and gradual replication of the virus results in an exaggerated immune response triggering release of many pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines.
32420049,This immune storm is responsible for multiple health hazards in the host ultimately leading to multiple organ failure.
32420049,Mesenchymal stem cell therapy offers a promising approach towards mitigating the delirious effects of the infection in the COVID-19 patients.
32420049,This therapy has shown to reduce the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as repair of damaged tissues in COVID-19 patients.
32420049,This review has been organized to put forward the positive aruments and implications in support of mesenchymal stem cell therapy as a necessary approach for treating COVID-19 patients.
32420073,Since December, 2019, a 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) infected by the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province, and the epidemic situation has continued to spread globally.
32420073,The epidemic spread of COVID-19 has brought great challenges to the clinical practice of thoracic oncology.
32420073,Outpatient clinics need to strengthen the differential diagnosis of initial symptoms, pulmonary ground-glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, interstitial and/or interlobular septal thickening, and crazy paving appearance.
32420073,In the routine of oncology, the differential diagnosis of adverse events from COVID-19 is also significant, including radiation pneumonitis, checkpoint inhibitor pneumonitis (CIP), neutropenic fever, and so on.
32420073,During the epidemic, indications of transbronchial biopsy (TBB) and CT-guided percutaneous thoracic biopsy are strictly controlled.
32420073,For patients who are planning to undergo biopsy operation, screening to exclude the possibility of COVID-19 should be carried out.
32420073,For confirmed or suspected patients, three-level protection should be performed during the operation.
32420073,Disinfection and isolation measures should be strictly carried out during the operation.
32420073,At last, more attention to the protection of cancer patients and give priority to the treatment of infected cancer patients.
32420305,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has become an immense public health burden, first in China and subsequently worldwide.
32420305,Developing effective control measures for COVID-19, especially measures that can halt the worsening of severe cases to a critical status is of urgent importance.
32420305,A 52-year-old woman presented with a high fever (38.8 °C), chills, dizziness, and weakness.
32420305,Epidemiologically, she had not been to Wuhan where COVID-19 emerged and did not have a family history of a disease cluster.
32420305,A blood test yielded a white blood cell count of 4.41 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L (60.6 ± 2.67% neutrophils and 30.4 ± 1.34% lymphocytes).
32420305,Chest imaging revealed bilateral ground-glass lung changes.
32420305,Based on a positive nasopharyngeal swab nucleic acid test result and clinical characteristics, the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19.
32420305,Following treatment with early non-invasive ventilation and a bundle pharmacotherapy, she recovered with a good outcome.
32420305,Early non-invasive ventilation with a bundle pharmacotherapy may be an effective treatment regimen for the broader population of patients with COVID-19.
32420523,Since the outbreak of COVID-19, no data have been available for hospitalised psychiatric patients who are suspected to have COVID-19.
32420523,We performed a comprehensive investigation of the clinical features of hospitalised patients with schizophrenia with or without suspected COVID-19 in Hubei Province, China.
32420523,To explore the clinical characteristics of hospitalised patients with schizophrenia with suspected COVID-19 in Hubei Province, China. 21 hospitalised patients with schizophrenia with suspected COVID-19 (COVID-19 suspected group) in the isolation ward of a mental health hospital in Wuhan and 30 hospitalised patients with schizophrenia (clean group) in the general ward of another mental health hospital in Yichang were recruited.
32420523,We retrospectively reviewed their clinical characteristics, laboratory findings and chest CT results before 21 February 2020.
32420523,We also compared the emotional and mental symptoms between the two groups.
32420523,Medical records revealed that 21 COVID-19 suspected patients were transferred to the isolation ward between 30 January 2020 and 15 February 2020.
32420523,The mean age (SD) of COVID-19 suspected patients was 43.1 (2.6).
32420523,12 (57.1%) patients showed abnormalities on chest CT before onset of respiratory symptoms.
32420523,14 (66.7%) patients had psychiatric medications adjustment after detection of abnormal chest CT findings.
32420523,By 21 February, one patient was confirmed to have COVID-19.
32420523,Even though the remaining 20 (95.2%) were negative for at least two reverse transcription PCR tests, 11 (52.4%) patients met the diagnostic criteria for clinically confirmed cases.
32420523,Compared with patients in the clean group, patients in the suspected COVID-19 group showed significantly higher stress, depression and anxiety levels and poorer sleep quality.
32420523,Setting up an independent isolation ward for hospitalised psychiatric patients who are suspected to have symptoms of COVID-19 helped control the spread of the epidemic.
32420523,Patients with schizophrenia suspected to have COVID-19 showed increased stress and mood and sleep disturbances, which should be appropriately managed.
32420607,A novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) broke out at 2019 and had caused a pandemic around the world.
32420607,This disease was found resulting from the infection of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) (Zhu, et al 2020).
32420607,The severity of COVID-19 disease has a wide range and varies from asymptomatic to critical severe, clinical researches reported that 10-15% of the patients were in the severe situation and required a great deal of attention of treatment and nursing (WHO-China-Joint-Mission 2020).
32420609,Since being identified in China in December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) has rapidly evolved into a global pandemic with over 4 million cases and more than 270,000 deaths.(
32420609,1) Following the first reported cases in the United Kingdom (UK) in late January 2020, numbers have continued to rise with 223,060 cases and 32,065 deaths reported as of 11<sup>th</sup> May 2020.(
32420609,2) Initial reports from China have indicated that Covid-19 has an overall mortality rate of 1.4%.
32420609,However, the prognosis varies widely between groups, with age over 60 years and underlying conditions including hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer identified as risk factors for severe disease and death.(
32420609,3) The initial reports from China show that patients with cancer are over-represented among individuals who develop severe Covid-19 after contracting the virus.(
32420609,4) Patients with haematological malignancies are expected to be at increased risk of adverse outcomes from this viral infection, due being immunosuppressed as a consequence of the underlying cancer, and from the effects of therapy.
32420631,The 2019 Coronavirus Pandemic challenges the delivery of care for patients with head and neck cancer.
32420631,An important aspect of this care has been the evolution of enhanced survivorship services, which include surveillance for recurring cancer and prevention of second primaries.
32420631,The application of evidence-based approaches to the identification and management of treatment and tumor-related toxicities has embraced the use of validated patient-reported outcomes instruments, health promotion, and care coordination.
32420631,In this manuscript, we describe how our multidisciplinary team of survivorship providers has accommodated to the need to provide patients with social distancing while acknowledging the importance of continued care during treatment and through the spectrum of survivorship.
32420637,Since its outbreak in late 2019, the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic already infected over 3.7 million people and claimed more than 250,000 lives globally.
32420637,At least 1 year may take for an approved vaccine to be in place, and meanwhile millions more could be infected, some with fatal outcome.
32420637,Over thousand clinical trials with COVID-19 patients are already listed in ClinicalTrials.com, some of them for assessing the utility of therapeutics approved for other conditions.
32420637,However, clinical trials take many months, and are typically done with small cohorts.
32420637,A much faster and by far more efficient method for rapidly identifying approved therapeutics that can be repurposed for treating COVID-19 patients is data mining their past and current electronic health and prescription records for identifying drugs that may protect infected individuals from severe COVID-19 symptoms.
32420637,Examples are discussed for applying health and prescription records for assessing the potential repurposing (repositioning) of angiotensin receptor blockers, estradiol, or antiandrogens for reducing COVID-19 morbidity and fatalities.
32420637,Data mining of prescription records of COVID-19 patients will not cancel the need for conducting controlled clinical trials, but could substantially assist in trial design, drug choice, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and prioritization.
32420637,This approach requires a strong commitment of health provides for open collaboration with the biomedical research community, as health provides are typically the sole owners of retrospective drug prescription records.
32420691,Passive immunity against pathogens in epidemics has historical roots.
32420691,Convalescent plasma (CP), plasma collected from individuals who have recovered from an infectious disease, has been used to confer therapeutic benefits in previous epidemics, including measles, mumps, and influenza, and remains the first line passive immunotherapy in emerging diseases, including the H1N1 influenza pandemic (2009) and now Covid-19 (1).
32420691,Over the last several decades, as technology has developed to purify and manufacture plasma-derived immunoglobulin (IG) as a drug therapy, hyperimmune globulin (H-IG) formulations have been used as the second line of passive immunotherapies against these diseases.
32420705,COVID-19 is a treacherous disease, in which infected patients who appear to fare well can deteriorate rapidly, mostly due to respiratory failure.
32420705,For general practitioners (and other first-line responders), a clinical evaluation at any given time merely provides a snapshot of the patient's condition.
32420705,Therefore, frequent monitoring is warranted in at-risk patients.
32420705,However, there is no one-size-fits-all approach for monitoring, treatment and referral decisions.
32420705,This is particularly the case in patients with advanced age.
32420705,In this article, through the use of case examples, we aim to provide guidance when facing difficult management decisions in patients with (suspected) COVID-19.
32420710,Since the first reported case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19) in Poland, the worldwide pandemic has spread throughout the country, leading to many hospital admissions.
32420710,There has been an urgent need to determine clinical characteristics of Polish patients with laboratory‑confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV 2) infection in the clinical setting.
32420710,The aim of this retrospective study was to outline characteristics and short‑ term outcomes of SARS‑CoV‑2-positive patients.
32420710,We retrospectively assessed 169 consecutive patients with laboratory‑ confirmed COVID‑ 19 with regard to their clinical manifestations, radiological findings, treatment, complications, and outcomes.
32420710,Of the 169 patients, more than half was aged 65 years or older (88; 52.1%), 51.5% were male, and 78.3% had comorbidities.
32420710,The majority of patients (106; 62.7%) were transferred from outbreak locations in medical facilities.
32420710,The most common symptoms on admission were fever (42%), shortness of breath (35%), and fatigue (33%).
32420710,Twenty seven (15.4%) patients required intensive care unit admission.
32420710,Overall mortality was 26.3% (n = 46) and was significantly higher in patients transferred from other facilities (38 out of 106; 35.8%), than in patients admitted directly to the hospital (8 out of 63; 12.69%; P &lt;0.001).
32420710,Seventeen out of 29 patients admitted to the intensive care unit died (mortality, 58.6%), including 30 out of 41 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (73.2% mortality rate).
32420710,Polish patients with COVID‑19 have similar characteristics and risk factors for adverse outcomes to those observed in countries in which outbreaks occurred earlier.
32420710,Significantly higher mortality in patients transferred from other centers warrants special attention and transfer policy should be verified.
32420751,Since the outbreak of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hubei province, the epidemic scale has increased rapidly, and no effective antiviral drug therapy has been identified yet.
32420751,This study aimed to evaluate the adjuvant efficacy of Natural Herbal Medicine (NHM) combined with Western medicine in the treatment of COVID-19.
32420751,We performed a retrospective, 1:1 matched, case-control study of the first cohort of hospitalized COVID-19-confirmed cases (January 17, 2020 to January 28, 2020).
32420751,A total of 22 of the 36 confirmed patients were included in this study, split into two groups of 11: the NHM group (NHM combined standard Western medicine treatment) and control group (standard Western medicine treatment alone).
32420751,All patients received appropriate supportive care and regular clinical and laboratory monitoring.
32420751,Main evaluation indicators included improvement of clinical symptoms such as fever, cough and diarrhea after hospitalization; pathogen nucleic acid test result of respiratory tract and fecal specimens of the patient after hospitalization, and change of chest CT examination after hospitalization.
32420751,The duration of fever in the NHM group (<mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mml:mn>3</mml:mn> <mml:mo>.</mml:mo> <mml:mn>4</mml:mn> <mml:mo>±</mml:mo> <mml:mn>2</mml:mn> <mml:mo>.</mml:mo> <mml:mn>4</mml:mn> </mml:math> days) was significantly shorter than that in the control group (<mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mml:mn>5</mml:mn> <mml:mo>.</mml:mo> <mml:mn>6</mml:mn> <mml:mo>±</mml:mo> <mml:mn>2</mml:mn> <mml:mo>.</mml:mo> <mml:mn>2</mml:mn> </mml:math> days) (<mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mml:mi>p</mml:mi> <mml:mo>=</mml:mo> <mml:mn>0</mml:mn> <mml:mo>.</mml:mo> <mml:mn>0</mml:mn> <mml:mn>3</mml:mn> </mml:math>).
32420751,During the whole hospitalization period, the number of cases with diarrhea in the NHM group (two cases) was less than that in the control group (eight cases) (<mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mml:mi>p</mml:mi> <mml:mo>=</mml:mo> <mml:mn>0</mml:mn> <mml:mo>.</mml:mo> <mml:mn>0</mml:mn> <mml:mn>3</mml:mn> </mml:math>).
32420751,Compared with the control group (<mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mml:mn>7</mml:mn> <mml:mo>.</mml:mo> <mml:mn>5</mml:mn> <mml:mo>±</mml:mo> <mml:mn>1</mml:mn> <mml:mo>.</mml:mo> <mml:mn>6</mml:mn> </mml:math>), the duration for improvement (DI) of chest CT in the NHM group (<mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mml:mn>5</mml:mn> <mml:mo>.</mml:mo> <mml:mn>6</mml:mn> <mml:mo>±</mml:mo> <mml:mn>2</mml:mn> <mml:mo>.</mml:mo> <mml:mn>3</mml:mn> </mml:math>) was significantly shorter (<mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mml:mi>p</mml:mi> <mml:mo>=</mml:mo> <mml:mn>0</mml:mn> <mml:mo>.</mml:mo> <mml:mn>0</mml:mn> <mml:mn>4</mml:mn> </mml:math>).
32420751,Our results suggest that NHM could improve the clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients and may be effective in treating COVID-19; thus, a larger, prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial should be conducted to further evaluate the adjuvant efficacy of NHM in the treatment of COVID-19.
32420777,<b>Introduction:</b> With the emergence of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in many countries, medical resources currently focus on the treatment of confirmed patients and screening of suspected cases.
32420777,Asymptomatic patients may be contagious, which makes epidemic control difficult.
32420777,We describe an asymptomatic patient with a positive real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test in urine.<b>Case report:</b> An asymptomatic girl was identified during the epidemiological investigation of a confirmed COVID-19 patient.
32420777,When admitted to the hospital on 24 February 2020, she had no clinical manifestations.
32420777,A throat swab was negative for RT-PCR, but urine was positive.
32420777,She was given antiviral and symptomatic supportive treatment.
32420777,On 26 February, a throat swab RT-PCR was positive.
32420777,RT-PCR in throat swabs and urine were negative on 3 and 5 March, and on 9 and 12 March, throat swabs were still negative.
32420777,At follow-up on 26 March, she felt well, throat swab RT-PCR was negative, and isolation was lifted.<b>Conclusion:</b> The urine of asymptomatic patients may be contagious.
32420777,RT-PCR in urine might be a useful supplement in screening when the RT-PCR is negative in throat swabs.
32420788,Since late December 2019, an outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease, which is mainly characterized by pulmonary lesions, has spread quickly worldwide.
32420788,With the spread of the novel coronavirus, the outpatient lines of hospitals have mostly shut down, which means that routine clinical diagnosis and treatment for autoimmune bullous diseases patients have been disturbed.
32420788,Due to the serious condition of autoimmune bullous diseases patients, they are prone to immune suppression and circulatory failure, and are more susceptible to infection than healthy individuals.
32420788,These patients should thus be a priority group for novel coronavirus disease prevention.
32420788,In this context, the protection and control measures for autoimmune bullous diseases patients against the novel coronavirus are of serious concern.
32420788,Clinicians should strengthen their communication with patients, pay attention to changes in patients' conditions, and carefully adjust the treatment strategy, while protecting against the novel coronavirus infection, to ensure the continuity, safety, and effectiveness of autoimmune bullous diseases treatment.
32420913,The Covid 19 pandemic we are currently facing all over the world is undoubtly an emergency condition which exposes all workers to the risks of a serious infection.
32420913,The personnel working in the autoptic room is at high risk for the possible contact with infected material from corpses, splashes and aerosols diffusion, and must be always prepared to stay safe and healthy.
32420913,We offer to the forensic odontologists' community a short summary of some old and new hints on the treatment of dead bodies in the autopsy room during this pandemic emergency time.
32420927,The global context we are experiencing, characterized by the pandemic spread of SARS-CoV2, imposes strict containment, isolation and physical distance measures, necessary to control and contain the risk of contagion.
32420927,Despite social distances and isolation in this context of threat to Global Health, the sharing of experiences, professionalism, scientific research and Public Health strategies is fundamental.
32420927,Never before has telemedicine played a decisive role in supporting the healthcare organization, The University Hospital Consortium Policlinico of Bari has launched an experimental partnership project with West China Hospital of Sichuan University through periodic and scheduled video conferences.
32420927,The Company Strategic Management, the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine and Surgery of the University of Bari, Medical Executives of the Health Department, of the U.O of Infectious Diseases, Anesthesia and Resuscitation, Pulmonology, Emergency, Hygiene, Occupational Medicine, Psychiatry and Doctors Resident operating in the COVID Area. are involved in the Experimental Project., all adequately trained and instructed on the operating protocol.
32420927,From the preliminary data of this study, it appears that the Bari Polyclinic has adopted the same therapeutic strategies started in China in the previous months, believing early diagnosis and treatment to be a strength in the battle against COVID-19.
32420927,The project makes it possible to make the management of COVID-19 patients optimal, safe and better, using the experience acquired in the field by Chinese doctors who, first caught by this health emergency, have obtained positive results.
32420936,The Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) outbreak has been recognized as a global threat to public health.
32420936,It is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and no effective therapies currently exist against this novel viral agent.
32420936,Along with extensive public health measures, an unprecedented global effort in identifying effective drugs for the treatment is being implemented.
32420936,Potential drug targets are emerging as the result of a fast-evolving understanding of SARS-CoV-2 virology, host response to the infection, and clinical course of the disease.
32420936,This brief review focuses on the latest and most promising pharmacological treatments against COVID-19 currently under investigation and discuss their potential use based on either documented efficacy in similar viral infections, or their activity against inflammatory syndromes.
32420936,Ongoing clinical trials are also emphasized.
32420939,Covid-19 infection is a multisystem disease more frequent in older individuals, especially in those with multiple chronic diseases.
32420939,This multimorbid and frail population requires attention and a personalized comprehensive assessment in order to avoid the occurrence of adverse outcomes.
32420939,As other diseases, the COVID-19 presentation in older patients is often atypical with less severe and unspecific symptoms.
32420939,These subjects both at home and during hospitalization suffer isolation and the lack of support of caregivers.
32420939,The geriatric care in COVID-19 wards is often missing.
32420939,The application of additional instruments would be necessary to facilitate and personalize the clinical approach, not only based on diseases but also on functional status.
32420939,This narrative review starts from diagnostic evaluation, continues with adapted pharmacologic treatment and ends with the recovery phase targeting the nutrition and physical exercise.
32420939,We developed a check-list of respiratory, gastro-intestinal and other less-specific symptoms, summarized in a table and easily to be filled-up by patients, nurses and general practitioners.
32420939,As second step, we reported the clinical phases of this disease.
32420939,Far to be considered just viral infective and respiratory, this disease is also an inflammatory and thrombotic condition with frequent bacterial over-infection.
32420939,We finally considered timing and selection of treatment, which depend on the disease phase, co-administration of other drugs and require the monitoring of renal, liver and cardiac function.
32420939,This underlines the role of age not just as a limitation, but also an opportunity to increase the quality and the appropriateness of multidisciplinary and multidimensional intervention in this population.
32420944,Summar y.
32420944,The beginning of 2020 has seen the emergence of COVID-19, an outbreak caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, an important pathogen for humans.
32420944,SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus containing 29891 nucleotides encoding 9889 amino acids.
32420944,The genome is arranged as 5p-replicase (orf1/ab)-structural proteins [Spike (S) -Envelope (E) - Membrane (M) -Nucleocapsid (N)] -3.
32420944,Viruses are obligate intracellular infectious agents that use the host cellular machinery to ensure their own fitness and survival.
32420944,MicroRNAs (miRNA9) systems are potent post-transcriptional gene expression regulators that are important modulators of viral infections, and could play an important role in the treatment of viral infections.
32420944,This review focuses to the genomic structure of coronaviruses, the functions of genomic proteins, the effects of micro RNA (miRNA) on virus replication and its pathogenesis.
32420958,Sofosbuvir may be a potential option in the treatment of COVID-19 based on the similarity between the replication mechanisms of the HCV and the coronavirus.
32420958,According the limited experimental evidences, it is hypothesized that sofosbuvir might be a potential option to improve care of patients with COVID-19 especially at the start of the disease and before invasion of the virus into the lung parenchymal cells.
32420958,Efficacy and safety of sofosbuvir in treatment of COVID-19 may be considered in future clinical studies.
32421258,To investigate the ocular manifestations and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients caused by SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan, China.
32421258,A total of 535 COVID-19 patients were recruited at Mobile Cabin Hospital and Tongji Hospital.
32421258,Information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, ocular symptoms, eye drop medication, eye protections, chronic eye diseases, systemic concomitant symptoms, radiologic findings and SARS-CoV-2 detection in nasopharyngeal swabs by real-time PCR was collected from questionnaires and electronic medical records.
32421258,Of 535 patients, 27 patients (5.0%) presented with conjunctival congestion and 4 patients had conjunctival congestion as the initial symptom.
32421258,The average duration of conjunctival congestion was 5.9 ± 4.5 days (mean [SD]).
32421258,The other ocular symptoms, including increased conjunctival secretion, ocular pain, photophobia, dry eye and tearing, were also found in patients with conjunctival congestion.
32421258,Notably, hand-eye contact was independently correlated with conjunctival congestion in COVID-19 patients.
32421258,We also found that some COVID-19 patients had chronic eye diseases, including conjunctivitis (33, 6.2%), xerophthalmia (24, 4.5%) and keratitis (14, 2.6%).
32421258,Similar to the published studies, the most common clinical symptoms were fever, cough and fatigue.
32421258,A total of 343 patients (64.1%) had positive SARS-CoV-2 detection in nasopharyngeal swabs.
32421258,Conjunctival congestion is one of the COVID-19-related ocular symptoms, which could occur as the initial symptoms.
32421258,Frequent hand-eye contact may be the risk factor for conjunctival congestion in COVID-19 patients.
32421258,Screening of patients with conjunctival congestion by ophthalmologists is advocated during the outbreak of COVID-19.
32421258,It is essential to provide eye-care equipment and strengthen education on eye protection.
32421292,The goal of this column is to help mental health care professionals understand coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) so that they can better explain the complexities of the current crisis to their patients.
32421292,The bottom-line of this column is that, while COVID-19 can infect virtually everyone in the human population, only about 5% are susceptible to severe infection requiring admission to an intensive care unit and/or causing a fatal outcome and this population can be identified on the basis of comorbid medical illness and/or age.
32421292,These numbers are based on experience in China, the United States, and Europe.
32421292,Table 1 presents an analysis conducted by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which is further supported by several other sources reviewed in the article.
32421292,The population at risk for severe infection are individuals with comorbid medical illness and those 85 years of age and older.
32421292,The comorbid medical illnesses identified as risk factors are preexisting respiratory and cardiovascular disease, immunocompromised status, morbid obesity (ie, body mass index ≥40), diabetes mellitus, and possibly significant kidney or liver impairment.
32421292,Parenthetically, news reports and the literature sometimes cite age 60 years and older as a risk factor but age between 60 and 85 years is likely a surrogate for having 1 or more of these comorbid medical conditions.
32421292,While 5% may initially seem like a small number, it nevertheless potentially represents 16.5 million people, given the United States population of 330 million.
32421292,That is a tremendous number of people requiring intensive care unit admission and/or potentially dying, and individuals in this population have overwhelmed the US health care system in some hotspots.
32421292,For this reason, this column suggests taking this at-risk population into account in mitigation strategies when attempting to open the US economy.
32421292,The column addresses the following questions: (1) What are the 3 aspects of the race to minimize the damage caused by COVID-19?
32421292,(2) What data are currently available to help guide decisions to be made?
32421292,(3) What strategies have been employed to date and how successful have they been?
32421292,and (4) Might risk stratification of exposure be a viable strategy to minimize the damage caused by the virus?
32421292,The race to minimize the damage caused by COVID-19 requires that we obtain knowledge about the disease and its treatment or prevention, how to best safeguard public health and avoid overwhelming the health care system, and how to minimize the societal damage caused by substantial disruption of the economy.
32421292,Data gathered over the past 4 months since the COVID-19 virus emerged as a human pathogen have provided guidance for our decisions going forward.
32421292,The most widely adopted strategies for dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic to date have involved the epidemiological approach of encouraging good hygiene practices and social distancing, including orders to &quot;shelter in place,&quot; quarantine of high-risk individuals, and isolation of infected individuals.
32421292,The goal of this epidemiological approach has been to &quot;flatten the curve&quot; by reducing the height of the peak of the infection to avoid overwhelming the health care system and society in general, while buying time to learn more about the disease and find more effective ways to deal with it.
32421292,However, now that more is known about COVID-19 and the portion of the population that is most at risk for serious adverse outcomes including death, it may be possible to move from a shelter-in-place approach for the entire population to focus on those at most risk and thus facilitate a gradual and rational phased reduction of social restrictions to reopen the economy.
32421292,Such a graduated opening would be based on regions of countries meeting specific criteria in terms of being able to contain the virus, coupled with vigorous monitoring to look for outbreaks, followed by case monitoring, isolation of infected individuals and quarantine of exposed individuals, and increased use of testing for active disease as well as for immunity.
32421292,Taking the data on high-risk individuals into account would allow for a gradual lifting of restrictions on the majority of the population while maintaining more stringent safeguards to protect the vulnerable portion of the population.
32421292,Nevertheless, the entire population would need to continue to practice good hygiene and social distancing while simultaneously-and perhaps even more vigorously-focusing on sheltering the vulnerable population until adequate community immunity has been achieved to prevent the spread of the virus, whether that is accomplished through natural exposure alone or with the addition of safe and effective vaccine(s) which may not be available for a year.
32421292,Continued widespread testing for antibodies will help determine how far or close this country is-and other countries are-from developing effective community immunity.
32421381,<b>Background:</b> To investigate deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we performed a single institutional study to evaluate its prevalence, risk factors, prognosis, and potential thromboprophylaxis strategies in a large referral and treatment center. <b>Methods:</b> We studied a total of 143 patients with COVID-19 from January 29 to February 29, 2020.
32421381,Demographic and clinical data, laboratory data, including ultrasound scans of the lower extremities, and outcome variables were obtained, comparisons were made between DVT and non-DVT groups. <b>Results:</b> Of the 143 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (aged 63 ± 14 years; 74 [51.7%] man), 66 patients developed lower extremity DVT (46.1%, included 23 [34.8%] with proximal DVT and 43 [65.2%] with distal DVT).
32421381,Compared with patients who with no DVT, patients with DVT were older and had a lower oxygenation index, a higher rate of cardiac injury, and worse prognosis including an increased proportion of deaths (23 [34.8%] vs 9 [11.7%], <i>P</i> = 0.001) and a decreased proportion of patients discharged (32 [48.5%] vs 60 [77.9%], <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001).
32421381,Multivariant analysis only showed an association between CURB-65 score 3-5 (OR = 6.122, <i>P</i> = 0.031), Padua prediction score ≥ 4 (OR = 4.016, <i>P</i> = 0.04), and D-dimer &gt;1.0 (μg/ml) (OR = 5.818, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.014) and DVT in this cohort, respectively.
32421381,The combination of a CURB-65 score 3-5, a Padua prediction score ≥ 4, and D-dimer &gt; 1.0 (μg/ml) has a sensitivity of 88.52% and a specificity of 61.43% for screening for DVT.
32421381,In the subgroup of patients with a Padua prediction score ≥ 4 and whose ultrasound scans were performed ˃72 hours after admission, DVT was present in 18 (34.0%) of the subgroup receiving venous thromboembolism prophylaxis vs 35 (63.3%) in the nonprophylaxis group (<i>P</i> = 0.010). <b>Conclusions:</b> The prevalence of DVT is high and is associated with adverse outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.
32421381,Prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism may be protective in patients with a Padua protection score ≥ 4 after admission.
32421381,Our data seem to suggest that COVID-19 is probably an additional risk factor for DVT in the hospitalized patients.
32421539,Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) often have clinical characteristics, such as chest tightness and dyspnea.
32421539,Continuous, unresolved dyspnea often indicates the progression of lung lesions.
32421539,The mechanism that underlies the chest distress and dyspnea in patients with COVID-19 is still unclear.
32421539,Chest CT has a higher sensitivity and can play an essential role in the diagnosis and treatment of the disease.
32421539,However, our clinical observations showed that although some patients had significant chest distress and dyspnea, the lesions that were observed in the lungs during computed tomography were milder and not completely consistent with clinical symptoms.
32421539,We analyzed the clinical characteristics, laboratory test results, and imaging findings of these patients.
32421539,We found that extensive inflammation of the bilateral and respiratory bronchioles in patients with COVID-19 due to excessive activation of proinflammatory cytokines and chemotactic aggregation of T-lymphocytes at the site of inflammation are possible mechanisms underlying chest distress and dyspnea in patients with COVID-19.
32421539,Short-time and lose-dose use of corticosteroid may be helpful to treat chest tightness and dyspnea in mild COVID-19 patients.
32421539,Through this study, we aimed to improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of COVID-19.
32421541,The COVID-19, the disease caused by a novel coronavirus and named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread rapidly across the globe.
32421541,It has caused outbreaks of illness due to person-to-person transmission of the virus mainly via close contacts and droplets produced by an infected person's cough or sneeze.
32421541,Exhaled droplets from infected patients with COVID-19 can be inhaled into the lungs and leads to respiratory illness such as pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
32421541,Although aerosol therapy is a mainstay procedure used to treat pulmonary diseases at home and healthcare settings, it has a potential for fugitive emissions during therapy due to the generation of aerosols and droplets as a source of respiratory pathogens.
32421541,Delivering aerosolized medications to patients with COVID-19 can aggravate the spread of the novel coronavirus.
32421541,This has been a real concern for caregivers and healthcare professionals who are susceptible to unintended inhalation of fugitive emissions during therapy.
32421541,Due to a scarcity of information in this area of clinical practice, the purpose of this paper is to explain how to deliver aerosolized medications to mild-, sub-intensive, and intensive-care patients with COVID-19 and how to protect staff from exposure to exhaled droplets during aerosol therapy.
32421627,COVID-19 pandemic outbreak is the most astounding scene ever experienced in the XXI century.
32421627,In this opinionated review, we underscore the crucial role of biosensing to handle with such situations.
32421627,As a matter of fact, testing accelerates life-saving decisions on treatment and isolation of COVID-19 patients in an early stage, and thereby, decelerating or even preventing the spread of such emerging infectious diseases.
32421627,Meanwhile, it is also proven that a timely and broad application of testing leads to lower mortality rates in countries like Germany or South Korea.
32421627,Besides, biosensors are also powerful tools for effective assessment of clinical progress and to provide alertness on severity or critical trends of infection.
32421627,In view hereof, we critically discuss the state-of-the-art biosensing devices for COVID-19 testing.
32421627,We spot the urgent needs and highlight innovative diagnostic approaches for targeting various COVID-19 related biomarkers.
32421627,Finally, we outline our recommendations on biosensors and biosensing-related issues towards pandemic outbreaks.
32421686,The coronavirus pandemic outbreak is considered the most daunting public health challenge in decades.
32421686,With no effective treatments and the time needed to develop a vaccine, alternatives approaches are followed to control such pandemic.
32421686,To identify topics, opinions, and recommendations discussed by medical professionals about the coronavirus pandemic outbreak on social medial platform, Twitter.
32421686,Using a mixed-method approach blending the capabilities of social media analytics and qualitative analysis, we analyzed coronavirus related tweets posted by medical professionals and examined their content.
32421686,We used qualitative analysis to explore the collected data in order to identify relevant tweets and uncover important concepts about the phenomenon using qualitative coding.
32421686,Unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques and text analysis were used to identify topics and opinions.
32421686,Data was collected from 119 medical professionals on Twitter about the coronavirus pandemic.
32421686,A total of 10,096 English tweets were collected from the identified medical professionals between December 1, 2019 and April 1, 2020.
32421686,We identified eight topics, namely, actions and recommendations, fighting misinformation, information and knowledge, healthcare system, symptoms and illness, immunity, testing, and infection and transmission.
32421686,Tweets were mainly focused on actions and recommendations (28%) needed to control the pandemic.
32421686,Many tweets warned about misleading information (20%) which could lead to more cases infected with the virus.
32421686,Other tweets discussed general Knowledge and information (9%) about the virus as well as concerns about the healthcare systems and workers (9%).
32421686,The remaining tweets discussed information about symptoms associated with COVID-19 (8%), immunity (7%), testing (6%), and virus infection and transmission (5%).
32421686,Findings indicate that Twitter and social media platforms could help identify important and useful knowledge shared by medical professionals during the pandemic outbreak.
32422062,The role of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) in COVID-19 disease susceptibility, severity, and treatment is unclear.
32422062,To evaluate, on an ongoing basis, whether use of ACEIs or ARBs either increases risk for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection or is associated with worse COVID-19 disease outcomes, and to assess the efficacy of these medications for COVID-19 treatment.
32422062,MEDLINE (Ovid) and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from 2003 to 4 May 2020, with planned ongoing surveillance for 1 year; the World Health Organization database of COVID-19 publications and medRxiv.org through 17 April 2020; and ClinicalTrials.gov to 24 April 2020, with planned ongoing surveillance.
32422062,Observational studies and trials in adults that examined associations and effects of ACEIs or ARBs on risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease severity and mortality.
32422062,Single-reviewer abstraction confirmed by another reviewer, independent evaluation by 2 reviewers of study quality, and collective assessment of certainty of evidence.
32422062,Two retrospective cohort studies found that ACEI and ARB use was not associated with a higher likelihood of receiving a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result, and 1 case-control study found no association with COVID-19 illness in a large community (moderate-certainty evidence).
32422062,Fourteen observational studies, involving a total of 23 565 adults with COVID-19, showed consistent evidence that neither medication was associated with more severe COVID-19 illness (high-certainty evidence).
32422062,Four registered randomized trials plan to evaluate ACEIs and ARBs for treatment of COVID-19.
32422062,Half the studies were small and did not adjust for important confounding variables.
32422062,High-certainty evidence suggests that ACEI or ARB use is not associated with more severe COVID-19 disease, and moderate-certainty evidence suggests no association between use of these medications and positive SARS-CoV-2 test results among symptomatic patients.
32422062,Whether these medications increase the risk for mild or asymptomatic disease or are beneficial in COVID-19 treatment remains uncertain.
32422062,None.
32422062,(PROSPERO: registration number pending).
32422076,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly become pandemic, with substantial mortality.
32422076,To evaluate the pathologic changes of organ systems and the clinicopathologic basis for severe and fatal outcomes.
32422076,Prospective autopsy study.
32422076,Single pathology department. 11 deceased patients with COVID-19 (10 of whom were selected at random for autopsy).
32422076,Systematic macroscopic, histopathologic, and viral analysis (SARS-CoV-2 on real-time polymerase chain reaction assay), with correlation of pathologic and clinical features, including comorbidities, comedication, and laboratory values.
32422076,Patients' age ranged from 66 to 91 years (mean, 80.5 years; 8 men, 3 women).
32422076,Ten of the 11 patients received prophylactic anticoagulant therapy; venous thromboembolism was not clinically suspected antemortem in any of the patients.
32422076,Both lungs showed various stages of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), including edema, hyaline membranes, and proliferation of pneumocytes and fibroblasts.
32422076,Thrombosis of small and mid-sized pulmonary arteries was found in various degrees in all 11 patients and was associated with infarction in 8 patients and bronchopneumonia in 6 patients.
32422076,Kupffer cell proliferation was seen in all patients, and chronic hepatic congestion in 8 patients.
32422076,Other changes in the liver included hepatic steatosis, portal fibrosis, lymphocytic infiltrates and ductular proliferation, lobular cholestasis, and acute liver cell necrosis, together with central vein thrombosis.
32422076,Additional frequent findings included renal proximal tubular injury, focal pancreatitis, adrenocortical hyperplasia, and lymphocyte depletion of spleen and lymph nodes.
32422076,Viral RNA was detectable in pharyngeal, bronchial, and colonic mucosa but not bile.
32422076,The sample was small.
32422076,COVID-19 predominantly involves the lungs, causing DAD and leading to acute respiratory insufficiency.
32422076,Death may be caused by the thrombosis observed in segmental and subsegmental pulmonary arterial vessels despite the use of prophylactic anticoagulation.
32422076,Studies are needed to further understand the thrombotic complications of COVID-19, together with the roles for strict thrombosis prophylaxis, laboratory, and imaging studies and early anticoagulant therapy for suspected pulmonary arterial thrombosis or thromboembolism.
32422076,None.
32422146,SARS-CoV-2 has dramatically changed our world, country, communities and families.
32422146,There is controversy regarding risk factors for severe COVID-19 disease.
32422146,It has been suggested that asthma and allergy are not highly represented as co-morbid conditions associated with COVID-19.
32422146,To extend our work in interleukin (IL)-13 biology to determine if airway epithelial cell expression of two key mediators critical for SARS-CoV-2 infection, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) are modulated by IL-13.
32422146,We determined effects of IL-13 treatment on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression ex vivo in primary airway epithelial cells from participants with and without type 2 asthma obtained by bronchoscopy.
32422146,We also examined expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in two datasets containing gene expression data from nasal and airway epithelial cells from children and adults with asthma and allergic rhinitis.
32422146,IL-13 significantly reduced ACE2 and increased TMPRSS2 expression ex vivo in airway epithelial cells.
32422146,In two independent datasets, ACE2 expression was significantly reduced and TMPRSS2 was significantly increased in the nasal and airway epithelial cells in type 2 asthma and allergic rhinitis.
32422146,ACE2 expression was significantly negatively associated with type 2 cytokines while TMPRSS2 expression was significantly positively associated with type 2 cytokines.
32422146,IL-13 modulates ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in airway epithelial cells in asthma.
32422146,This deserves further study with regard to any effects asthma and atopy may render in the setting of COVID-19 infection.
32422178,In December, 2019, reports emerged from Wuhan, China, of a severe acute respiratory disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32422178,By the end of April, 2020, over 3 million people had been confirmed infected, with over 1 million in the USA alone, and over 215 000 deaths.
32422178,The symptoms associated with COVID-19 are diverse, ranging from mild upper respiratory tract symptoms to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome.
32422178,The major risk factors for severe COVID-19 are shared with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), namely increasing age, male sex, and comorbidities such as hypertension and diabetes.
32422178,However, the role of antifibrotic therapy in patients with IPF who contract SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the scientific rationale for their continuation or cessation, is poorly defined.
32422178,Furthermore, several licensed and potential antifibrotic compounds have been assessed in models of acute lung injury and viral pneumonia.
32422178,Data from previous coronavirus infections such as severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome, as well as emerging data from the COVID-19 pandemic, suggest there could be substantial fibrotic consequences following SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32422178,Antifibrotic therapies that are available or in development could have value in preventing severe COVID-19 in patients with IPF, have the potential to treat severe COVID-19 in patients without IPF, and might have a role in preventing fibrosis after SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32422287,We herein report a rare case of the ruptured popliteal artery aneurysm in an 89-year-old man, whose recovery after surgical treatment was complicated with acute respiratory distress syndrome secondary to confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2.
32422287,Presenting symptoms, patient's comorbidities, and postoperative course complicated with cardiac and respiratory failure leading to adverse outcome are discussed in this case report.
32422288,The aim of this report is to discuss emergent repair for complex aortic diseases in patients affected by novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19), describing a case of ruptured pararenal aortic aneurysm.
32422288,A COVID-19, eighty-years-old man was admitted for ruptured aneurysm of the pararenal aorta and hemorrhagic shock.
32422288,Endovascular repair was chosen and a proximal extension of the previous abdominal endograft was performed with parallel stents in the right renal artery and the superior mesenteric artery.
32422288,Endovascular treatment and early anticoagulation are the key for success for vascular emergencies in COVID-19 patients, despite the risk of late endoleak.
32422305,COVID-19 pandemic has a high mortality rate and is affecting practically the entire world population.
32422305,The leading cause of death is severe acute respiratory syndrome as a consequence of exacerbated inflammatory response accompanied by uncontrolled oxidative stress as well as the inflammatory reaction at the lung level.
32422305,Until now, there is not a specific and definitive treatment for this pathology that worries the world population, especially the older adults who constitute the main risk group.
32422305,In this context, it results in a particular interest in the evaluation of the efficacy of existing pharmacological agents that may be used for overcoming or attenuating the severity of this pulmonary complication that has ended the lives of many people worldwide.
32422305,Vitamin D and melatonin could be good options for achieving this aim, taking into account that they have many shared underlying mechanisms that are able to modulate and control the immune adequately and oxidative response against COVID-19 infection, possibly even through a synergistic interaction.
32422305,The renin-angiotensin system exaltation with consequent inflammatory response has a leading role in the physiopathology of COVID-19 infection; and it may be down-regulated by vitamin D and melatonin in many organs.
32422305,Therefore, it is also essential to analyze this potential therapeutic association and their relation with RAS as part of this new approach.
32422331,Despite the panic and chaos that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has generated in over 200 countries, the role of neurosurgeons has never been more relevant and challenging.
32422331,The health system in Nepal was never geared to face an onslaught of an infectious disease.
32422331,At Kathmandu Medical College Teaching Hospital, we designated a separate complex for housing COVID-19 suspects to prevent the unaffected from getting exposed.
32422331,In a few hospitals, existing neurosurgical and medical intensive care units have been converted to isolation intensive care units.
32422331,A separate roster of doctors, nurses, and allied staff has been drafted to care for these patients to avoid contamination and allow effective quarantine of the staff involved in care.
32422331,At the directive of the government, all neurosurgical centers postponed routine cases and some have closed their outpatient departments because of the lack of protective gear.
32422331,All neurosurgical centers have seen drastic reductions in cases.
32422331,In these challenging times, we neurosurgeons, who are naturally primed and trained to respond and take on challenges in difficult situations, have the ideal opportunity to shine and make a true difference during this pandemic and beyond and be &quot;5-star doctors.&quot;
32422349,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) predisposes patients to a prothrombotic state with demonstrated microvascular involvement.
32422349,The degree of hypercoagulability appears to correlate with outcomes, however optimal criteria to assess for the highest risk patients for thrombotic events remain unclear; we hypothesized that deranged thromboelastography (TEG) measurements of coagulation would correlate with thromboembolic events.
32422349,Patients admitted to an intensive care unit with COVID-19 diagnoses that had TEG analyses performed were studied.
32422349,Conventional coagulation assays, D-dimer levels, and viscoelastic parameters were analyzed using a receiver operating characteristic curve to predict thromboembolic outcomes and new onset renal failure.
32422349,Forty-four patients with COVID-19 were included in the analysis.
32422349,Derangements in coagulation laboratory values including elevated D-Dimer, fibrinogen, PT, and PTT were confirmed; viscoelastic parameters showed an elevated maximum amplitude and low lysis at 30 minutes.
32422349,A complete lack of lysis of clot at 30 minutes was seen in 57% of patients and predicted VTE with an AUROC of .742 (p=0.021).
32422349,A D-Dimer cutoff of 2600 ng/ml predicted need for dialysis with an AUROC of .779 (p=0.005).
32422349,Overall, patients with no lysis of clot at 30 minutes and a D-Dimer of greater than 2600 ng/ml had a rate of VTE of 50% compared to 0% for patients with neither risk factor (p=0.008) and had a hemodialysis rate of 80% compared to 14% (p=0.004).
32422349,Fibrinolysis shutdown, as evidenced by elevated D-Dimer and complete failure of clot lysis at 30 minutes on thromboelastography, predicts thromboembolic events and need for hemodialysis in critically ill patients with COVID-19.
32422349,Further clinical trials are required to ascertain the need for early therapeutic anticoagulation or fibrinolytic therapy to address this state of fibrinolysis shutdown.
32422364,The global coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic continues to escalate at a rapid pace inundating medical facilities and creating substantial challenges globally.
32422364,The risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in patients with cancer seems to be higher, especially as they are more likely to present with an immunocompromised condition, either from cancer itself or from the treatments they receive.
32422364,A major consideration in the delivery of cancer care during the pandemic is to balance the risk of patient exposure and infection with the need to provide effective cancer treatment.
32422364,Many aspects of the SARS-CoV-2 infection currently remain poorly characterized and even less is known about the course of infection in the context of a patient with cancer.
32422364,As SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious, the risk of infection directly affects the cancer patient being treated, other cancer patients in close proximity, and health care providers.
32422364,Infection at any level for patients or providers can cause considerable disruption to even the most effective treatment plans.
32422364,Lung cancer patients, especially those with reduced lung function and cardiopulmonary comorbidities are more likely to have increased risk and mortality from coronavirus disease 2019 as one of its common manifestations is as an acute respiratory illness.
32422364,The purpose of this manuscript is to present a practical multidisciplinary and international overview to assist in treatment for lung cancer patients during this pandemic, with the caveat that evidence is lacking in many areas.
32422364,It is expected that firmer recommendations can be developed as more evidence becomes available.
32422376,We report the first successful treatment with the IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra, in association with the most promising and available antiviral therapy, of a severe case of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32422376,We describe the diagnosis, clinical course, and management of the case, including the respiratory failure at presentation, the progression to a scenario characterized by profound inflammatory dysregulation similar to that observed during macrophage activation syndrome, and the clinical improvement after treatment with the IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra.
32422376,This case highlights the high tolerability and the interesting immunomodulatory profile of the IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra in the setting of severe COVID-19 associated with remdesivir therapy.
32422376,Further studies are needed to confirm the safety and efficacy of this combination strategy in the treatment of this emerging infection.
32422384,Since December 2019, more than 3 million cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and about 200,000 deaths have been reported worldwide.
32422384,The outbreak of this novel disease has become a global health emergency and continues to rapidly spread around the world.
32422384,Based on the clinical data, approved cases are divided into four classes including mild, moderate, severe, and critical.
32422384,About 5% of cases were considered critically ill and 14% were considered to have the severe classification of the disease.
32422384,In China, the fatality rate of this infection was about 4%.
32422384,This review focuses on currently available information on the etiology, clinical symptoms, diagnosis, and mechanism of action of COVID-19.
32422384,Furthermore, we present an overview of diagnostic approaches and treatment of this disease according to available findings.
32422384,This review paper will help the physician to diagnose and successfully treat COVID-19.
32422426,Anosmia and hypogeusia, the inability or decreased ability to smell and taste, have been reported as common complaints in SARS-CoV-2 patients who were still in an asymptomatic phase.
32422426,These impairments affect the ability to sense odors in foods and the environment, obviously affecting quality of life, related to social interactions and general well-being.
32422426,The British Association of Otorhinolaryngology (ENT-UK) considers loss of sense of smell in their list of COVID-19's markers of infection.
32422426,Here we present two cases in which early manifestations of anosmia and hypogeusia were experienced with psycho-sensorial and atmospheric phenomena.
32422426,Psychiatrists, neurologists and physicians in general should be aware of this symptom presentation in order to avoid mistreatment, given that persistent olfactory dysfunction might increase the risks of nutritional deficit and lead to development of adjustment disorders.
32422426,All clinicians should be aware that the presentation of SARS-CoV-2's symptoms goes far beyond respiratory and sensorial dimensions and involves psychosensorial and neurological dimensions; these clinical observations could shed light on the neurobiological substrates involved in COVID-19 disease.
32422645,SARS-CoV-2 is a newly emerged coronavirus responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic that has resulted in more than 3.7 million infections and 260,000 deaths as of 6 May 2020<sup>1,2</sup>.
32422645,Vaccine and therapeutic discovery efforts are paramount to curb the pandemic spread of this zoonotic virus.
32422645,The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein promotes entry into host cells and is the main target of neutralizing antibodies.
32422645,Here we describe multiple monoclonal antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 S identified from memory B cells of an individual who was infected with SARS-CoV in 2003.
32422645,One antibody, named S309, potently neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV pseudoviruses as well as authentic SARS-CoV-2 by engaging the S receptor-binding domain.
32422645,Using cryo-electron microscopy and binding assays, we show that S309 recognizes a glycan-containing epitope that is conserved within the sarbecovirus subgenus, without competing with receptor attachment.
32422645,Antibody cocktails including S309 along with other antibodies identified here further enhanced SARS-CoV-2 neutralization and may limit the emergence of neutralization-escape mutants.
32422645,These results pave the way for using S309- and S309-containing antibody cocktails for prophylaxis in individuals at high risk of exposure or as a post-exposure therapy to limit or treat severe disease.
32422662,Data about optimal initial assessment in patients with suspicion for COVID19-infection or already confirmed infection are sparse.
32422662,Especially, in preparation for expected mass casualty incident it is necessary to distinguish early and efficiently between outpatient and inpatient treatment including the need for intensive care therapy.
32422662,We present a model for a safe and efficient triage, which is established and used in the university hospital of Essen, Germany.
32422662,It is intended for a non-disaster situation.
32422662,This model is a combination of clinical assessment by using vital parameters and Manchester triage scale (MTS).
32422662,Possible additional parameters are POCT (point-of-care-testing) values, electrocardiogram, CT pulmonary angiography, SARS-Cov2-PCR as well as detailed diagnostic of laboratory values.
32422662,The model was validated by 100 consecutive patients.
32422662,We demonstrate three patients to illustrate this model.
32422662,During the first two weeks after implementing this model in our normal operation at the emergency department, we had an efficient selectivity between need for inpatient and outpatient treatment. 16 patients were classified as &quot;inpatients&quot; according to initial assessment.
32422662,Among 84 patients who were initially classified as &quot;outpatients&quot;, 7 patients returned to our emergency department within 14 days.
32422662,Three of these patients returned due to complaints other than COVID19.
32422662,One female patient had to be admitted due to progressive dyspnea.
32422662,This introduced triage-model seems to be an efficient concept.
32422662,Adjustment might be necessary after further experience and after a growing number of patients.
32422662,Wenig ist bisher bekannt über die optimale Ersteinschätzung fußläufiger Patienten mit Verdacht auf COVID-19-Infektion oder bereits bestätigter Infektion.
32422662,Insbesondere der zu erwartende Massenanfall von Erkrankten verlangt nach einer raschen, effizienten und sicheren Unterscheidung zwischen ambulanter Therapieführung, stationärer Überwachung und ggf.
32422662,Intensivtherapie.
32422662,Wir präsentieren das in der Universitätsmedizin Essen (UME) entwickelte und verwendete Modell einer möglichst sicheren und effizienten Triage außerhalb des Katastrophenfalls.
32422662,Das beschriebene Modell der UME ist eine Kombination aus klinischer Einschätzung durch Vitalparameter und Manchester-Triage-Skala (MTS), optional ergänzt durch POCT-Labor, EKG, CT-Pulmonalisangiografie, SARS-CoV-2-PCR sowie ausführlichere Labordiagnostik.
32422662,Es erfolgte eine Validierung anhand von 100 konsekutiven Patienten. 3 konkrete Patientenbeispiele verdeutlichen das Modell.
32422662,Im Rahmen des Regelbetriebs ergab sich in den ersten 2 Wochen eine gute Trennschärfe zwischen stationär behandlungsbedürftigen und ambulanten Patienten.
32422662,16 Patienten wurden primär stationär aufgenommen.
32422662,Bei den 84 initial „ambulant“ klassifizierten Patienten kam es zu 7 Wiedervorstellungen binnen 14 Tagen, 3 hiervon aus anderen Gründen.
32422662,Eine Patientin musste hierbei aufgrund von progredienter Dyspnoe stationär aufgenommen werden.
32422662,Das vorgestellte Triage-Modell bewährt sich in der Praxis, wobei weitere Anpassungen je nach Erfahrung und Patientenanfall vorgesehen sind.
32422983,The current outbreak of COVID-19 infection, which started in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, in December 2019, is an ongoing challenge and a significant threat to public health requiring surveillance, prompt diagnosis, and research efforts to understand a new, emergent, and unknown pathogen and to develop effective therapies.
32422983,Despite the increasing number of published studies on COVID-19, in all the examined studies the lack of a well-defined pathophysiology of death among patients who died following COVID-19 infection is evident.
32422983,Autopsy should be considered mandatory to define the exact cause of death, thus providing useful clinical and epidemiologic information as well as pathophysiological insights to further provide therapeutic tools.
32422983,A literature review was performed on PubMed database, using the key terms: &quot;COVID-19&quot;, &quot;nCov 19&quot;, and &quot;Sars Cov 2&quot;. 9709 articles were retrieved; by excluding all duplicated articles, additional criteria were then applied: articles or abstracts in English and articles containing one of the following words: &quot;death&quot;, &quot;died&quot;, &quot;comorbidity&quot;, &quot;cause of death&quot;, &quot;biopsy&quot;, &quot;autopsy&quot;, or &quot;pathological&quot;.
32422983,A total of 50 articles met the inclusion criteria.
32422983,However, only 7 of these studies reported autopsy-based data.
32422983,The analysis of the main data from the selected studies concerns the complete analysis of 12,954 patients, of whom 2269 died (with a mortality rate of 17.52%).
32422983,Laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 infection was obtained in all cases and comorbidities were fully reported in 46 studies.
32422983,The most common comorbidities were: cardiovascular diseases (hypertension and coronary artery disease), metabolic disorders (diabetes, overweight, or obesity), respiratory disorders (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), and cancer.
32422983,The most common reported complications were: acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute kidney injury, cardiac injury, liver insufficiency, and septic shock.
32422983,Only 7 papers reported histological investigations.
32422983,Nevertheless, only two complete autopsies are described and the cause of death was listed as COVID-19 in only one of them.
32422983,The lack of postmortem investigation did not allow a definition of the exact cause of death to determine the pathways of this infection.
32422983,Based on the few histopathological findings reported in the analyzed studies, it seems to be a clear alteration of the coagulation system: frequently prothrombotic activity with consequent thromboembolism was described in COVID-19 patients.
32422983,As a scientific community, we are called on to face this global threat, and to defeat it with all the available tools necessary.
32422983,Despite the improvement and reinforcement of any method of study in every field of medicine and science, encouraging the autopsy practice as a tool of investigation could also therefore, help physicians to define an effective treatment to reduce mortality.
32423024,On 11 March 2020, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was defined by the World Health Organization as a pandemic.
32423024,Severe acute respiratory syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the newly evolving human coronavirus infection that causes COVID-19, and it first appeared in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and spread rapidly all over the world.
32423024,COVID-19 is being increasingly investigated through virology, epidemiology, and clinical management strategies.
32423024,There is currently no established consensus on the standard of care in the pharmacological treatment of COVID-19 patients.
32423024,However, certain medications suggested for other diseases have been shown to be potentially effective for treating this infection, though there has yet to be clear evidence.
32423024,Therapies include new agents that are currently tested in several clinical trials, in addition to other medications that have been repurposed as antiviral and immune-modulating therapies.
32423024,Previous high-morbidity human coronavirus epidemics such as the 2003 SARS-CoV and the 2012 Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) prompted the identification of compounds that could theoretically be active against the emerging coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
32423024,Moreover, advances in molecular biology techniques and computational analysis have allowed for the better recognition of the virus structure and the quicker screening of chemical libraries to suggest potential therapies.
32423024,This review aims to summarize rationalized pharmacotherapy considerations in COVID-19 patients in order to serve as a tool for health care professionals at the forefront of clinical care during this pandemic.
32423024,All the reviewed therapies require either additional drug development or randomized large-scale clinical trials to be justified for clinical use.
32423027,Finding efficacious and safe treatments for COVID-19 emerges as a crucial need in order to control the spread of the pandemic.
32423027,Whereas plasma therapy attracts much interest, the European project Discovery focuses on the potentialities of small molecules like remdesivir, the combination of lopinavir/ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine, and chloroquine.
32423027,Results recently published on the clinical evaluation of those drugs are compiled in this brief report, although complete data are still impatiently awaited.
32423059,As the outbreak of the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection is spreading globally, great effort is being made to understand the disease pathogenesis and host factors that predispose to disease progression in an attempt to find a window of opportunity for intervention.
32423059,In addition to the direct cytopathic effect of the virus, the host hyper-inflammatory response has emerged as a key factor in determining disease severity and mortality.
32423059,Accumulating clinical observations raised hypotheses to explain why some patients develop more severe disease while others only manifest mild or no symptoms.
32423059,So far, Covid-19 management remains mainly supportive.
32423059,However, many researches are underway to clarify the role of antiviral and immunomodulating drugs in changing morbidity and mortality in patients who become severely ill.
32423059,This review summarizes the current state of knowledge on the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and the host immune system and discusses recent findings on proposed pharmacologic treatments.
32423094,In December 2019, a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) from a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was recognized in the city of Wuhan, China.
32423094,Rapidly, it became an epidemic in China and has now spread throughout the world reaching pandemic proportions.
32423094,High mortality rates characterize SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19), which mainly affects the elderly, causing unrestrained cytokines-storm and subsequent pulmonary shutdown, also suspected micro thromboembolism events.
32423094,At the present time, no specific and dedicated treatments, nor approved vaccines, are available, though very promising data come from the use of anti-inflammatory, anti-malaria, and anti-coagulant drugs.
32423094,In addition, it seems that males are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 than females, with males 65% more likely to die from the infection than females.
32423094,Data from the World Health Organization (WHO) and Chinese scientists show that of all cases about 1.7% of women who contract the virus will die compared with 2.8% of men, and data from Hong Kong hospitals state that 32% of male and 15% of female COVID-19 patients required intensive care or died.
32423094,On the other hand, the long-term fallout of coronavirus may be worse for women than for men due to social and psychosocial reasons.
32423094,Regardless of sex- or gender-biased data obtained from WHO and those gathered from sometimes controversial scientific journals, some central points should be considered.
32423094,Firstly, SARS-CoV-2 has a strong interaction with the human ACE2 receptor, which plays an essential role in cell entry together with transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2); it is interesting to note that the <i>ACE2</i> gene lays on the X-chromosome, thus allowing females to be potentially heterozygous and differently assorted compared to men who are definitely hemizygous.
32423094,Secondly, the higher <i>ACE2</i> expression rate in females, though controversial, might ascribe them the worst prognosis, in contrast with worldwide epidemiological data.
32423094,Finally, several genes involved in inflammation are located on the X-chromosome, which also contains high number of immune-related genes responsible for innate and adaptive immune responses to infection.
32423094,Other genes, out from the RAS-pathway, might directly or indirectly impact on the ACE1/ACE2 balance by influencing its main actors (e.g., <i>ABO</i> locus, <i>SRY</i>, <i>SOX3, ADAM17</i>).
32423094,Unexpectedly, the higher levels of ACE2 or ACE1/ACE2 rebalancing might improve the outcome of COVID-19 in both sexes by reducing inflammation, thrombosis, and death.
32423094,Moreover, X-heterozygous females might also activate a mosaic advantage and show more pronounced sex-related differences resulting in a sex dimorphism, further favoring them in counteracting the progression of the SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32423150,The global outbreak of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has uncovered the fragility of healthcare and public health preparedness and planning against epidemics/pandemics.
32423150,In addition to the medical practice for treatment and immunization, it is vital to have a thorough understanding of community spread phenomena as related research reports 17.9-30.8% confirmed cases to remain asymptomatic.
32423150,Therefore, an effective assessment strategy is vital to maximize tested population in a short amount of time.
32423150,This article proposes an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven mobilization strategy for mobile assessment agents for epidemics/pandemics.
32423150,To this end, a self-organizing feature map (SOFM) is trained by using data acquired from past mobile crowdsensing (MCS) campaigns to model mobility patterns of individuals in multiple districts of a city so to maximize the assessed population with minimum agents in the shortest possible time.
32423150,Through simulation results for a real street map on a mobile crowdsensing simulator and considering the worst case analysis, it is shown that on the 15th day following the first confirmed case in the city under the risk of community spread, AI-enabled mobilization of assessment centers can reduce the unassessed population size down to one fourth of the unassessed population under the case when assessment agents are randomly deployed over the entire city.
32423250,The global coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has highlighted the importance of understanding the cardiovascular implications of coronavirus infections, with more severe disease in those with cardiovascular co-morbidities, and resulting cardiac manifestations such as myocardial injury, arrhythmias, and heart failure.
32423250,A systematic review of the current knowledge on the effects of coronavirus infection on the cardiovascular system in humans was performed and results were summarized.
32423250,Databases such as MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, Scopus, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, Chinese Knowledge Resource Integrated Database and Chinese Clinical Trial Registry were searched on 20 March 2020.
32423250,In total, 135 studies were included, involving severe acute respiratory syndrome, Middle East respiratory syndrome, coronavirus disease 2019 and other coronaviruses.
32423250,Most were case reports, case series and cohort studies of poor to fair quality.
32423250,In post-mortem examinations of subjects who died from infection, around half had virus identified in heart tissues in severe acute respiratory syndrome, but none in Middle East respiratory syndrome and coronavirus disease 2019.
32423250,Cardiac manifestations reported include tachycardia, bradycardia, arrhythmias, and myocardial injury, secondary to both systemic infection and treatment.
32423250,Cardiac injury and arrhythmias are more prevalent in coronavirus disease 2019, and elevated cardiac markers are associated with intensive care unit admission and death.
32423250,In severe acute respiratory syndrome, Middle East respiratory syndrome, and coronavirus disease 2019, comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and heart disease are associated with intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation, and mortality.
32423250,There were cases of misdiagnosis due to overlapping presentations of cardiovascular diseases and coronavirus infections, leading to hospital spread and delayed management of life-threatening conditions.
32423250,This review highlighted the ways in which coronaviruses affect cardiovascular function and interacts with pre-existing cardiovascular diseases.
32423297,Contemporary medical practice is grounded in rigorous scientific evidence in concert with best clinical practices and informed shared decision making with patients.
32423297,During these times of uncertainty, disruption, and even anxiety, it becomes critical that we engage with our patients and communities in thoughtful dialogue and realistic expectations regarding treatments surrounding COVID-19.
32423297,The hope for a &quot;miracle&quot; cure and urgency to return back to normal times can stimulate irrational thought and behavior and even desperate measures by individuals or groups.
32423297,It becomes especially important that we continue to use reasonable, informed clinical judgment in discussing the various options with patients.
32423298,Otolaryngology and head and neck surgery underwent drastic changes during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32423298,Since March 10, the first day of the lockdown in Italy, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures were limited to emergency and oncology cases, while outpatient procedures and clinical examinations were temporarily suspended to limit virus diffusion and to reallocate personnel into wards dedicated to COVID-19.
32423298,In our otolaryngology unit, between March 10 and April 28, 2020, we performed 96 surgical procedures; they mainly consisted in diagnosis and treatment of malignant tumors of the head and neck (77%), management of acute upper airway obstruction in adults and children (14.7%), drainage of abscesses of the head and neck (6.2%), and treatment of nasal bone fractures (2.1%).
32423298,When comparing these data with those of the same period in 2019 for emergency and oncology procedures, we noticed a drastic reduction of head and neck abscesses and nasal bone fractures, while oncology surgery remained stable.
32423324,Outbreak of the new type coronavirus infection, known as coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19), has begun in December 2019, in Wuhan, China.
32423324,As of today, 3 April 2020, 972,640 people affected and 50,325 people died from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus 2.
32423324,There is not any standard treatment for coronavirus infection 2019; however, there are promising data for hydroxychloroquine and some anti-retroviral drugs.
32423324,Programmed death-1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand-1 (PDL-1) pathway is an important target for the cancer immunotherapy.
32423324,However, there is a robust pre-clinical and clinical data regarding inhibitor effect of this pathway on the acute or chronic viral infections.
32423324,Thus, blockade of this pathway may lead to an anti-viral effect and decrease viral load.
32423324,Here, we report the clinical course of coronavirus infection 2019 infection of a patient in whom older aged, having multiple co-morbidities, and taking nivolumab for metastatic malignant melanoma.
32423324,In contrast to her older age, comorbidities, and cancer diagnosis, she was in a good condition, and there was also no pneumonia finding.
32423324,We think that this good clinical course of coronavirus infection 2019 infection may be related to blockade of PD-1/PDL-1 pathway with nivolumab.
32423324,It is impossible to say that blockade of PD-1/PDL-1pathway is a treatment option for COVID-19; however, we want to share our experience.
32423449,In late 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, capital city of Hubei province in China.
32423449,Cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection quickly grew by several thousand per day.
32423449,Less than 100 days later, the World Health Organization declared that the rapidly spreading viral outbreak had become a global pandemic.
32423449,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is typically associated with fever and respiratory symptoms.
32423449,It often progresses to severe respiratory distress and multi-organ failure which carry a high mortality rate.
32423449,Older patients or those with medical comorbidities are at greater risk for severe disease.
32423449,Inflammation, pulmonary edema and an over-reactive immune response can lead to hypoxia, respiratory distress and lung damage.
32423449,Mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) possess potent and broad-ranging immunomodulatory activities.
32423449,Multiple in vivo studies in animal models and ex vivo human lung models have demonstrated the MSC's impressive capacity to inhibit lung damage, reduce inflammation, dampen immune responses and aid with alveolar fluid clearance.
32423449,Additionally, MSCs produce molecules that are antimicrobial and reduce pain.
32423449,Upon administration by the intravenous route, the cells travel directly to the lungs where the majority are sequestered, a great benefit for the treatment of pulmonary disease.
32423449,The in vivo safety of local and intravenous administration of MSCs has been demonstrated in multiple human clinical trials, including studies of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
32423449,Recently, the application of MSCs in the context of ongoing COVID-19 disease and other viral respiratory illnesses has demonstrated reduced patient mortality and, in some cases, improved long-term pulmonary function.
32423449,Adipose-derived stem cells (ASC), an abundant type of MSC, are proposed as a therapeutic option for the treatment of COVID-19 in order to reduce morbidity and mortality.
32423449,Additionally, when proven to be safe and effective, ASC treatments may reduce the demand on critical hospital resources.
32423449,The ongoing COVID-19 outbreak has resulted in significant healthcare and socioeconomic burdens across the globe.
32423449,There is a desperate need for safe and effective treatments.
32423449,Cellular based therapies hold great promise for the treatment of COVID-19.
32423449,This literature summary reviews the scientific rationale and need for clinical studies of adipose-derived stem cells and other types of mesenchymal stem cells in the treatment of patients who suffer with COVID-19.
32423553,Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and its homologue, ACE2, have been mostly associated with hypertensive disorder.
32423553,However, recent pandemia of SARS-CoV-2 has put these proteins at the center of attention, as this virus has been shown to exploit ACE2 protein to enter cells.
32423553,Clear difference in the response of affected patients to this virus has urged researchers to find the molecular basis and pathophysiology of the cell response to this virus.
32423553,Different levels of expression and function of ACE proteins, underlying disorders, consumption of certain medications and the existence of certain genomic variants within ACE genes are possible explanations for the observed difference in the response of individuals to the SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32423553,In the current review, we discuss the putative mechanisms for this observation.
32423584,No specific antiviral drug has been proven effective for treatment of patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32423584,Remdesivir (GS-5734), a nucleoside analogue prodrug, has inhibitory effects on pathogenic animal and human coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in vitro, and inhibits Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, SARS-CoV-1, and SARS-CoV-2 replication in animal models.
32423584,We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial at ten hospitals in Hubei, China.
32423584,Eligible patients were adults (aged ≥18 years) admitted to hospital with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, with an interval from symptom onset to enrolment of 12 days or less, oxygen saturation of 94% or less on room air or a ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen of 300 mm Hg or less, and radiologically confirmed pneumonia.
32423584,Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to intravenous remdesivir (200 mg on day 1 followed by 100 mg on days 2-10 in single daily infusions) or the same volume of placebo infusions for 10 days.
32423584,Patients were permitted concomitant use of lopinavir-ritonavir, interferons, and corticosteroids.
32423584,The primary endpoint was time to clinical improvement up to day 28, defined as the time (in days) from randomisation to the point of a decline of two levels on a six-point ordinal scale of clinical status (from 1=discharged to 6=death) or discharged alive from hospital, whichever came first.
32423584,Primary analysis was done in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population and safety analysis was done in all patients who started their assigned treatment.
32423584,This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04257656.
32423584,Between Feb 6, 2020, and March 12, 2020, 237 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to a treatment group (158 to remdesivir and 79 to placebo); one patient in the placebo group who withdrew after randomisation was not included in the ITT population.
32423584,Remdesivir use was not associated with a difference in time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio 1·23 [95% CI 0·87-1·75]).
32423584,Although not statistically significant, patients receiving remdesivir had a numerically faster time to clinical improvement than those receiving placebo among patients with symptom duration of 10 days or less (hazard ratio 1·52 [0·95-2·43]).
32423584,Adverse events were reported in 102 (66%) of 155 remdesivir recipients versus 50 (64%) of 78 placebo recipients.
32423584,Remdesivir was stopped early because of adverse events in 18 (12%) patients versus four (5%) patients who stopped placebo early.
32423584,In this study of adult patients admitted to hospital for severe COVID-19, remdesivir was not associated with statistically significant clinical benefits.
32423584,However, the numerical reduction in time to clinical improvement in those treated earlier requires confirmation in larger studies.

32423664,To analyze the potential mechanism of cardiovascular dysfunctions induced by Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to evaluate more effective therapeutic pathways for patients with cardiovascular diseases.
32423664,COVID-19 mainly invades the lungs, causing its serious damage.
32423664,Studies found that COVID-19 induced the renin-angiotensin system imbalance, inflammatory storm, hypoxemia, stress response, and so on; all contributed to hypertension and serious myocardial damage in the process of virus pathogenesis, even increasing mortality in COVID-19 patients.
32423664,In the process of management of COVID-19 infections, close attention should be paid on both lung and cardiovascular damage, especially on those with only symptoms of cardiovascular diseases.
32423664,Early identification, timely and effective treatments, and maintenance of hemodynamics and electrophysiological stability are of great significance on effective treatment and long-term prognosis.
32423700,We here report a case of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) in Japan in which the initial throat swab polymerase chain reaction result was negative The possibility of false-negative results in the early phase of disease suggest reconsideration of the feasibility of a community or national infection control framework to prevent transmission.
32423700,We recommend establishing an alternative feasible system, such as self-isolation by contact history in non-endemic community and by symptoms in endemic community, not relying on the PCR examination, to minimize this ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.
32423700,Further rapid accumulation of knowledge including incubation period, clinical course and types of transmission is warranted to control this outbreak.
32423842,Due to the wide availability, rapid execution, low cost, and possibility of being acquired at the patient's bed, chest X-Ray is a fundamental tool in the diagnosis, follow-up and evaluation of the treatment effectiveness of patients with pneumonia, also in the context of COVID-19 infection.
32423842,However, false negative cases are possible.
32423842,We report 4 cases of false negative chest X-Rays, in patients who were diagnosed positive for COVID-19 by real-time transverse-transcript-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and executed chest unenhanced CTs just after the X-Rays, demonstrating signs of COVID-19 pneumonia.
32423899,The COVID-19 pandemic is challenging the capacities of health systems in many countries.
32423899,National healthcare services have to manage unexpected shortages of healthcare resources that have to be re-allocated according to the principles of fair and ethical prioritisation, in order to maintain the highest levels of care to all patients, ensure the safety of patients and healthcare workers, and save as many lives as possible.
32423899,Also, cancer care services have to pursue restructuring, following the same evidence-based dispositions.
32423899,In this article, we propose a guidance to the management of pancreatic cancer during the pandemic, prioritised according to a three-tiered framework, and based on expert clinical judgement and magnitude of benefit expected from specific interventions.
32423899,Since the availability of resources for diagnostic procedures, surgery and postoperative care, systemic therapy and radiotherapy may differ, the authors have separated the prioritisation analyses.
32423899,The impact of postponing or abrogating cancer interventions on outcomes according to a high, medium or low priority scale is outlined and discussed.
32423899,The implementation of healthcare services using telemedicine is explored; it reveals itself as functional and effective for limiting patients' need to travel to centres and thereby has the potential to reduce diffusion of SARS-CoV-2.
32423899,Pancreatic cancer demands a considerable amount of medical resources.
32423899,Therefore, the redefinition of its diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms with a rigorous method is crucial in order to ensure the highest quality of continuum of care in the broader context of the pandemic and the challenged healthcare systems.
32423903,A possible association between COVID-19 infection and thrombosis, either as a direct consequence of the virus or as a complication of inflammation, is emerging in the literature.
32423903,Data on the incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) are extremely limited.
32423903,We describe three cases of thromboembolism refractory to heparin treatment, the incidence of VTE in an inpatient cohort, and a case-control study to identify risk factors associated with VTE.
32423903,We identified 274 confirmed (208) or probable (66) COVID-19 patients.
32423903,21 (7.7%) were diagnosed with VTE.
32423903,D-dimer was elevated in both cases (confirmed VTE) and controls (no confirmed VTE) but higher levels were seen in confirmed VTE cases (4.1 vs 1.2 μg/mL, P&lt;0.001).
32423903,Incidence of VTE is high in patients hospitalised with COVID-19.
32423903,Urgent clinical trials are needed to evaluate the role of anticoagulation in COVID-19.
32423903,Monitoring of D-dimer and anti-factor Xa levels may be beneficial in guiding management.
32423917,The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has created an unprecedented global crisis for the infrastructure sectors, including economic, political, healthcare, education, and research systems.
32423917,Although over 90% of infected individuals are asymptomatic or manifest noncritical symptoms and will recover from the infection, those individuals presenting with critical symptoms are in urgent need of effective treatment options.
32423917,Emerging data related to mechanism of severity and potential therapies for patients presenting with severe symptoms are scattered and therefore require a comprehensive analysis to focus research on developing effective therapeutics.
32423917,A critical literature review suggests that the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with dysregulation of inflammatory immune responses, which in turn inhibits the development of protective immunity to the infection.
32423917,Therefore, the use of therapeutics that modulate inflammation without compromising the adaptive immune response could be the most effective therapeutic strategy.
32423922,Every month, DTB scans sources of information on treatments, disease management and other healthcare topics for key items to bring to our readers' attention and help them keep up to date.
32423922,To do this, we produce succinct, contextualised summaries of the information concerned.
32423970,Some of the articles being published during the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 pandemic highlight a link between severe forms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the so-called cytokine storm, also with increased ferritin levels.
32423970,However, this scenario is more complex than initially thought due to the heterogeneity of hyperinflammation.
32423970,Some patients with coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) develop a fully blown secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH), whereas others, despite a consistent release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, do not fulfil sHLH criteria but still show some features resembling the phenotype of the hyperferritinemic syndrome.
32423970,Despite the final event (the cytokine storm) is shared by various conditions leading to sHLH, the aetiology, either infectious, autoimmune or neoplastic, accounts for the differences in the various phases of this process.
32423970,Moreover, the evidence of a hyperinflammatory microenvironment provided the rationale to employ immunomodulating agents for therapeutic purposes in severe COVID-19.
32423970,This viewpoint aims at discussing the pitfalls and issues to be considered with regard to the use of immunomodulating agents in COVID-19, such as timing of treatment based on the viral load and the extent of cytokine/ferritin overexpression.
32423970,Furthermore, it encompasses recent findings in the paediatric field about a novel multisystem inflammatory disease resembling toxic shock syndrome and atypical Kawasaki disease observed in children with proven SARS-CoV2 infection.
32423970,Finally, it includes arguments in favour of adding COVID-19 to the spectrum of the recently defined 'hyperferritinemic syndrome', which already includes adult-onset Still's disease, macrophage activation syndrome, septic shock and catastrophic anti-phospholipid syndrome.
32424085,Beyond their immediate effects on mortality, disasters have widespread, indirect impacts on mental and physical well-being by exposing survivors to stress and potential trauma.
32424085,Identifying the disaster-related stressors that predict health adversity will help officials prepare for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
32424085,Using data from a prospective study of young, low-income mothers who survived Hurricane Katrina, we find that bereavement, fearing for loved ones' well-being, and lacking access to medical care and medications predict adverse mental and physical health 1 y postdisaster, and some effects persist 12 y later.
32424085,Adjusting for preexisting health and socioeconomic conditions attenuates, but does not eliminate, these associations.
32424085,The findings, while drawn from a demographically unique sample, suggest that, to mitigate the indirect effects of COVID-19, lapses in medical care and medication use must be minimized, and public health resources should be directed to those with preexisting medical conditions, their social networks, and the bereaved.
32424293,We studied by questionnaire 530 subjects with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) in Hubei Province during the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
32424293,Five developed confirmed (N = 4) or probable COVID-19 (N = 1).
32424293,Prevalence of COVID-19 in our subjects, 0.9% (95% Confidence Interval, 0.1, 1.8%) was ninefold higher than 0.1% (0, 0.12%) reported in normals but lower than 10% (6, 17%) reported in hospitalised persons with other haematological cancers or normal health-care providers, 7% (4, 12%).
32424293,Co-variates associated with an increased risk of developing COVID-19 amongst persons with CML were exposure to someone infected with SARS-CoV-2 (P = 0.037), no complete haematologic response (P = 0.003) and co-morbidity(ies) (P = 0.024).
32424293,There was also an increased risk of developing COVID-19 in subjects in advanced phase CML (P = 0.004) even when they achieved a complete cytogenetic response or major molecular response at the time of exposure to SARS-CoV-2. 1 of 21 subjects receiving 3rd generation tyrosine kinase-inhibitor (TKI) developed COVID-19 versus 3 of 346 subjects receiving imatinib versus 0 of 162 subjects receiving 2nd generation TKIs (P = 0.096).
32424293,Other co-variates such as age and TKI-therapy duration were not significantly associated with an increased risk of developing COVID-19.
32424293,Persons with these risk factors may benefit from increased surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 infection and possible protective isolation.
32424417,Professional physical therapist education has experienced a transformation over the last few decades, moving to a doctoring profession with more autonomy and a broader scope of practice.
32424417,These changes have occurred in parallel with systemic and structural changes in health care and higher education, both of which have experienced challenges with improving access and controlling costs, and have become a centerpiece of legislative and political discourse.
32424417,At the same time, advances in technology have introduced new possibilities in education, with the emergence of online, blended, and &quot;flipped&quot; learning models that supplement or replace face-to-face instruction with distance learning.
32424417,Hybrid education is a type of blended learning, utilizing both face-to-face and online instructional strategies.
32424417,In a hybrid learning environment, online content may be delivered synchronously or asynchronously, replacing traditional face-to-face instructional time and reducing &quot;seat time&quot; for students.
32424417,Recent attention has been brought to online and hybrid/blended learning in physical therapist education in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, as programs have been required to abruptly move from face to face to remote instruction.
32424417,Hybrid and other forms of blended learning strategies have been described at the physical therapist education course level.
32424417,However, there is no literature describing hybrid learning implementation at the physical therapist education program levsel, and there has been limited discussion on best practices for delivering hybrid, blended, and online instruction in physical therapist education.
32424417,This perspective provides an overview of hybrid education, describes theoretical frameworks that guide implementation of a hybrid education curriculum, and discusses future directions for hybrid physical therapist education and educational research.
32424429,Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) represents a life-saving therapy in cases of refractory hypoxia and has been utilized in patients suffering from the most severe forms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32424429,A strikingly high mortality rate of 94% was described in early reports of patients with COVID-19 transitioned to ECMO.
32424429,Later case reports and series demonstrating successful recovery from COVID-19 after ECMO have revived interest in this therapeutic modality, including the recent approval of ECMO for COVID-19 patients by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
32424429,Here, we present the first reports of devastating intracranial hemorrhage as a complication of veno-venous (VV) ECMO in two COVID-19 patients.
32424429,We performed a retrospective analysis of 2 cases of devastating intracranial hemorrhage in patients on VV-ECMO for the treatment of COVID-19.
32424429,Collected data included clinical history, laboratory results, treatment, and review of all available imaging.
32424429,Both patients demonstrated activated partial thromboplastin times (aPTT) within an appropriate therapeutic range.
32424429,No risk factors that clearly predicted likelihood of this complication were identified.
32424429,Understanding the complications of ECMO in this cohort and developing therapeutic algorithms to aid in optimal patient selection will be critical in the limited resource setting experienced as a result of global pandemic.
32424429,We propose the use of head computed tomography (CT) to identify devastating neurological complications as early as possible, aiding in the resource allocation of ECMO machines to the most appropriately selected patients.
32424489,The global crisis provoked by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and the economic and social consequences associated to the essential policies applied to contain it, necessitates the expedited development of therapeutic solutions.
32424489,It is a priority to produce data both rapidly and accurately in order to identify current therapies that can be repurposed to offer protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32424489,As healthcare workers are both at high risk for infection and able to be readily diagnosed, they offer a potential wealth of data to be analyzed.
32424489,A systematic data analysis of exposure and infection rates among healthcare workers could yield patterns identifying common protective factors, such as medications with prophylactic potential against SARS-CoV-2, that can be fast-tracked into available therapies.
32424489,With results suggesting their activity against other coronaviruses and their widespread adoption, Antiretroviral cocktails could be a promising initial target for such large-scale data analysis approach.
32424616,Three patients of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) showed the symptoms of olfactory dysfunction.
32424616,Clinical characteristics and treatment were retrospective analyzed.
32424616,Olfactory disorders are uncommon symptoms of COVID-19 in China.
32424616,Early diagnosis and intervention are keys to the recovery of olfactory disorders.
32424616,Particular attention should be devoted to olfactory dysfunction.
32424845,In December 2019, a number of pneumonia cases associated with 2019 novel coronavirus occurred in Wuhan, China.
32424845,Later taxonomist name the virus SARS-CoV-2 and disease called COVID-19.
32424845,No approved vaccine or treatment are available for this virus.
32424845,Current technical guide is related to address therapeutic option for SARS-CoV-2.
32424845,COVID-19 is great challenge for scientist across the globe.
32424845,Bioactive compound present in Artemisia annua against, hepatitis B virus, bovine viral diarrhea virus, and Epstein-Barr virus.
32424845,A. annua have shown significant activity against SARS coronavirus that occur in 2002.
32424845,This agent is cheap and easily available and will be of great value if they have efficacy against SARS-CoV-2.
32424845,Scientific attention is needed toward this agent to address for the treatment of COVID-19.
32424977,The global pandemic due to SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in an expansion of telemedicine.
32424977,Measures of quality and barriers for rapid use by patients and physicians are not well described.
32424977,To describe results from a quality improvement initiative during rapid adoptive phase of telemedicine during the pandemic.
32424977,Patient and physician satisfaction with synchronous audiovisual telemedicine visits was measured during early adoptive phase (April 6-17, 2020) within the division of sports medicine in an academic Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (PM&amp;R) department.
32424977,Patients were invited to participate in a quality improvement initiative by completing an online survey at the end of a telemedicine visit.
32424977,Physicians completed a separate survey.
32424977,Patient measures included visit type, duration of encounter, quality, and satisfaction.
32424977,Physicians reported on experiences performing telemedicine.
32424977,Surveys were completed by 119 patients (289 telemedicine encounters, response rate 41%) and 13 physiatrists.
32424977,Telemedicine was utilized primarily for follow-up visits (n=74, 70.6%) and most common duration was 15-29 minutes.
32424977,Patients rated their telemedicine visit as &quot;excellent&quot; or &quot;very good&quot; across measures (91.6-95.0%) including addressing concerns, communication, developing a treatment plan, convenience, and satisfaction.
32424977,Value of completing a future telemedicine visit was measured at 84.9%.
32424977,Most reported estimated travel time saved in excess of 30 minutes.
32424977,Rate of no-show was 2.8%.
32424977,Most physicians (62%) had no prior experience with telemedicine visits, and most were comfortable performing these visits after completing 1-4 sessions (69%).
32424977,Nearly all physicians (92%) rated their telemedicine experience as very good or excellent.
32424977,The key barrier identified for telemedicine was technical issues.
32424977,All physicians reported plans to perform telemedicine visits if reimbursement continues.
32424977,In summary, rapid expansion of telemedicine during COVID-19 pandemic was well-received by a majority of patients and physicians.
32424977,This suggests feasibility in rapid expansion of telemedicine for other outpatient sports medicine practices.

32424990,In order to restrain an uncontrolled spread of the 2019 Coronavirus-Disease (COVID-19) and to provide sufficient intensive-care unit (ICU) capacity, medical specializations needed to develop new routines and risk-strategy protocols.
32424990,Those restrictions have also impacted the urologic community.
32424990,Several medical organisations developed specific information-hubs, blogs and resource centers on how to tackle the COVID-19 situation (1-3).
32424990,Although the German Society of Urology (&quot;DGU&quot;) has published a recommendation to evaluate the need for a timely therapy in prostate cancer (PCa) patients according to D'Amico risk groups on the 2<sup>nd</sup> of April 2020, up to now no compulsory directives exist regarding omitting radical prostatectomy (RP) during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32425002,A novel coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), first identified in Wuhan, China, has been rapidly spreading around the world.
32425002,This study investigates the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients in Zhejiang Province who did or did not have a history of Wuhan exposure.
32425002,We collected data from medical records of confirmed COVID-19 patients in Zhejiang Province from Jan. 17 to Feb. 7, 2020 and analyzed epidemiological, clinical, and treatment data of those with and without recorded recent exposure in Wuhan.
32425002,Patients in the control group were older than those in the exposure group ((48.19±16.13) years vs.
32425002,(43.47±13.12) years, P&lt;0.001), and more were over 65 years old (15.95% control vs.
32425002,5.60% exposure, P&lt;0.001).
32425002,The rate of clustered onset was also significantly higher in the control group than in the exposure group (31.39% vs.
32425002,18.66%, P&lt;0.001).
32425002,The symptom of a sore throat in patients in the exposure group was significantly higher than that in the control group (17.30% vs.
32425002,10.89%, P=0.01); however, headache in the exposure group was significantly lower than that in the control group (6.87% vs.
32425002,12.15%, P=0.015).
32425002,More patients in the exposure group had a significantly lower level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) than those in the control group.
32425002,There was no significant difference in any degree of COVID-19 including mild, severe, and critical between the two groups.
32425002,From the perspective of epidemiological and clinical characteristics, there was no significant difference between COVID-19 patients with and without Wuhan exposure history.
32425010,Severe cases infected with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), named by the World Health Organization (WHO) on Feb. 11, 2020, tend to present a hypercatabolic state because of severe systemic consumption, and are susceptible to stress ulcers and even life-threatening gastrointestinal bleeding.
32425010,Endoscopic diagnosis and treatment constitute an irreplaceable part in the handling of severe COVID-19 cases.
32425010,Endoscopes, as reusable precision instruments with complicated structures, require more techniques than other medical devices in cleaning, disinfection, sterilization, and other reprocessing procedures.
32425010,From 2016 to 2019, health care-acquired infection caused by improper endoscope reprocessing has always been among the top 5 on the list of top 10 health technology hazards issued by the Emergency Care Research Institute.
32425010,Considering the highly infective nature of COVID-19 and the potential aerosol contamination therefrom, it is of pivotal significance to ensure that endoscopes are strictly reprocessed between uses.
32425010,In accordance with the national standard &quot;Regulation for Cleaning and Disinfection Technique of Flexible Endoscope (WS507-2016),&quot; we improved the workflow of endoscope reprocessing including the selection of chemicals in an effort to ensure quality control throughout the clinical management towards COVID-19 patients.
32425010,Based on the experience we attained from the 12 severe COVID-19 cases in our hospital who underwent endoscopy 23 times in total, the article provides an improved version of endoscopic reprocessing guidelines for bedside endoscopic diagnosis and treatment on COVID-19 patients for reference.
32425013,Latest evidences from literature suggest that SARS-CoV-2 disease 2019 (COVID-19) is commonly complicated with coagulopathy and that disseminated intravascular coagulation is present in the majority of deceased patients.
32425013,Particularly, conventional coagulation parameters appear to be significantly altered in patients with poor prognosis.
32425013,A wide-ranging cross- talk between coagulative haemostasis and inflammation, as well as the activation of coagulation cascade during viral infections, are well established.
32425013,Another important evidence which may explain coagulation disorders in COVID-19 is the increase of thrombus formation under conditions of hypoxia.
32425013,Despite the exact pathophysiological mechanism of coronavirus-induced thromboembolism needs to be further investigated, this finding suggests that it is good practice to assess the risk of thrombosis in COVID-19 patients to improvethe clinical management in terms of anticoagulation therapy.
32425013,Anticoagulants, mainly low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), should be tailored in patients meeting sepsis induced coagulopathy (SIC) criteria or with markedly elevated D-dimer.
32425013,In this context, further studies are needed to optimise the decision making in therapeutic approach.
32425051,COVID-19 is a potentially fatal illness with no proven therapy beyond excellent supportive care.
32425051,Treatments are urgently sought.
32425051,Adaptations to traditional trial logistics and design to allow rapid implementation, evaluation of trials within a global trials context, flexible interim monitoring, and access outside traditional research hospitals (even in settings where formal placebos are unavailable) may be helpful.
32425051,Thoughtful adaptations to traditional trial designs-especially within the global context of related studies-may also foster collaborative relationships among government, community, and the research enterprise.
32425051,We describe here the protocol for a pragmatic, active comparator trial in as many as 300 patients comparing two current &quot;off-label&quot; treatments for COVID-19-hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin-in academic and non-academic hospitals in Utah.
32425051,We developed the trial in response to local pressures for widespread, indiscriminate off-label use of these medications.
32425051,We employ a hybrid Bayesian-frequentist design for interim monitoring to allow rapid, contextual assessment of the available evidence.
32425051,We also developed an inference grid for the interpretation of the range of possible results from this trial within the context of parallel trials and prepared for network meta-analysis of the resulting data.
32425051,This trial was prospectively registered (NCT04329832) before enrollment of the first patient.
32425152,The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is the cause of Coronavirus Disease 2019, a new illness with no effective treatment or vaccine that has reached pandemic proportions.
32425152,In this document, we analyze how health authorities and agencies around the world position themselves regarding the off-label use of repurposed drugs or new investigational drugs to treat Coronavirus Disease 2019.
32425152,We review the most promising candidate medicines, including available evidence, clinical recommendations and current options for access.
32425152,Our concluding remarks stress the importance of administering off-label and investigational drugs in the setting of clinical trials, or at least in standardized scenarios, to generate as much scientific knowledge as achievable while engaging in the best efforts to treat patients and save lives.
32425152,O novo severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavírus 2 é a causa da doença por coronavírus 2019, uma doença emergente, sem tratamento eficaz nem vacina, que alcançou proporções de pandemia.
32425152,Neste documento, analisamos a forma como as autoridades e agências de saúde em todo o Mundo se posicionam em relação ao uso de fármacos off-label ou novos produtos de investigação para o tratamento da doença por coronavírus 2019.
32425152,Revemos os fármacos mais promissores, incluindo a evidência disponível, as recomendações clínicas e as atuais opções de acesso a estes medicamentos.
32425152,Concluímos enfatizando a importância de administrar fármacos em uso off-label e produtos de investigação em contexto de ensaios clínicos, ou pelo menos em circunstâncias padronizadas, para que se gere o máximo possível de conhecimento científico a mesmo tempo que se concentram esforços em tratar doentes e salvar vidas.
32425199,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic.
32425199,It is still uncontrolled in most countries and no therapies are currently available.
32425199,Various drugs are under investigation for its treatment.
32425199,The disease is known to have worse outcomes in patients who have underlying cardiovascular disease.
32425199,Chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, remdesivir and lopinavir/ritonavir are currently being studied in trials and show some promise.
32425199,Conduction disorders, heart failure and mortality have been reported with the use of these drugs.
32425199,It is important to have a knowledge of potential cardiotoxic effects of these drugs before using them for COVID-19 patients for better allocation of healthcare resources and improvement in clinical outcomes.
32425222,The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has caused approximately 2,350,000 infections worldwide and killed more than 160,000 individuals.
32425222,In Sainte Anne Hospital (GHU PARIS Psychiatrie &amp; Neuroscience, Paris, France) we have observed a lower incidence of symptomatic forms of COVID-19 among patients than among our clinical staff.
32425222,This observation led us to hypothesize that psychotropic drugs could have a prophylactic action against SARS-CoV-2 and protect patients from the symptomatic and virulent forms of this infection, since several of these psychotropic drugs have documented antiviral properties.
32425222,Chlorpromazine (CPZ), a phenothiazine derivative, is also known for its antiviral activity via the inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis.
32425222,Recent in vitro studies have reported that CPZ exhibits anti-MERS-CoV and anti-SARS-CoV-1 activity.
32425222,In this context, the ReCoVery study aims to repurpose CPZ, a molecule with an excellent tolerance profile and a very high biodistribution in the saliva, lungs and brain.
32425222,We hypothesize that CPZ could reduce the unfavorable course of COVID-19 infection among patients requiring respiratory support without the need for ICU care, and that it could also reduce the contagiousness of SARS-CoV-2.
32425222,For this purpose, we plan a pilot, multicenter, randomized, single blind, controlled, phase III therapeutic trial (standard treatment vs.
32425222,CPZ + standard treatment).
32425222,This repurposing of CPZ for its anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity could offer an alternative, rapid strategy to alleviate infection severity.
32425222,This repurposing strategy also avoids numerous developmental and experimental steps, and could save precious time to rapidly establish an anti-COVID-19 therapy with well-known, limited and easily managed side effects.
32425234,The impact of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is unknown.
32425234,We sought to characterize the clinical course of COVID-19 among IBD patients and evaluate the association between demographics, clinical characteristics, and immunosuppressant treatments on COVID-19 outcomes.
32425234,Surveillance Epidemiology of Coronavirus Under Research Exclusion for Inflammatory Bowel Disease (SECURE-IBD) is a large, international registry created to monitor outcomes of IBD patients with confirmed COVID-19.
32425234,We calculated age-standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and utilized multivariable logistic regression to identify factors associated with severe COVID-19, defined as intensive care unit admission, ventilator use, and/or death. 525 cases from 33 countries were reported (Median age 43 years, 53% men).
32425234,Thirty-seven patients (7%) had severe COVID-19, 161 (31%) were hospitalized, and 16 patients died (3% case fatality rate).
32425234,SMRs for IBD patients were 1.8 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.9-2.6), 1.5 (95% CI 0.7-2.2), and 1.7 (95% CI 0.9-2.5) relative to data from China, Italy, and the US, respectively.
32425234,Risk factors for severe COVID-19 among IBD patients included increasing age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.02), ≥2 comorbidities (aOR 2.9, 95% CI 1.1-7.8), systemic corticosteroids (aOR 6.9, 95% CI 2.3-20.5), and sulfasalazine or 5-aminosalicylate use (aOR 3.1, 95% CI 1.3-7.7).
32425234,TNF antagonist treatment was not associated with severe COVID-19 (aOR 0.9, 95% CI 0.4-2.2).
32425234,Increasing age, comorbidities, and corticosteroids are associated with severe COVID-19 among IBD patients, although a causal relationship cannot be definitively established.
32425234,Notably, TNF antagonists do not appear to be associated with severe COVID-19.
32425237,A mysterious cluster outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, China in December 2019 was traced to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 and declared a Pandemic by WHO on 11th March 2020.
32425237,The pandemic has spread rapidly causing widespread devastation globally.
32425237,This review provides a brief understanding of pathophysiology, clinical features, diagnosis and management of COVID-19 and highlights the current knowledge as well as best practices for orthopaedic surgeons.
32425237,These are likely to change as knowledge and evidence is gained.
32425237,Orthopaedic surgeons, like other front-line workers, carry the risk of getting infected during their practice, which as such is already substantially affected.
32425237,Implementation of infection prevention and control as well as other safety measures for health care workers assumes great importance.
32425237,All patients/visitors and staff visiting the hospital should be screened.
32425237,Conservative treatment should be the first line of treatment except for those requiring urgent/emergent care.
32425237,During lockdown all elective surgeries are to be withheld.
32425237,All attempts should be made to reduce hospital visits and telemedicine is to be encouraged.
32425237,Inpatient management of COVID-19 patients requires approval from concerned authorities.
32425237,All patients being admitted to the hospital in and around containment zones should be tested for COVID-19.
32425237,There are special considerations for anaesthesia with preference for regional anaesthesia.
32425237,A separate Operation room with specific workflow should be dedicated for COVID-19 positive cases.
32425237,Despite the magnitude of challenge, the pandemic offers significant lessons for the orthopaedic surgeon who should seek the opportunity within the adversity and use this time wisely to achieve his/her Ikigai.
32425239,A novel coronavirus disease that emerged in China in December 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread to all over the world, leading to 823 626 people diagnosed and 40 598 deaths globally as of April 1, 2020.
32425239,Nurses are providing care to patients with COVID-19 who require hospitalization.
32425239,To ensure adequate response capacity and to maintain the health of nurses at risk of infection, it is important to analyse the actual work hours and the nurses reported preferred work hours per shift among frontline nurses.
32425239,To analyse the actual work hours and preferred work hours per shift of nurses reports among frontline nurses fighting the COVID-19 epidemic and to explore the influencing factors on the nurses reported preferred work hours.
32425239,Cross-sectional survey.
32425239,This study was conducted in 10 designated hospitals providing treatments to patients with COVID-19 in China.
32425239,Nurses providing care to patients with COVID-19 in designated hospitals in China.
32425239,A self-designed questionnaire with open-ended questions was used to assess frontline nurses caring for COVID-19 cases in 10 designated hospitals.
32425239,Quantitative and qualitative methods were used to analyse the actual work hours, the nurses reported preferred work hours and factors influencing nurses reported preferred work hours among the frontline nurses.
32425239,A total of 109 nurses responded to the survey.
32425239,The actual work hours per shift among frontline nurses were exceeded the nurses reported preferred work hours [Median (interquartile range): 5.00(2.00) h vs 4.00 (2.00)h; Minmum-Maxmum: 4-12 h vs 4-8 h], and 60.55% (66/109) of the nurses regarded 4 h as the preferred number of work hours per shift.
32425239,Five key themes associated with the influencing factors emerged, including circumstances, personal preventable equipment, the physical and emotional needs of nurse, the safety needs of nurse and work intensity.
32425239,These findings suggest that there is a gap between the actual work hours and the nurses reported preferred work hours among frontline nurses in different units and different posts.
32425239,The main influencing factors were circumstances, personal preventable equipment, the physical and emotional needs of nurse, the safety needs of nurse and work intensity.
32425244,The emerging coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has caused a COVID-19 pandemic.
32425244,SARS-CoV-2 causes a generally mild, but sometimes severe and even life-threatening infection, known as COVID-19.
32425244,Currently, there exist no effective vaccines or drugs and, as such, global public authorities have so far relied upon non pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs).
32425244,Since COVID-19 symptoms are aspecific and may resemble a common cold, if it should come back with a seasonal pattern and coincide with the influenza season, this would be particularly challenging, overwhelming and straining the healthcare systems, particularly in resource-limited contexts, and would increase the likelihood of nosocomial transmission.
32425244,In the present study, we devised a mathematical model focusing on the treatment of people complaining of influenza-like-illness (ILI) symptoms, potentially at risk of contracting COVID-19 or other emerging/re-emerging respiratory infectious agents during their admission at the health-care setting, who will occupy the detection kits causing a severe shortage of testing resources.
32425244,The model is used to assess the effect of mass influenza vaccination on the spread of COVID-19 and other respiratory pathogens in the case of a coincidence of the outbreak with the influenza season.
32425244,Here, we show that increasing influenza vaccine uptake or enhancing the public health interventions would facilitate the management of respiratory outbreaks coinciding with the peak flu season, especially, compensate the shortage of the detection resources.
32425244,However, how to increase influenza vaccination coverage rate remains challenging.
32425244,Public health decision- and policy-makers should adopt evidence-informed strategies to improve influenza vaccine uptake.
32425246,With the rapid, global spread of SARS-CoV-2, hospitals have become inundated with patients suffering from COVID-19.
32425246,Consultation-liaison psychiatrists are actively involved in managing these patients and should familiarize themselves with how the virus and its proposed treatments can affect psychotropic management.
32425246,The only FDA approved drug to treat COVID-19 is remdesivir, and other off-label medications used include chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab, lopinavir/ritonavir, favipiravir, convalescent plasma therapy, azithromycin, vitamin C, corticosteroids, interferon and colchicine.
32425246,To provide an overview of the major safety considerations relevant to clinicians who prescribe psychotropics to patients with COVID-19, both related to the illness and its proposed treatments.
32425246,In this targeted review we performed structured literature searches in PubMed to identify articles describing the impacts of COVID-19 on different organ systems, the neuropsychiatric adverse effects of treatments, and any potential drug interactions with psychotropics.
32425246,The articles most relevant to this manuscript were included.
32425246,COVID-19 impacts multiple organ systems, including gastrointestinal, renal, cardiovascular, pulmonary, immunological, and hematological systems.
32425246,This may lead to pharmacokinetic changes that impact psychotropic medications and increase sensitivity to psychotropic-related adverse effects.
32425246,Additionally, several proposed treatments for COVID-19 have neuropsychiatric effects and potential interactions with commonly used psychotropics.
32425246,Clinicians should be aware of the need to adjust existing psychotropics or avoid using certain medications in some COVID-19 patients.
32425246,They should also be familiar with neuropsychiatric effects of medications being used to treat this disease.
32425246,Further research is needed to identify strategies to manage psychiatric issues in this population.
32425251,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused more than 200,000 reported COVID-19 cases in Spain resulting in more than 20,800 deaths as of April 21, 2020.
32425251,Faecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from COVID-19 patients has extensively been reported.
32425251,Therefore, we investigated the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in six wastewater treatments plants (WWTPs) serving the major municipalities within the Region of Murcia (Spain), the area with the lowest COVID-19 prevalence within Iberian Peninsula.
32425251,Firstly, an aluminum hydroxide adsorption-precipitation concentration method was validated using a porcine coronavirus (Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus, PEDV) and mengovirus (MgV).
32425251,The procedure resulted in average recoveries of 10 ± 3.5% and 10 ± 2.1% in influent water (n = 2) and 3.3 ± 1.6% and 6.2 ± 1.0% in effluent water (n = 2) samples for PEDV and MgV, respectively.
32425251,Then, the method was used to monitor the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 from March 12 to April 14, 2020 in influent, secondary and tertiary effluent water samples.
32425251,By using the real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) Diagnostic Panel validated by US CDC that targets three regions of the virus nucleocapsid (N) gene, we estimated quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA titers in untreated wastewater samples of 5.4 ± 0.2 log<sub>10</sub> genomic copies/L on average.
32425251,Two secondary water samples resulted positive (2 out of 18) and all tertiary water samples tested as negative (0 out 12).
32425251,This environmental surveillance data were compared to declared COVID-19 cases at municipality level, revealing that members of the community were shedding SARS-CoV-2 RNA in their stool even before the first cases were reported by local or national authorities in many of the cities where wastewaters have been sampled.
32425251,The detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater in early stages of the spread of COVID-19 highlights the relevance of this strategy as an early indicator of the infection within a specific population.
32425251,At this point, this environmental surveillance could be implemented by municipalities right away as a tool, designed to help authorities to coordinate the exit strategy to gradually lift its coronavirus lockdown.
32425259,IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is an immune-mediated multi-organ, chronic and progressive disease.
32425259,Therefore, we conducted a study to investigate the susceptibility of COVID-19 in IgG4-RD patients in Hubei province, and to characterize the clinical manifestation of COVID-19 in IgG4-RD patients.
32425259,A follow-up system that includes over 200 IgG4-RD patients across the country during the past ten years.
32425259,A total of ninety-one patients with IgG4-RD who live in Hubei, China were identified and responded to our survey.
32425259,Medical history, clinical symptoms, laboratory tests, CT imaging, and treatment were obtained through a standardized data collection form, and then independently reviewed by two investigators. 2 of 91 cases were infected with COVID-19.
32425259,Both of them were classified as moderate type.
32425259,The symptoms such as fever and cough and radiologic features were similar to other COVID-19 patients.
32425259,Neither of them episode recurrent of IgG4-RD nor progressed to severe or critical condition of COVID-19 under the condition of continuous oral low-dose of glucocorticoids.
32425259,Besides, patient 2 took a long time for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid to turn negative.
32425259,IgG4-RD patients may belongs to the susceptible population of COVID-19 infection, and thus need more careful personal protection.
32425259,Early identification and properly treatment are very important to prevent IgG4-RD patients with COVID-19 from progression to severe condition.
32425260,To investigate the incidence of COVID-19 in a cohort of adult and paediatric patients with rheumatic diseases receiving targeted biologic and synthetic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (tDMARDs) and to explore the possible effect of these treatments in the clinical expression of COVID-19.
32425260,A cross-sectional study comprising of a telephone survey and electronic health records review was performed including all adult and paediatric patients with rheumatic diseases treated with tDMARDs in a large rheumatology tertiary centre in Barcelona, Spain.
32425260,Demographics, disease activity, COVID-19 related symptoms and contact history data were obtained from the start of the 2020 pandemic.
32425260,Cumulative incidence of confirmed cases (SARS-CoV-2 positive PCR test) was compared to the population estimates for the same city districts from a governmental COVID-19 health database.
32425260,Suspected cases were defined following WHO criteria and compared to those without compatible symptoms. 959 patients with rheumatic diseases treated with tDMARDs were included.
32425260,We identified 11 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive cases in the adult cohort and no confirmed positive cases in the paediatric cohort.
32425260,COVID-19 incidence rates of the rheumatic patient cohort were very similar to that of the general population [(0.48% (95% CI 0.09 to 0.87%)] and [0.58% (95% CI 0.56 to 0.60%)], respectively.
32425260,We found significant differences in tDMARDs proportions between the suspected and non-suspected cases (p=0.002).
32425260,Adult and paediatric patients with rheumatic diseases on tDMARDs do not seem to present a higher risk of COVID-19 or a more severe disease outcome when compared to general population.
32425268,A global pandemic caused by a novel coronavirus (Covid-19) has created unique challenges to providing timely care for cancer patients.
32425268,In early-stage cervical cancer, postponing hysterectomy for 6-8 weeks is suggested as a possible option in the Covid-19 burdened hospitals.
32425268,Yet, literature examining the impact of surgery wait-time on survival in early-stage cervical cancer remains scarce.
32425268,This study examined the association between surgery wait-time of 8 weeks and oncologic outcome in women with early-stage cervical cancer.
32425268,This is a single institution retrospective observational study at a tertiary referral medical center examining women who underwent primary hysterectomy or trachelectomy for clinical stage IA-IIA invasive cervical cancer between 2000 and 2017 (<i>N</i> = 217).
32425268,Wait-time from the diagnosis of invasive cervical cancer <i>via</i> biopsy to definitive surgery was categorized as: short wait-time (&lt;8 weeks; <i>n</i> = 110) <i>versus</i> long wait-time (≥8 weeks; <i>n</i> = 107).
32425268,Propensity score inverse probability of treatment weighting was used to balance the measured demographics between the two groups, and disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were assessed.
32425268,A systematic literature review with meta-analysis was performed.
32425268,In a weighted model (median follow-up, 4.6 years), women in the long wait-time group had DFS (4.5-year rates, 91.2% <i>versus</i> 90.7%, hazard ratio [HR] 1.11, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.47-2.59, <i>P</i> = 0.818) and OS (95.0% <i>versus</i> 97.4%, HR 1.47, 95%CI 0.50-4.31, <i>P</i> = 0.487) similar to those in the short wait-time group.
32425268,Three studies were examined for meta-analysis (median, <i>n</i> = 217), and a pooled HR for surgery wait-time of ≥8 weeks on DFS was 0.96 (95%CI 0.59-1.55).
32425268,Our study suggests that wait-time of 8 weeks for hysterectomy may not be associated with short-term disease recurrence in women with early-stage cervical cancer.
32425269,COVID-19 can manifest as a viral induced hyperinflammation with multi-organ involvement.
32425269,Such patients often experience rapid deterioration and need for mechanical ventilation.
32425269,Currently, no prospectively validated biomarker of impending respiratory failure is available.
32425269,We aimed to identify and prospectively validate biomarkers that allow the identification of patients in need of impending mechanical ventilation.
32425269,Patients with COVID-19 hospitalized from February 29<sup>th</sup> to April 09<sup>th</sup>, 2020 were analyzed for baseline clinical and laboratory findings at admission and during the disease.
32425269,Data from 89 evaluable patients were available for the purpose of analysis comprising an initial evaluation cohort (n=40) followed by a temporally separated validation cohort (n=49).
32425269,We identified markers of inflammation, LDH and creatinine as most predictive variables of respiratory failure in the evaluation cohort.
32425269,Maximal interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels before intubation showed the strongest association with the need of mechanical ventilation followed by maximal CRP.
32425269,Respective AUC values for IL-6 and CRP in the evaluation cohort were 0.97 and 0.86 and similar in the validation cohort 0.90 and 0.83.
32425269,The calculated optimal cutoff values in the course of disease from the evaluation cohort (IL-6&gt; 80 pg/ml and CRP&gt; 97 mg/l) both correctly classified 80% of patients in the validation cohort regarding their risk of respiratory failure.
32425269,Maximal levels of IL-6 followed by CRP were highly predictive of the need for mechanical ventilation.
32425269,This suggests the possibility of using IL-6 or CRP levels to guide escalation of treatment in patients with COVID-19 related hyperinflammatory syndrome.
32425275,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is putting healthcare professionals, especially those in the frontline, under extreme pressures, with a high risk of experiencing physical exhaustion, psychological disturbance, stigmatization, insomnia, depression and anxiety.
32425275,We report the case of a general practitioner, without relevant medical or psychiatric history that experienced a &quot;brief reactive psychosis (298.8)&quot; under stressful circumstances derived from COVID-19.
32425275,She presented with delusional ideas of catastrophe regarding the current pandemic situation, delusions of self-reference, surveillance and persecution, with high affective and behavioural involvement.
32425275,Physical examination and all further additional investigations did not reveal any secondary causes.
32425275,She was administered olanzapine 10 mg with a significant psychopathological improvements being discharged with indications to maintain the treatment.
32425275,To our knowledge this is the first case of severe mental illness in a healthcare professional without previous psychiatric history due to COVID-19 outbreak.
32425275,Around 85% of patients presenting a brief psychotic disorder will develop a potentially disabling serious psychotic illness in the long-term.
32425275,This case represents the potentially serious mental health consequences on healthcare professionals throughout the COVID-19 crisis and emphasizes the need to implement urgent measures to maintain staff mental health during the current pandemic.
32425294,A subset of patients with severe COVID-19 develop profound inflammation and multi-organ dysfunction consistent with a &quot;Cytokine Storm Syndrome&quot; (CSS).
32425294,In this review we compare the clinical features, diagnosis, and pathogenesis of COVID-CSS with other hematological CSS, namely secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH), idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease (iMCD), and CAR-T cell therapy associated Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS).
32425294,Novel therapeutics targeting cytokines or inhibiting cell signaling pathways have now become the mainstay of treatment in these CSS.
32425294,We review the evidence for cytokine blockade and attenuation in these known CSS as well as the emerging literature and clinical trials pertaining to COVID-CSS.
32425294,Established markers of inflammation as well as cytokine levels are compared and contrasted between these four entities in order to establish a foundation for future diagnostic criteria of COVID-CSS.
32425305,SARS-CoV-2 virus has resulted in a devastating pandemic of COVID-19.
32425305,Exploring compounds that could offer a breakthrough in treatment is the need of the hour.
32425305,Re-positioning cheap, freely available and safe drugs is a priority.
32425305,The paper proposes evidence for the potential use of diethylcarbamazine (DEC) in the treatment of COVID-19.
32425305,DEC has inhibitory effects on arachidonic acid metabolism to prostaglandins, little known anti-viral effects on animal retroviruses and demonstrated anti-inflammatory actions in animal models of lung inflammation indicating the need to explore this hypothesis further.
32425305,We believe this is the first time DEC is being proposed to treat COVID-19.
32425315,This article examines whether women are less prone than men to Covid-19 infections and their complications.
32425315,We reviewed available databases and searched systematically for publications.
32425315,To be taken into account, data had to be broken down by gender.
32425315,There was no study evaluation nor quantification synthesis, due to the large heterogeneity of the studies.
32425315,Nineteen databases were selected. 73 publications were considered and 33 were selected, to which 12 more were added.
32425315,Globally, the proportion of men and women who tested positive is comparable.
32425315,However, men are about 60% more likely to be severely ill or to die from the complications of Covid-19 than are women.
32425315,The study was hampered by a large heterogeneity in testing and reporting of the data.
32425315,Although in the pandemic men die more frequently than women from Covid-19, it is not clear whether this is due to biological differences between men and women, differences in behavioral habits, or differences in the rates of co-morbidities.
32425315,Countries and studies should report their data by age, gender and co-morbidities.
32425315,This may have implications in terms of vaccination strategies, the choice of treatments and future consequences for long-term health issues concerning gender equality.
32425317,the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), hospitals worldwide are at risk of nosocomial infection.
32425317,Preoperative identification of COVID-19 in patients who are scheduled to be admitted to the hospital is essential to preventing the collapse of medical facility.
32425317,In Japan, the preoperative observation and screening tests with the RT-PCR testing for the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and chest CT scan are recommended for head and neck cancer surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32425317,We conducted surveys of the current situation in Japan through the internet.
32425317,Chest CT scan was fully performed (90%), but the RT-PCR testing was not adequately performed (51%).
32425317,Although the current screening system can be considered effective to a certain extent, we recommend further widespread use of pre-admission RT-PCR testing not only for patients with head and neck cancer surgery but also for all the hospitalized patients, in order to promote safer treatments, during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32425321,Much of the focus regarding the global pandemic of coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) has been on the cardiovascular, pulmonary, and hematologic complications.
32425321,However, neurologic complications have arisen as an increasingly recognized area of morbidity and mortality.
32425321,This brief report summarizes the neurologic complications associated with COVID-19 with an emphasis on the emergency medicine clinician.
32425321,COVID-19 has infected over 3.5 million people and killed over 240,000 people worldwide.
32425321,While pulmonary complications are profound, the neurologic system is also significantly impacted, with complications including acute cerebrovascular events, encephalitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, acute necrotizing hemorrhagic encephalopathy, and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.
32425321,Additionally, patients on immunosuppressive medications for pre-existing neurologic issues are at an increased risk for complications with COVID-19 infection, and many of the currently proposed COVID-19 therapies can interact with these medications.
32425321,When caring for COVID-19 patients, emergency medicine clinicians should be aware of the neurologic complications from COVID-19.
32425326,The primary purpose of the current study was to investigate and summarize the registered trials that listed COVID-19 as the primary condition.
32425326,We performed a search on ClinicalTrials.gov using the independent search terms COVID-19, SARS, and SARS COV2, and then downloaded the data file on March 23, 2020.
32425326,All trials were downloaded to a csv file and searched for appropriateness.
32425326,Fifty-six of 124 (45.2%) registered trials were listed as recruiting.
32425326,The majority (85, 68.5%) classified their study as interventional, 37 (29.8%) classified as observational and one (0.8%) each classified their study as either expanded access:individual patients | treatment IND/Protocol or expanded access:intermediate-size population | treatment IND/Protocol.
32425326,There were 67 (54.0%) of the trials that listed drug as the type of study.
32425326,Immunological and antiviral trials were the greatest, representing approximately 30% and 21%, respectively.
32425326,When immunological and antiviral drugs were used alone or in combination, they represented 41.9% and 34.4%, respectively.
32425326,Anti-malarial agents are represented in 7.5% of trials.
32425326,Approximately 14% of trials involved Traditional Chinese Medicine.
32425326,The aforementioned study agents used solely or in combination represented approximately 80% of therapeutic approaches to COVID19.
32425326,There was a large and quick response on ClinicalTrials.gov to the COVID-19 outbreak.
32425326,Many of the registered trials are currently recruiting new patients, while some will begin in the near future.
32425326,Specific potential experimental therapies, including dosing and monitoring, might be found by reviewing content.
32425326,Within clinicaltrials.gov, patients, family members, health care professionals and researchers can search and find ongoing and future trials for COVID-19.
32425328,The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), represents the pandemic of the century, with approximately 3.5 million cases and 250,000 deaths worldwide as of May 2020.
32425328,Although respiratory symptoms usually dominate the clinical presentation, COVID-19 is now known to also have potentially serious cardiovascular consequences, including myocardial injury, myocarditis, acute coronary syndromes, pulmonary embolism, stroke, arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiogenic shock.
32425328,The cardiac manifestations of COVID-19 might be related to the adrenergic drive, systemic inflammatory <i>milieu</i> and cytokine-release syndrome caused by SARS-CoV-2, direct viral infection of myocardial and endothelial cells, hypoxia due to respiratory failure, electrolytic imbalances, fluid overload, and side effects of certain COVID-19 medications.
32425328,COVID-19 has profoundly reshaped usual care of both ambulatory and acute cardiac patients, by leading to the cancellation of elective procedures and by reducing the efficiency of existing pathways of urgent care, respectively.
32425328,Decreased utilization of healthcare services for acute conditions by non-COVID-19 patients has also been reported and attributed to concerns about acquiring in-hospital infection.
32425328,Innovative approaches that leverage modern technologies to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic have been introduced, which include telemedicine, dissemination of educational material over social media, smartphone apps for case tracking, and artificial intelligence for pandemic modelling, among others.
32425328,This article provides a comprehensive overview of the pathophysiology and cardiovascular implications of COVID-19, its impact on existing pathways of care, the role of modern technologies to tackle the pandemic, and a proposal of novel management algorithms for the most common acute cardiac conditions.
32425336,To analyze clinical and thin-section computed tomographic (CT) data from the patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) to predict the development of pulmonary fibrosis after hospital discharge.
32425336,Fifty-nine patients (31 males, 28 females; mean age: 41 years, range: 25 to 70 years) with confirmed COVID-19 infection performed follow-up thin-section CT of the thorax.
32425336,After 31.5 days of hospital admission, the results of thin-section CT were analyzed for parenchymal abnormality (ground-glass opacification, interstitial thickening, and consolidation) and evidence of fibrosis (parenchymal band, traction bronchiectasis, and irregular interfaces).
32425336,Patients were analyzed based on the evidence of fibrosis and divided into two groups, group A (with CT evidence of fibrosis) and group B (without CT evidence of fibrosis).
32425336,Patient demographics, length of stay (LOS), rate of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, peak C-reactive protein level, and CT score were compared between the two groups.
32425336,Among the 59 patients, 89.8% (53/59) patients had a typical transition from early phase to advanced phase and advanced phase to dissipating phase.
32425336,Out of 59 patients, 39% (23/59) patients developed fibrosis (group A), whereas 61% (36/59) patients did not show definite fibrosis (group B).
32425336,Patients in group A were older (mean age, 45.4 vs.
32425336,33.8 years), with longer LOS (19.1 vs.
32425336,15.0 days), higher rate of ICU admission (21.7% (5/23) vs.
32425336,5.6% (2/36)), higher peak C-reactive protein level (30.7 vs.
32425336,18.1 mg/L), and higher maximal CT score (5.2 vs.
32425336,4.0) than those in group B.
32425336,Pulmonary fibrosis may develop early in patients with COVID-19 after hospital discharge.
32425336,Older patients with severe illness during treatment were more prone to develop fibrosis according to thin-section CT results.
32425361,Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) has resulted in a global outbreak.
32425361,Few existing targeted medications are available.
32425361,Lianhuaqingwen (LH) capsule, a repurposed marketed Chinese herb product, has been proven effective for influenza.
32425361,To determine the safety and efficacy of LH capsule in patients with Covid-19.
32425361,We did a prospective multicenter open-label randomized controlled trial on LH capsule in confirmed cases with Covid-19.
32425361,Patients were randomized to receive usual treatment alone or in combination with LH capsules (4 capsules, thrice daily) for 14 days.
32425361,The primary endpoint was the rate of symptom (fever, fatigue, coughing) recovery.
32425361,We included 284 patients (142 each in treatment and control group) in the full-analysis set.
32425361,The recovery rate was significantly higher in treatment group as compared with control group (91.5% vs.
32425361,82.4%, <i>P</i>=0.022).
32425361,The median time to symptom recovery was markedly shorter in treatment group (median: 7 vs. 10 days, <i>P</i>&lt;0.001).
32425361,Time to recovery of fever (2 vs. 3 days), fatigue (3 vs. 6 days) and coughing (7 vs. 10 days) was also significantly shorter in treatment group (all <i>P</i>&lt;0.001).
32425361,The rate of improvement in chest computed tomographic manifestations (83.8% vs.
32425361,64.1%, <i>P</i>&lt;0.001) and clinical cure (78.9% vs.
32425361,66.2%, <i>P=</i>0.017) was also higher in treatment group.
32425361,However, both groups did not differ in the rate of conversion to severe cases or viral assay findings (both <i>P</i>&gt;0.05).
32425361,No serious adverse events were reported.
32425361,In light of the safety and effectiveness profiles, LH capsules could be considered to ameliorate clinical symptoms of Covid-19.
32425428,Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is an innovative mean of amalgamating medical devices and their applications to connect with the healthcare information technology systems by using networking technologies.
32425428,We have explored the possibilities of confronting the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic by implementing the IoMT approach while offering treatment to orthopaedic patients.
32425428,The data sharing, report monitoring, patients tracking, information gathering and analysis, hygiene medical care, etc. are the various cloud and connected network-based services of IoMT.
32425428,It can completely change the working layout of the healthcare facilities while treating orthopaedic patients with a superior level of care and more satisfaction, especially during this pandemic COVID-19 lockdown.
32425428,Remote-location healthcare has also become feasible with the proposed IoMT approach.
32425429,COVID-19 pandemic has brought the need to revisit the conservative management of orthopaedic injuries back into sharp focus.
32425429,On the advent of COVID-19 pandemic, it has been acknowledged by the British Orthopaedic Association (BOA) emergency COVID-19 and the National Health Service England (NHSE) guidelines to manage urgent orthopaedic and trauma conditions pragmatically balancing optimum treatment of patients against clinical safety with resource utilization .
32425429,The current Coronavirus outbreak has refocussed orthopaedic minds on managing many injuries conservatively, which would have otherwise been managed with operative fixations.
32425429,We revisit the role of conservative orthopaedic management of fractures in the context of COVID-19 and current guidelines.
32425471,The elderly are at high risk of contracting respiratory infectious diseases, including COVID-19 infection.
32425471,The recent pandemic has the potential to cause significant physical and mental damage in older adults.
32425471,Similarly to other mind-body exercises in Traditional Chinese medicine, Qigong features regulation of breath rhythm and pattern, body movement and posture, and meditation.
32425471,Given these traits, Qigong has the potential to play a role in the prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation of respiratory infections, such as COVID-19.
32425471,Potential mechanisms of action include stress reduction, emotion regulation, strengthening of respiratory muscles, reduction of inflammation, and enhanced immune function.
32425471,Three forms of Qigong; abdominal breathing, Ba Duan Jin and Liu Zi Jue, all of which are gentle, smooth, and simple for the elderly to practice, are recommended in this context.
32425485,The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (COVID-19) is affecting elderly people worldwide with greater incidence and severity.
32425485,In Spain, 68% of all coronavirus hospitalizations correspond to those over 60 years of age.
32425485,This work aims to highlight the evidence about the measures to be implemented through current and future guidelines.
32425485,The need to prepare for action by implementing international protocols stand out.
32425485,There is a trend towards biopsychosocial care of elderly people in all settings where they are, adapting care and personalizing decisions on hospital admissions, palliative care, among other criteria, to years adjusted to quality of life, as well as alternatives for monitoring and treatment of COVID-19 pathology and others existing in this population group.
32425485,Measures to reduce the transmission of the virus through hygiene and social distancing are necessary, attending to biopsychosocial health of the elderly isolated.
32425485,Intersectoral communication is proposed as innovative alternatives, and the use of technological tools, accompanied by adequate digital health literacy.
32425485,Future lines focus on guaranteeing social and health rights, equating the social and health system at the same level, and achieving real coordination.
32425485,A new framework of person-centered care could be a great ally to achieve integrated care for the elderly, guided by an increase in resources bound to funding longevity research projects.
32425486,This review aims to map scientific evidence in nursing care aimed at controlling coronavirus infections.
32425486,A bibliographic search was conducted in the Medline, CINAHL, Scopus and WOS main databases, with no date limit and using the keywords &quot;transmission&quot;, &quot;infection&quot;, &quot;contagious&quot;, &quot;spreads&quot;, &quot;coronavirinae&quot;, &quot;coronavirus&quot;, &quot;COVID 19&quot;, &quot;sars cov 2&quot;, &quot;nurses&quot; and &quot;nursing&quot;.
32425486,Initially, 154 studies were identified and, after selecting them according to eligibility criteria, 16 were included.
32425486,Among the main recommendations according to the available evidence are air exchange in rooms as a measure to reduce the risk of infection among patients; reinforcement of measures in intensive care units; follow-up of positive case contacts; and adequate training of professionals.
32425486,The studies included in the review addressed infection prevention and control practices by analyzing risks associated with exposure and listing actions to avoid complications in critically ill patients.
32425486,Patterns of case transmission, contacts and associated factors were identified.
32425486,Professional knowledge and attitudes were also studied, showing the importance of good infection control training, and of sufficient equipment and adequate infrastructure.Nurses are important vectors of spread.
32425486,Although there is little evidence available on the effectiveness of care to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2, published studies on the prevention and control of previous outbreaks of coronavirus are of considerable value.
32425488,Based on the report on the situation of COVID-19 in Spain, dated April 3, 2020, the confirmed cases amount to 117,710, of which 343 are under 14 years of age (&lt;1%).
32425488,It is essential to know the specificity of this process in the child population, as well the specific recommendations for proper prevention and care of children during the COVID-19 Pandemic.
32425488,Our objective is to analyze the scientific evidence on the specific recommendations for pediatric care in cases of COVID-19 from the family and community settings.The main recommendations and preventive measures in primary health care settings and at home have been selected and analyzed from an integrative approach that includes the biopsychosocial aspects of the child during confinement.The importance of caring for children in the face of the disease lies above all in ensuring the correct measures for the prevention of contagion due to the condition of acting as possible carriers during an incubation period of up to 21 days.
32425488,The recommendation is that children actively participate in routine preventive actions to contain the spread of the disease.
32425488,At the household level, isolation is an important challenge for families where there are manifestations of uncertainty, fear and helplessness in the face of changes and among the recommendations are establishing routines and order through schedules of activities and leisure together with hygiene measures.Given the rapidity with which the COVID-19 pandemic has occurred, there is little evidence at the moment.
32425488,Research on prevention and treatment in the pediatric age needs to be developed to improve the available recommendations.
32425489,To compile recommendations and evidence on the practical management of pregnant women with COVIC-19 in order to clarify standards of obstetric care in the face of this new disease.
32425489,Scoping review based on literaature searches in national and international health science databases (Pubmed/Medline, Biblioteca virtual en salud (BVS), Scielo, COCHRANE and CUIDEN) and websites, and additionally by a &quot;snowball&quot; system.
32425489,MeSH terms were used: &quot;COVID-19&quot;, &quot;Pregnancy&quot;, &quot;Delivery, Obstetric&quot; &quot;Pregnant Women&quot; and &quot;Maternal&quot;.
32425489,As limits in the search Spanish and English languages were selected.
32425489,No limits were established in relation to the year of publication or type of article.
32425489,A total of 49 documents and articles were detected, of which 27 were analyzed, 18 were used, and 9 were discarded because they did not contain practical recommendations.
32425489,The recommendations were grouped into 9 subjects: Prevention of infection in pregnant women, Prevention of infection in health care personnel attending pregnant women, Form of presentation and severity in pregnant women, Maternal-fetal transmission (vertical and perinatal), Maternal-fetal control of the pregnant woman infected with COVID-19, Control of the severely pregnant woman with COVID-19, Treatment of the pregnant woman with COVID-19, Management and route of termination of labor, Neonatal outcomes in women with COVID-19 and Breastfeeding.
32425489,Lack of strong evidence to support many of the recommendations for pregnant women with COVID-19, as they are based on previous experience with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections.
32425489,Further studies are needed to confirm the appropriateness of many of the recommendations and guidelines for action in the specific case of pregnant women and COVIC-19.
32425491,In late December 2019, some cases of atypical pneumonia, at that time of unknown origin, were reported in Wuhan, China.
32425491,Days later, the etiologic agent was identified as a new coronavirus.
32425491,This new coronavirus was called SARS-CoV-2 and the disease it produces was named COVID-19.
32425491,The origin of this new virus is presumed zoonotic, with bats being its probable vector.
32425491,Due to the rapid number of infections and deaths that occurred first in China and later around the world, the infection of this virus quickly went from being an isolated outbreak in a Chinese region to becoming a health emergency of international concern and later, a pandemic.
32425491,The purpose of this review is to study the most relevant and current information on the pathogen, as well as epidemiology, pathology, clinical features, transmission, prevention, and treatment of the disease.
32425631,Public health officials need tools to assist with anticipating the healthcare resources required to confront the SARS-COV-2 pandemic.
32425631,We built a modeling tool to aid practicing public health officials with estimating healthcare demand from the pandemic in their jurisdictions and to evaluate the potential impacts of population-wide social-distancing interventions.
32425631,The tool uses a SEIR compartmental model to project the pandemic's local spread.
32425631,Users input case counts, healthcare resources, and select intervention strategies to evaluate.
32425631,Outputs include the number of infections and deaths with and without intervention, and the demand for hospital and critical care beds and ventilators relative to existing capacity.
32425631,We illustrate the tool using data from three regions of Chile.
32425631,Our scenarios indicate a surge in COVID-19 patients could overwhelm Chilean hospitals by June, peaking in July or August at 6 to 50 times the current supply of beds and ventilators.
32425631,A lockdown strategy or combination of case isolation, home quarantine, social distancing of individuals &gt;70 years, and telework interventions may keep treatment demand below capacity.
32425631,Aggressive interventions can avert substantial morbidity and mortality from COVID-19.
32425631,Our tool permits rapid evaluation of locally-applicable policy scenarios and updating of results as new data become available.
32425636,To investigate factors associated with the duration of viral shedding in patients with COVID-19 outside of Wuhan.
32425636,In this retrospective cohort study, patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Changsha, China were included.
32425636,Clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, treatment and outcome were retrieved.
32425636,Univariable and multivariable analysis were performed to explore potential factors.
32425636,Totally 147 patients with COVID-19 were included.
32425636,The median duration of viral shedding (the number of days from symptoms onset till the successive negative detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA) was 17 days (interquartile range [IQR], 12 to 21).
32425636,Multivariable Logistic regression analysis indicated that the highest temperature at admission (odds ratio [OR], 5.200; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.190-22.726; <i>p</i> = 0.028) and time from symptom onset to admission (OR, 1.740; 95% CI: 1.296-2.337; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and hospital length of stay (OR, 1.604; 95% CI: 1.262-2.040; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) were risk factors for prolonged duration of viral shedding.
32425636,This is the study with relatively large sample size that mainly focused on the duration of viral shedding and relevant factors in patients with COVID-19 outside of Wuhan, China.
32425636,Potential risk factors were identified and should be taken into consideration for the strategy of quarantine of infected patients.
32425638,As of May 11<sup>th</sup> 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the novel, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused 274,361 deaths out of 3,917,366 (7% case fatality rate).
32425638,As with the two other novel coronavirus zoonotic diseases of humans, SARS and MERS, no specific treatments for reducing mortality or morbidity are yet available.
32425638,Deaths from COVID-19 will continue to rise globally until effective and appropriate treatments and vaccines are found.
32425638,With no specific treatments being available for treating COVID-19 patients, the global medical, scientific, pharma and funding communities have rapidly initiated over 500 COVID-19 clinical on a range of antiviral drug regimens, biologics, repurposed drugs in various combinations.
32425638,We focus this editorial specifically on the background to, and the rationale for, the use and evaluation of mesenchymal stromal (Stem) cells (MSCs) in treatment trials of patients with severe COVID-19 disease.
32425638,This is an area which has been eclipsed by the current emphasis the huge number of trials evaluating new anti-viral drugs, repurposed drugs and combinations thereof.
32425638,MSCs should also be trialed for treatment of severe cases of MERS where mortality rates are upto 34% and MERS-CoV remains a WHO priority Blueprint pathogen.
32425638,It's about time funding agencies now invest more into development MSCs per se and other host-directed therapies in combination with other therapeutic interventions.
32425638,MSC therapy could turn out to be an important contribution to bringing an end to the high COVID-19 and MERS death rates.
32425649,From December 2019, a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, caused an outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China and globally.
32425649,However, the clinical characteristics and co-infection with other respiratory pathogens of patients with COVID-19 and the factors associated with severity of COVID-19 are still limited.
32425649,In this retrospective cohort study, we included 354 inpatients with COVID-19 admitted to Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from February 4, 2020 to February 28, 2020.
32425649,We found levels of interleukin-6, interleukin-10, C-reactive protein, D-dimer, white blood cell count and neutrophil count were clearly elevated in males and critical cases compared with females and severe and mild cases, respectively.
32425649,However, lymphopenia was more severe in males than females and levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha were reduced significantly in critical cases than severe and mild cases.
32425649,23.5% of severe cases and 24.4% of critical cases were co-infected with other respiratory pathogens.
32425649,Additionally, stepwise multivariable regression analysis suggested that co-infection, lymphocyte count and levels of D-dimer were associated with severity of COVID-19.
32425649,These findings provide crucial clues for further identification of the mechanisms, characteristics and treatments of patients with COVID-19.
32425651,COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, continues to manifest with severe acute respiratory syndrome among the adults, however, it offers a convincing indication of less severity and fatality in pediatric age group (0-18 years).
32425651,The current trend suggests that children may get infected but are less symptomatic with less fatality, which is concordant to earlier epidemic outbreaks of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, in 2002 and 2012, respectively.
32425651,According to the available data, children appear to be at lower risk for COVID-19, as adults constitute for maximum number of the confirmed cases (308,592) and deaths (13,069) as on 22<sup>nd</sup> March (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus).
32425651,However, rapid publications and information of the adult patients with COVID-19 is in progress and published, on the contrary, almost no comprehensive data or discussion about the COVID-19 in children is available.
32425651,Therefore, in this review, we outline the epidemiology, clinical symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, prevention, possible immune response and role of thymus in children to combat the COVID-19 outbreak.
32425653,Despite its current relatively low global share of cases and deaths in Africa compared to other regions, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has the potential to trigger other larger crises in the region.
32425653,This is due to the vulnerability of health and economic systems, coupled with the high burden of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), tuberculosis (TB), and malaria.
32425653,Here we examine the potential implications of COVID-19 on the control of these major epidemic diseases in Africa.
32425653,We use current evidence on disease burden of HIV, TB, and malaria, and epidemic dynamics of COVID-19 in Africa, retrieved from the literature.
32425653,Our analysis shows that the current measures to control COVID-19 neglect important and complex context-specific epidemiological, social, and economic realities in Africa.
32425653,There is a similarity of clinical features of TB and malaria, with those used to track COVID-19 cases.
32425653,This coupled with institutional mistrust and misinformation might result in many patients with clinical features similar to those of COVID-19 being hesitant to voluntarily seek care in a formal health facility.
32425653,Furthermore, most people in productive age in Africa work in the informal sector, and most of those in the formal sector are underemployed.
32425653,With the current measures to control COVID-19, these populations might face unprecedented difficulties to access essential services, mainly due to reduced ability of patients to support direct and indirect medical costs, and unavailability of transportation means to reach health facilities.
32425653,Therefore, if not accompanied with appropriate economic and epidemiological considerations, we anticipate that these measures might result in unprecedented difficulties among vulnerable segments of society to access essential services, including antiretroviral and prophylactic drugs among people living with HIV and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, anti-tuberculosis drugs, and curative and preventive treatments for malaria among pregnant women and children.
32425653,This might increase the propensity of patients taking substandard doses and/or medicines, which has the potential to compromise drug efficacy, and worsen health inequalities in the region.
32425653,COVID-19 responses at country level should include measures to protect vulnerable and under-served segments of society.
32425655,On March 29th 2020, 97,689 cases of COVID-19 have been diagnosed only in Italy, with 73,880 actually positive cases, a daily increase of 3815 cases, 27,386 hospitalized and 3906 patients in intensive care units, causing a total of 10,779 known deaths.
32425655,In all urological departments, quickly inpatient and outpatient services have been significantly reduced.
32425655,Even in this COVID-19 situation, urological neoplasm care must go on, but significant changes need to be made in the way some care is delivered.
32425655,We compared diagnostic and therapeutic elective procedures requested and performed for PC management from our multidisciplinary team (MDT) during 1 month activity in the highest national level of COVID-19 infection (March 2020) and under restrictions for all the population, with the management performed in a no-COVID-19 month (March 2019) 1 year ago.
32425655,The only management that did not received a significant reduction are medical therapies for advanced hormone sensitive (HS) or castration resistant (CR) PC.
32425655,We describe our MDT identifications of elective undeferrable PC management in this COVID-19 time.
32425655,These suggestions have been considered for a country (ITALY) under a rapid increase of COVID-19 cases and complications, but in a region with an actual lower impact (2914 actual positive and 1079 hospitalized cases) from the infection and in an hospital not completely converted to COVID-19 management.
32425655,Indications should be different and restricted only to emergencies on the basis of COVID-19 pandemic situation and hospital involvement.
32425658,To model the effects of continuous, intermittent, and stepping-down social distancing (SD) strategies and personal protection measures on COVID-19 transmission dynamics.
32425658,Constant, intermittent, and stepping-down SD strategies were modeled at 4 mean magnitudes (5%, 10 %, 15 % and 20 %), 2 time windows (40-days, 80-days), and 2 levels of personal caution (30 % and 50 %).
32425658,The stepping-down strategy was the best long-term SD strategy to minimize the peak number of active COVID-19 cases and associated deaths.
32425658,The stepping-down strategy also resulted in a reduction in total time required to SD over a two-year period by 6.5 % compared to an intermittent or constant SD strategy.
32425658,An 80-day SD time-window was statistically more effective in maintaining control over the COVID-19 pandemic than a 40-day window.
32425658,However, the results were dependent upon 50 % of people being cautious (engaging in personal protection measures).
32425658,If people exercise caution while in public by protecting themselves (e.g., wearing a facemask, proper hand hygiene and avoid agglomeration) the magnitude and duration of SD necessary to maintain control over the pandemic can be reduced.
32425658,Our models suggest that the most effective way to reduce SD over a two-year period is a stepping-down approach every 80 days.
32425658,According to our model, this method would prevent a second peak and the number of intensive care units needed per day would be within the threshold of those currently available.
32425659,Novel coronavirus has wrecked medical and health care facilities claiming ∼5% death tollsglobally.
32425659,All efforts to contain the pathogenesis either using inhibitory drugs or vaccines largelyremained futile due to a lack of better understanding of the genomic feature of this virus.
32425659,In thepresent study, we compared the 2019-nCoV with other coronaviruses, which indicated that batSARS like coronavirus could be a probable ancestor of the novel coronavirus.
32425659,The proteinsequence similarity of pangolin-hCoV and bat-hCoV with human coronavirus was higher ascompared to their nucleotide similarity denoting the occurrence of more synonymous mutationsin the genome.
32425659,Phylogenetic and alignment analysis of 591 novel coronaviruses of differentclades from Group I to Group V revealed several mutations and concomitant amino acidchanges.
32425659,Detailed investigation on nucleotide substitution unfolded 100 substitutions in thecoding region of which 43 were synonymous and 57 were of non-synonymous type.
32425659,The nonsynonymous substitutions resulting into 57 amino acid changes were found to be distributed overdifferent hCoV proteins with maximum on spike protein.
32425659,An important di-amino acid change RGto KR was observed in ORF9 protein.
32425659,Additionally, several interesting features of the novelcoronavirus genome have been highlighted in respect to various other human infecting viruseswhich may explain extreme pathogenicity, infectivity and simultaneously the reason behindfailure of the antiviral therapies.
32425659,SUMMARY: This study presents a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV2 isolates to understand discrete mutations that are occurring between patient samples.
32425659,The analysis unravel various amino acid mutations in the viral proteins which may provide an explanation for varying treatment efficacies of different inhibitory drugs and a future direction towards a combinatorial treatment therapies based on the kind of mutation in the viral genome.
32425662,Approximately 5% of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) develop a life-threatening pneumonia that often occurs in the setting of increased inflammation or &quot;cytokine storm&quot;.
32425662,Anti-cytokine treatments are being evaluated but optimal patient selection remains unclear, and the aim of our study is to address this point.
32425662,Between February 29 to April 6, 2020, 111 consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated in a single centre retrospective study.
32425662,Patients were divided in two groups: 42 severe cases (TOCI) with adverse prognostic features including raised CRP and IL-6 levels, who underwent anti-cytokine treatments, mostly tocilizumab, and 69 standard of care patients (SOC).
32425662,In the TOCI group, all received anti-viral therapy and 40% also received glucocorticoids.
32425662,In TOCI, 62% of cases were ventilated and there were 3 deaths (17.8 ± 10.6 days, mean follow up) with 7/26 cases remaining on ventilators, without improvement, and 17/26 developed bacterial superinfection.
32425662,One fatality occurred in the 15 TOCI cases treated on noninvasive ventilation and 1 serious bacterial superinfection.
32425662,Of the 69 cases in SOC, there was no fatalities and no bacterial complications.
32425662,The TOCI group had higher baseline CRP and IL-6 elevations (p &lt; 0.0001 for both) and higher neutrophils and lower lymphocyte levels (p = 0.04 and p = 0.001, respectively) with the TOCI ventilated patients having higher markers than non-ventilated TOCI patients.
32425662,Higher inflammatory markers, more infections and worse outcomes characterized ventilated TOCI cases compared to ward based TOCI.
32425662,Despite the confounding factors, this suggests that therapy time in anti-cytokine randomized trials will be key.
32425701,The factors mediating fatal SARS-CoV-2 infections are poorly understood.
32425701,Here, we show that cigarette smoke causes a dose-dependent upregulation of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, in rodent and human lungs.
32425701,Using single-cell sequencing data, we demonstrate that ACE2 is expressed in a subset of secretory cells in the respiratory tract.
32425701,Chronic smoke exposure triggers the expansion of this cell population and a concomitant increase in ACE2 expression.
32425701,In contrast, quitting smoking decreases the abundance of these secretory cells and reduces ACE2 levels.
32425701,Finally, we demonstrate that ACE2 expression is responsive to inflammatory signaling and can be upregulated by viral infections or interferon treatment.
32425701,Taken together, these results may partially explain why smokers are particularly susceptible to severe SARS-CoV-2 infections.
32425701,Furthermore, our work identifies ACE2 as an interferon-stimulated gene in lung cells, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infections could create positive-feedback loops that increase ACE2 levels and facilitate viral dissemination.
32425713,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an ongoing pandemic having caused a major health care crises across the globe.Pharmacy professionals are considered vital in preparation for optimal response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
32425713,Therefore, in response to the estimated potential impact of COVID-19 on Johns Hopkins Aramco Healthcare (joint venture between Saudi Aramco and Johns Hopkins Medicine International), several initiatives were taken by the hospital's inpatient pharmacy department with focus on infection control, staffing, meeting clinical operational challenges, ethics, increased utilization of automation, and maintenance of employee wellness to prepare for this challenge.
32425713,The plan implemented by the inpatient pharmacy department was prepared while incorporating information and recommendations from leading pharmacy organizations, ministry of health, institute's experience in battling another similar coronavirus (the Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus) previously, and updated scientific research.
32425713,The key focus areas include development of an institutionalized COVID-19 protocol, measures to improve infection control when handling and dispensing medications, modified staffing plan, system changes in peri-operative areas, keeping pharmacy professionals updated about new and scientific researches, increased utilization of automation, clinical interventions by pharmacist ensuring appropriate utilization of medications while monitoring for drug-drug interactions, adverse drug event prevention, and preparing for handling drug shortages.
32425713,By implementing a robust plan, pharmacy professionals continue to show that they are an integral member of inter-professional health care teams.
32425731,Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes severe complications and deaths all over the world.
32425731,COVID-19 also has indirect effects from the lockdown and the possible lack of food.
32425731,We aimed to evaluate the perception of this in Celiac Disease (CeD) patients who require a lifelong gluten-free diet as a therapy.
32425731,We invited by e-mail CeD adult patients from the University of Salerno (Campania, South Italy) and the University of Padua (Veneto, North Italy) to answer an <i>ad hoc</i> COVID-19 survey.
32425731,We sent the web survey to 651 email addresses and we received 276 answers (42,4%).
32425731,CeD patients did not feel more vulnerable because they had CeD <i>(not at all</i> 56.6%)and they did not worry much about the possible shortness of gluten-free food during the epidemic(<i>not at all 48.5%)</i>The most worried were the elderly patients, patients with other comorbidities and females.
32425731,Finally, CeD patients were happy with remote consultations and explicitly asked to have them.
32425731,The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted a proportion of patients with CeD; in particular, women, elderly patients, patients with other comorbidities.
32425731,COVID-19, although a challenging experience from the medical and the psychological point of view, has offered an opportunity to practice, on a large-scale, a remote consultation approach for CeD healthcare.
32425880,COVID-19 has rapidly become a pandemic emergency, distressing health systems in each affected country.
32425880,COVID-19 determines the need for healthcare in a large number of people in an extremely short time and, like a tsunami wave, overruns emergency, infectious diseases, and pneumology departments as well as intensive care units, choking healthcare services.
32425880,Rehabilitation services are also affected by this epidemic which forces radical changes both in the organization and in the operating methods.
32425880,In the absence of reference literature on this issue, this report aims to provide a background documentation to support physicians and healthcare personnel involved in neurorehabilitation and rehabilitation care.
32425991,The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses a serious threat to healthcare systems globally.
32425991,Information regarding to the how the infection affects the liver and relevance of pre-existing liver disease as a risk factor for acquiring the infection or having a severe disease are still scarce.
32425991,Also, considerations to be considered in liver transplant patients or those having hepatocellular carcinoma or are under immunosuppressive therapy are being matter of analysis as information is being generated.
32425991,Different treatments for COVID-19 are currently under study some of which may be associated to hepatotoxicity.
32425991,In the present review we discuss current data on the COVID-19 and liver aiming to provide hepatologists with updated information to face this pandemic.
32425996,Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in late December 2019, it has brought significant harm and challenges to over 200 countries and regions around the world.
32425996,However, there is increasing evidence that many patients with COVID-19 are asymptomatic or have only mild symptoms, but they are able to transmit the virus to others.
32425996,There are difficulties in screening for asymptomatic infections, which makes it more difficult for national prevention and control of this epidemic.
32425996,This article reviews the characteristics, treatment, and outcomes of asymptomatic infections with COVID-19, hoping it would be helpful for early prevention and control of this severe public health threat worldwide.
32426001,COVID-19 is a newly emerged disease that has become a global public health challenge.
32426001,Due to a lack of knowledge about the virus, a significant number of potential targets for using a particular drug have been proposed.
32426001,Five cases with a clinical history of biopolymers in the gluteal region that developed iatrogenic allogenosis (IA) are presented here.
32426001,The 5 cases were put under colchicine treatment for IA crisis and had non-specific symptoms (headache, cough without dyspnoea, and arthralgias) with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test.
32426001,Their close contacts had mild to severe symptoms and three of them died.
32426001,In the SARS-CoV-2 infection different inflammatory pathways are altered where colchicine reduces cytokine levels as well as the activation of macrophages, neutrophils, and the inflammasome.
32426001,The possible mechanisms that colchicine may use to prevent acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in patients with COVID-19 infection are also reviewed in this article.
32426002,The novel SARS-CoV-2 human coronavirus in Wuhan, China, has triggered a worldwide respiratory disease outbreak (COVID-19).
32426002,Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiorgan dysfunction and thrombotic events are among the leading causes of death in critically ill patients with COVID-19.
32426002,The elevated inflammatory cytokines suggest that a &quot;cytokine storm&quot;, also known as cytokine release syndrome (CRS), may play a major role in the pathology of COVID-19.
32426002,In addition to anti-viral therapy and supportive treatment in critically ill patients, unique medications for this condition are also under investigation.
32426002,Here we reviewed therapeutic options, including the antibody therapy that might be an immediate strategy for SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
32426020,Although Singapore was one of the first countries outside of China to be affected by COVID-19, for the first 2.5 months since its first reported case on January 23, 2020, it remained one of the few nations with successful containment of spread of the pandemic with little mortality and zero intra-hospital transmissions, without instituting a major lockdown of the country.
32426020,In times of an infectious epidemic where medical subspecialties lead the frontline, a surgeon's role becomes rather vague.
32426020,However, the only obstacle that stands in between the surgeon and fighting in the frontline of an infectious disease outbreak, is the traditional perception of what a surgeon can do.
32426020,By presenting the strategies employed by our institution and its surgical unit, which remains the epicenter of the COVID-19 fight in Singapore, together with our medical counterparts, we hope to be able to improve our practices to respond and prevent the pandemic from escalating further as a collective community of surgeons across the globe.
32426020,Contingencies should be in place for prioritization of existing patients, triaging and treatment of suspected patients, infection control, manpower management and novel strategies for inter-disciplinary communications and education in a hospital's surgical unit during a pandemic.
32426020,Working in a high risk environment with manpower and resource limitations for prolonged periods of time has effect on morale and affects surgeon burn-out.
32426020,Transparent communication, avenues to address psychological needs of surgeons and leadership by example are key strategies in ensuring a sustainable fight against the pandemic.
32426020,With the varies strategies implemented, every surgical discipline and every surgeon should be unified and place their desire to operate aside.
32426020,There should not be any differentiation between surgeon and physician, but instead, everyone has to work together as one united health care front battling the common enemy - COVID-19.
32426089,Spring and Summer 2020 are unique in that the challenges of care for those suffering from pollen allergy coincide with the COVID-19 pandemic.
32426089,Several considerations are important to allow optimal care of allergic rhinitis (AR) and asthma and hence prevention of coronavirus spread through sneezing, rhinorrhoea and coughing.
32426089,This compact overview of recommendations by the EUFOREA expert teams on allergic airway diseases and AIT is based on investigation of the current COVID-19 literature in association with the key words above and shared clinical experience of the experts involved.
32426089,It deals with similarities and differences between AR and coronavirus infection, specific recommendations for allergic disease care in the COVID-19 era, including guidance on allergen specific immunotherapy, AIT.
32426090,Managing patients with severe asthma during the coronavirus pandemic COVID-19 is a challenge.
32426090,Authorities and physicians are still learning how COVID-19 affects people with underlying diseases, and severe asthma is not an exception.
32426090,Unless relevant data emerges that changes our understanding of the relative safety of medications indicated in patients with asthma during this pandemic, clinicians must follow the recommendations of current evidence-based guidelines, preventing loss of control and exacerbations.
32426090,Also, with the absence of data that would indicate any potential harm, current advice is to continue the administration of biologic agents during the COVID-19 pandemic in patients with asthma for whom such agents are clearly indicated and have been effective.
32426090,For the patients with severe asthma infected by SARS-CoV-2, the decision to maintain or postpone biologic therapy until the patient recovers should be a case-by-case based decision supported by a multidisciplinary team.
32426090,A registry of cases of COVID-19 in patients with severe asthma, including those treated with biologics, will help to address a clinical challenge where we have more questions than answers.
32426099,With health care funders' increasing approval of telehealth service as an emergency measure to provide continuity of care during the COVID-19 crisis, practicing behavior analysts have an unprecedented opportunity to demonstrate that essential, medically necessary behavior-analytic services can be provided via telehealth in a manner that maintains treatment integrity and produces meaningful client outcomes.
32426099,This telehealth treatment selection guide was designed to assist practicing behavior analysts in determining an appropriate protocol for the delivery of 1:1 telehealth service (i.e., a behavior technician providing instruction directly to a client, with or without the assistance of the client's caregiver, through videoconferencing).
32426099,This tool aims to help behavior analysts make thoughtful clinical decisions to maintain continuity of care for the vulnerable population with autism spectrum disorders, while adhering to safety measures that provide protection to society.
32426111,The COVID-19 pandemic presents many unique challenges when caring for patients with pulmonary hypertension.
32426111,The COVID-19 pandemic has altered routine standard of care practice and the acute management particularly for those patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, where pulmonary arterial hypertension-specific treatments are used.
32426111,It is important to balance the ongoing care and evaluation of pulmonary arterial hypertension patients with &quot;exposure risk&quot; to COVID-19 for patients coming to clinic or the hospital.
32426111,If there is a morbidity and mortality benefit from starting pulmonary arterial hypertension therapies, for example in a patient with high-likelihood of pulmonary arterial hypertension, then it remains important to complete the thorough evaluation.
32426111,However, the COVID-19 outbreak may also represent a unique time when pulmonary hypertension experts have to weigh the risks and benefits of the diagnostic work-up including potential exposure to COVID-19 versus initiating targeted pulmonary arterial hypertension therapy in a select high-risk, high likelihood World Symposium Pulmonary Hypertension Group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension patients.
32426111,This document will highlight some of the issues facing providers, patients, and the pulmonary arterial hypertension community in real-time as the COVID-19 pandemic is evolving and is intended to share expected common clinical scenarios and best clinical practices to help the community at-large.
32426200,The novel coronavirus has challenged medical systems worldwide to provide optimal medical care in the setting of limited resources.
32426200,Although we are uncovering many facets of its disease spectrum, with rapidly emerging data, there is still limited knowledge of the sequelae of this infection, making treatment guidelines incomplete and resulting in serious unpredictable outcomes in patients at seemingly low risk, especially ones afflicted by neurological consequences.
32426200,We present a case of a cortical stroke in a 31-year-old coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) positive female with otherwise no stroke risk factors.
32426200,We noted a correlation between cytokine release, encephalopathy, and the onset of stroke symptoms.
32426200,Patients with marked pro-thrombotic and inflammatory markers may benefit from closer neurological monitoring and thromboprophylaxis at therapeutic doses.
32426200,The establishment of acute care pathways to manage critically ill patients with neurological consequences may reverse the suboptimal outcome trends seen during the pandemic.
32426209,<b>:</b> The Coronavirus (COVID-19), (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)) has been spreading worldwide since its first identification in China.
32426209,It has been speculated that patients with comorbidities and elderly patients could be at high risk for the pandemic reasoned respiratory insufficiency and death.
32426209,At first, it was thought that the patients who use immunmodulator therapy could be even at higher risks of disease complications.
32426209,However, it has been also speculated about that using immunmodulators could be an advantage for the clinical prognosis.
32426209,Therefore, several immunmodulators are currently being tested as potential treatment for COVID-19. : In this paper we report on a patient that has been treated with type 1 interferon for multiple sclerosis who developed COVID-19. : Despite using immunmodulator, the symptoms of the patient at hospitalization were mild and he did not show elevated D-dimer, and there was no lymphopenia.
32426209,He was discharged to home-quarantine with no symptoms. : This report supports the idea of using type 1 interferon in the treatment could be effective in COVID-19 affected patients.
32426220,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic has resulted in diversion of healthcare resources to the management of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus.
32426220,Elective interventions and surgical procedures in most countries have been postponed and operating room resources have been diverted to manage the pandemic.
32426220,The Venous and Lymphatic Triage and Acuity Scale (VELTAS) was developed to provide an international standard to rationalise and harmonise the management of patients with venous and lymphatic disorders or vascular anomalies.
32426220,Triage urgency was determined based on clinical assessment of urgency with which a patient would require medical treatment or surgical intervention.
32426220,Clinical conditions were classified into six categories of: 1) Venous thromboembolism (VTE), 2) Chronic Venous Disease (CVD), 3) Vascular anomalies, 4) Venous trauma 5) Venous compression and 6) Lymphatic disease.
32426220,Triage urgency was categorised into four groups and individual conditions were allocated to each class of triage.
32426220,These included 1) Medical Emergencies (requiring immediate attendance), example massive pulmonary embolism; 2) Urgent (to be seen as soon as possible), example deep vein thrombosis ; 3) Semi-urgent (to be attended to within 30-90 days), example highly symptomatic CVD, and 4) Discretionary/Non-urgent- (to be seen within 6-12 months), example chronic lymphoedema.
32426220,VELTAS aims to standardise the triage of patients with venous and lymphatic disease or vascular anomalies by providing an international consensus-based classification of clinical categories and triage urgency.
32426220,The scale may be used during pandemics such as the current COVID-19 crisis but may also be used as a general framework to classify urgency of the listed conditions.
32426231,We report on a 33-year old Polish truck driver who was admitted as a COVID-19 suspicion case to our hospital after a short stay in northern Italy and was eventually diagnosed with fulminant Capnocytophaga canimorsus sepsis.
32426231,In retrospect, the patient always had his dog with him in the truck cab and was regularly licked in the face.
32426231,Following adequate therapy, the patient recovered completely after 8 weeks and was discharged from the hospital in good general condition.
32426243,Remdesivir is a novel therapeutic with known activity against SARS CoV-2 and related coronaviruses.
32426243,Remdesivir, as well as convalescent plasma therapy, are currently under investigation as potential therapies for patients with Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19).
32426243,In this case report we summarize the use of convalescent plasma therapy and then remdesivir as a late addition in the treatment of a critically ill obstetric patient with COVID-19.
32426243,The patient subsequently improved, was extubated 5 days after initiation of remdesivir, was transitioned to room air 24 h later, and discharged at the completion of remdesivir therapy.
32426285,Italy is the European country that was hit first and hardest by the COVID-19 epidemic.
32426285,Since February 2020, the outbreak of the epidemic disease in Italy, with fatal outcomes in up to 10% of cases, made it urgent to implement extraordinary measures to avoid a breakdown of the universal Italian national health system.
32426285,The update for April 1, 2020, in Italy recorded 102,669 confirmed COVID-19 cases, with a median patient age of 63 years.
32426285,The deceased patients were older people (median age 80 years) and often had a cancer diagnosis (about 20%).
32426285,Thus, in the extraordinary epidemiological scenario of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy, older persons in cancer treatment are at particularly high risk of being severely affected by COVID-19.
32426285,These people face a health- and economics-related emergency that also carries cultural and ethical implications.
32426285,In accordance with the measures adopted by the Italian government to limit viral transmission, several associations of Italian oncologists have taken action to update Elderly Cancer Care programs.
32426285,In view of the newly emerging needs, we herein outline practical suggestions aimed at guaranteeing the best continuity to elderly cancer patients.
32426292,The global COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted healthcare delivery, particularly for patients with advanced lung cancer.
32426292,While certain aspects of care can be safely omitted or delayed, systemic therapy plays an important role in survival and quality of life for patients with advanced lung cancer; limiting access to systemic therapy will compromise cancer-related outcomes.
32426292,This can be at odds with strategies to mitigate risk of COVID-19 exposure, which include reducing hospital and clinic visits.
32426292,One important strategy is implementation of oral cancer therapies.
32426292,Many standard regimens require intravenous infusions but there are specific circumstances where an oral agent could be an acceptable alternative.
32426292,Integrating oral therapeutics can permit patients to receive effective systemic treatment without the exposure risks associated with frequent infusions.
32426292,Here, we review currently available oral cytotoxic agents with a potential role in the treatment of lung cancer.
32426362,Italy was the second country in the world to face a wide epidemic of Covid-19 after China.
32426362,The ratio of the number of fatalities to the number of cases (case fatality ratio, CFR) recorded in Italy was surprisingly high and increased in the month of March.
32426362,The older mean age of population, the changes in testing policy, and the methodological computation of CFR were previously reported as possible explanations for the incremental trend of CFR, a parameter theoretically expected to be constant.
32426362,In this brief report, the official data provided by the Italian Ministry of Health were analyzed using fitting models and the linear fit method approach.
32426362,This last methodology allowed us to reach two findings.
32426362,The trend of the number of deaths followed a 1-3-day delay of positive cases.
32426362,This delay was not compatible with a biological course of Covid-19 but was compatible with a health management explanation.
32426362,The second finding is that the Italian number of deaths did not increase linearly with the number of positive cases, but their relationship could be modeled by a second-order polynomial function.
32426362,The high number of positive cases might have a direct and an indirect effect on the number of deaths, the latter being related to the overwhelmed bed capacity of intensive care units.
32426374,In December 2019, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2, occurred in China and has currently led to a global pandemic.
32426374,In addition to respiratory involvement, COVID-19 was also associated with significant multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).
32426374,Cardiovascular impairment has been observed and is now drawing growing attention.
32426374,Cardiovascular protective strategies are urgent and of great significance to the overall prognosis of COVID-19 patients.
32426374,Direct viral infection, cytokine storm, and aggravation of existing cardiovascular diseases were recognized as possible mechanisms of cardiovascular impairment in COVID-19.
32426374,Hyperactivated inflammation plays an important role in all three mechanisms and is considered to be fundamental in the development of cardiovascular impairment and MODS in COVID-19.
32426374,Therefore, in addition to conventional cardiovascular treatment, anti-inflammatory therapy is a reasonable strategy for severe cases to further enhance cardiovascular protection and potentially mitigate MODS.
32426374,We reviewed the inflammatory features and current promising treatments of COVID-19 as well as cardiovascular anti-inflammatory therapies that have been verified in previous clinical trials with positive outcomes.
32426374,We believe that targeting the central pathway (IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6), balancing the Th1 and Th2 response, and administering long-term anti-inflammatory therapy might be promising prospects to reduce cardiovascular impairment and even MODS during the acute and recovery phases of COVID-19.
32426374,The cardiovascular anti-inflammatory therapies might be of great application value to the management of COVID-19 patients and we further propose an algorithm for the selection of anti-inflammatory therapy for COVID-19 patients with or at high risk of cardiovascular impairment.
32426374,We recommend to take the experiences in cardiovascular anti-inflammatory therapy as references in the management of COVID-19 and conduct related clinical trials, while the clinical translation of novel treatments from preclinical studies or <i>in vitro</i> drug screening should proceed with caution due to unguaranteed efficacy and safety profiles.
32426388,The present study demonstrates the potential of flavanoid narcissoside against the novel corona virus (COVID-19) complications using molecular docking studies.
32426388,The computation molecular docking screening was performed using Molegro Virtual Docker software (MVD) with grid resolution of 30 Å.
32426388,Protein of COVID 19 virus was taken from protein data bank.
32426388,The standard inhibitor X77 (N-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-N-[(1R)-2-(cyclohexylamino)-2-oxo-1-(pyridin-3-yl)ethyl]-1H-imidazole-4-carboxamide) identified from the protein inhibitor complex 6W63 from protein data bank was docked with COVID 19 protein 6W63 which showed MolDock score of -156.913, rerank Sore -121.296 and H Bond -5.7369, while the flavanoid narcissoside had showed MolDock score -180.739, Rerank Sore -137.092 and H Bond -18.6771.
32426388,The narcissoside showed potent inhibitory effect which is greater than standard X77.
32426388,The result showed that narcissoside have high affinity towards 6W63 as it showed thirteen hydrogen bonds with nine amino acids (Arg 188, Glu 166, His 164, Cys 145 (2 bonds), Asn 14 (2 bonds), Cys 44 (2 bonds), His 41 (2 bonds), Gln 192, Thr 190) while <b>X777</b> showed four hydrogen bonds with amino acids (Gly 143, Cys 145, Glu 166, Ser 144).
32426388,From computation approach it was concluded that narcissoside is a potent inhibitor of viral COVID 19 protein 6W63.
32426388,The narcissoside have high affinity and inhibition potential than standard inhibitor X77 (N-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-N-[(1R)-2-(cyclohexylamino)-2-oxo-1-(pyridin-3-yl)ethyl]-1H-imidazole-4-carboxamide).
32426388,The narcissoside predicted as more potent inhibitor which can be further optimize, pharmacologically and clinically evaluated for the treatment of novel coronavirus COVID-19.
32426441,Relying on capacity increases and patient transfers to deal with the huge and continuous inflow of COVID-19 critically ill patients is a strategy limited by finite human and logistical resources.
32426441,Prioritising both critical care initiation and continuation is paramount to save the greatest number of lives.
32426441,It enables to allocate scarce resources in priority to those with the highest probability of benefiting from them.
32426441,It is fully ethical provided it relies on objective and widely shared criteria, thus preventing arbitrary decisions and guaranteeing equity.
32426441,Prioritisation seeks to fairly allocate treatments, maximise saved lives, gain indirect life benefits from prioritising exposed healthcare and similar workers, give priority to those most penalised as a last resort, and apply similar prioritisation schemes to all patients.
32426441,Prioritisation schemes and their criteria are adjusted to the level of resource scarcity: strain (level A) or saturation (level B).
32426441,Prioritisation yields a four level priority for initiation or continuation of critical care: P1 - high priority, P2 - intermediate priority, P3 - not needed, P4 - not appropriate.
32426441,Prioritisation schemes take into account the patient's wishes, clinical frailty, pre-existing chronic condition, along with severity and evolution of acute condition.
32426441,Initial priority level must be reassessed, at least after 48 h once missing decision elements are available, at the typical turning point in the disease's natural history (ICU days 7 to 10 for COVID-19), and each time resource scarcity levels change.
32426441,For treatments to be withheld or withdrawn, a collegial decision-making process and information of patient and/or next of kin are paramount.
32426441,Prioritisation strategy is bound to evolve with new knowledge and with changes within the epidemiological situation.
32426556,The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has significantly impacted healthcare delivery around the world.
32426556,Elective procedures and routine follow-ups have been cancelled and/or converted to tele-health visits by many systems.
32426556,In this article, we focus on recommendations for the surveillance of head and neck cancer patients during and following radiotherapy treatment.
32426556,We synthesized information from clinical evidence, existing recommendations from the NCCN, and variations in practice between multiple academic tertiary cancer centers to develop the proposed guidance.
32426749,Endemic and pandemic viral respiratory infections have recently emerged as a critical topic of investigation given the recent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 outbreak.
32426749,Data from such outbreaks indicate that severe systemic comorbidities including acute neurologic illness are associated with illness and lead to significant outcome differences.
32426749,Herein, we will discuss the neurologic manifestations of severe viral respiratory infections including coronavirus, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, metapneumovirus, and enterovirus.
32426749,PubMed and EMBASE were searched by two independent investigators up to March 2020.
32426749,Data selection included preclinical and clinical studies detailing neurologic manifestations of viral respiratory infections.
32426749,Two independent investigators reviewed and extracted the data.
32426749,Neurologic manifestations including seizures, status epilepticus, encephalitis, critical illness neuromyopathy, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, acute necrotizing encephalitis, Guillan-Barré syndrome, transverse myelitis, and acute flaccid myelitis have all been associated with severe viral respiratory infections.
32426749,Having an understanding of the direct neurotropism of such viruses is imperative to understanding pathogenesis, clinical presentation, and potential treatment paradigms aimed at improving morbidity and mortality.
32426754,The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has disproportionally strained intensive care services worldwide.
32426754,Large areas of uncertainly regarding epidemiology, physiology, practice patterns, and resource demands for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 require rapid collection and dissemination of data.
32426754,We describe the conception and implementation of an intensive care database rapidly developed and designed to meet data analytic needs in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic-the multicenter, international Society of Critical Care Medicine Discovery Network Viral Infection and Respiratory Illness Universal Study.
32426754,Prospective cohort study and disease registry.
32426754,Multinational cohort of ICUs.
32426754,Critically ill patients with a diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019.
32426754,None.
32426754,Within 2 weeks of conception of the Society of Critical Care Medicine Discovery Network Viral Infection and Respiratory Illness Universal Study, study leadership was convened, registry case report forms were designed, electronic data entry set up, and more than 250 centers had submitted the protocol for institutional review board approval, with more than 100 cases entered.
32426754,The Society of Critical Care Medicine Discovery Network Viral Infection and Respiratory Illness Universal Study provides an example of a rapidly deployed, international, pandemic registry that seeks to provide near real-time analytics and information regarding intensive care treatments and outcomes for patients with coronavirus disease 2019.
32426877,Melanoma epidemiology has shown a constant increase in the last few decades even if mortality is low and only a small percentage of patients develop metastatic disease.
32426877,For these patients, immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) significantly improves disease outcome with a median survival more than 2 years.
32426877,The same drugs are used as adjuvant treatment in disease-free patients.
32426877,Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) is now a pandemic disease with lung manifestations, which can bring severe acute respiratory distress.
32426877,The most important risk factors related to a higher death risk for COVID-19 pneumonia are elderly age and comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, previous cancer).
32426890,Since the COVID-19 pandemic stormed into the healthcare systems worldwide, protected stroke pathways have been suggested, in order not to spread the viral infection and ensure hyper-acute treatment.
32426890,Noteworthy, patients with acute ischemic stroke are at high-risk for contracting SARS-CoV-2 virus, particularly the severe form, because COVID-19 and cerebrovascular diseases share common risk factors.
32426890,Conversely, among patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 respiratory distress, about 5% might suffer a stroke.
32426890,During the acute stages of the pandemic, thousands of healthcare professionals have already contracted COVID-19 infection, although the actual number is likely to be higher because healthcare workers are not always tested and protection measures at hospitals are not always readily available.
32426890,This is the setting in which neurovascular ultrasound providers (physicians, sonographers) should expect to be involved in the care of stroke patients.
32426897,A prominent clinical feature of severe Covid-19 infection is respiratory failure associated with pulmonary coagulopathy.
32426897,Recent reports published in Thrombosis and Haemostasis show that treatment with low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) decreases mortality in critically ill patients with sepsis-induced hypercoagulation, and thus argue for prophylactic administration of the anticoagulant.
32426897,In addition, the authors point to non-anticoagulant activities of heparin, in particular anti-inflammatory effects with potential to prevent deterioration of the disease.
32426897,We would like to use this opportunity to clarify the biochemical background of the diverse activities of heparin, and further, how this information may be exploited to generate more efficient treatment of the viral infection.
32426897,Mechanisms to consider relate to the functional roles of proteins interacting with heparan sulfate (HS), a polysaccharide closely related to heparin.
32426957,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease that became a global health emergency.
32426957,The paper reviews aspects of COVID-19 that pertain to rheumatology, including symptoms and signs akin to those observed in rheumatic disorders, risk of infection or severe course of the disease in patients with a pre-existing rheumatic disease and those receiving antirheumatic or immunosuppressive medication as well as potential applications of antirheumatic or anticytokine therapeutic strategies that are already applied in rheumatology (including chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab, baricitinib, and others) for patients with COVID-19.
32427000,<b> <i>Objective:</i> </b> The aim of this study was to provide recommendations for improving the design of subsequent studies through analysis of the registered coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) clinical trials.<b> <i>Methods:</i> </b> A retrospective analysis of 189 trials retrievals achieved on February 20, 2020.<b> <i>Results:</i> </b> A total of 189 trials are included in the study.
32427000,There were 69.3% interventional studies, 21.7% observational studies, 5.3% diagnostic tests, and 3.7% other studies.
32427000,The following statistics are provided only for the interventional studies.
32427000,Severity of disease: 5.3% light and common type, 17.6% severe and critically ill, and 59.6% with no restricted classification.
32427000,Medication use: 51.1% Western medicine, 32.1% Chinese medicine, 10.7% blood related product, and 6.1% non-drug therapy.
32427000,The median and inner quantile range of the sample sizes included in these studies: 104 (IQR: 60, 200).
32427000,Primary outcome type most used: 45.8% with clinical characteristics and 21.4% with virological.
32427000,Study design characteristics: 71% of all studies were randomized, 5% of all studies were blinded, 18% of all studies were multicenter, and 76% of all studies were single-center.<b> <i>Conclusion:</i> </b> Although many COVID-19 studies include randomization in their design, the lack of additional double-blind and placebo-controlled elements in their designs result in a less robust evaluation of intervention safety and efficacy.
32427000,Furthermore, similar or repeated research and small sample studies that have less promise in gains of new information have possibly led to a shortage of recruitable patients and become a barrier to the completion of large multicenter clinical trial studies.
32427134,This review intends to provide an overview of the current knowledge on neurologic sequelae of COVID-19 and their possible etiology, and, based on available data, proposes possible improvements in current medical care procedures.
32427134,We conducted a thorough review of the scientific literature on neurologic manifestations of COVID-19, the neuroinvasive propensity of known coronaviruses (CoV) and their possible effects on brain structural and functional integrity.
32427134,It appears that around one third of COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU) for respiratory difficulties exhibit neurologic symptoms.
32427134,This may be due to progressive brain damage and dysfunction triggered by severe hypoxia and hypoxemia, heightened inflammation and SARS-CoV-2 dissemination into brain parenchyma, as suggested by current reports and analyses of previous CoV outbreaks.
32427134,Viral invasion of the brain may particularly target and alter brainstem and thalamic functions and, consequently, result in sensorimotor dysfunctions and psychiatric disorders.
32427134,Moreover, data collected from other structurally homologous CoV suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection may lead to brain cell degeneration and demyelination similar to multiple sclerosis (MS).
32427134,Hence, current evidence warrants further evaluation and long-term follow-up of possible neurologic sequelae in COVID-19 patients.
32427134,It may be particularly relevant to evaluate brainstem integrity in recovered patients, as it is suspected that this cerebral area may particularly be dysfunctional following SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32427134,Because CoV infection can potentially lead to chronic neuroinflammation and progressive demyelination, neuroimaging features and signs of MS may also be evaluated in the long term in recovered COVID-19 patients.
32427166,One of the many questions with respect to controlling the novel coronavirus pandemic is whether existing drugs can be re-purposed (re-positioned) for the prevention or treatment of Covid-19 - or for any future epidemic.
32427166,The usefulness of existing approaches for re-purposing range from computational modeling to clinical trials.
32427166,These are often time-consuming, resource intensive, and prone to failure.
32427166,Proposed here is a new but simple concept that would capitalize on the opportunity presented by the on-going natural experiment involving the collection of data from epidemiological surveillance screening and diagnostic testing for clinical treatment.
32427166,The objective would be to also collect for each Covid-19 case the patient's prior usage of existing therapeutic drugs.
32427166,These drug usage data would be collected for several major test groups - those who test positive for active SARS-CoV-2 infection (using molecular methods) and those who test negative for current infection but also test positive for past infection (using serologic antibody tests).
32427166,Patients from each of these groups would also be categorized with respect to where they resided on the spectrum of morbidities (from no or mild symptomology to severe).
32427166,By comparing the distribution of normalized usage data for each drug within each group, drugs that are more associated with particular test groups could be revealed as having potential prophylactic, therapeutic, or contraindicated effects with respect to disease progression.
32427166,These drugs could then be selected as candidates for further evaluation in fighting Covid-19.
32427166,Also summarized are some of the numerous attributes, advantages, and limitations of the proposed concept, all pointing to the need for further discussion and evaluation.
32427171,The COVID-19 pandemic is creating unique strains on the healthcare system.
32427171,While only a small percentage of patients require mechanical ventilation and ICU care, the enormous size of the populations affected means that these critical resources may become limited.
32427171,A number of non-invasive options exist to avert mechanical ventilation and ICU admission.
32427171,This is a clinical review of these options and their applicability in adult COVID-19 patients.
32427171,Summary recommendations include: (1) Avoid nebulized therapies.
32427171,Consider metered dose inhaler alternatives.
32427171,(2) Provide supplemental oxygen following usual treatment principles for hypoxic respiratory failure.
32427171,Maintain awareness of the aerosol-generating potential of all devices, including nasal cannulas, simple face masks, and venturi masks.
32427171,Use non-rebreather masks when possible.
32427171,Be attentive to aerosol generation and the use of personal protective equipment.
32427171,(3) High flow nasal oxygen is preferred for patients with higher oxygen support requirements.
32427171,Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation may be associated with higher risk of nosocomial transmission.
32427171,If used, measures special precautions should be used reduce aerosol formation.
32427171,(4) Early intubation/mechanical ventilation may be prudent for patients deemed likely to progress to critical illness, multi-organ failure, or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
32427173,A novel coronavirus (COVID-19) causing acute illness with severe symptoms has been isolated in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
32427173,Since its emergence, cases have been found worldwide, reminiscent of severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreaks over the past 2 decades.
32427173,Current understanding of this epidemic remains limited due to its rapid development and available data.
32427173,While occurrence outside mainland China remains low, the likelihood of increasing cases globally continues to rise.
32427173,Given this potential, it is imperative that emergency clinicians understand the preliminary data behind the dynamics of this disease, recognize possible presentations of patients, and understand proposed treatment modalities.
32427184,On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization announced the rapidly spreading epidemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
32427184,Almost all countries started to take proactive precautionary measures to reduce the risk of contracting the virus.
32427184,The education sector, including pharmacy education, has been drastically impacted by this pandemic.
32427184,During the outbreak, many hospitals instructed the health profession's schools to restrict or prevent the presence of their students and interns in their hospitals in an effort to limit the spread of the virus.
32427184,Constraining the presence of interns in the affiliated hospital has impacted the integrity of delivering the learning outcomes of each clinical rotation.
32427184,In this paper, we present the experience of four faculty preceptors in restructuring the advanced pharmacy practice experience in different clinical settings, including critical care, infectious diseases, cardiology, and internal medicine, in order to reduce the risk of contracting COVID-19 at a large academic medical institution in Saudi Arabia.
32427184,We believe that this experience could provide guidance and insights for other pharmacy schools dealing with this issue during this global pandemic.
32427192,The COVID-19 pandemic is currently a challenge worldwide.
32427192,In Austria, a crisis within the health care system has so far been avoided.
32427192,The treatment of patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), including SARS-CoV‑2 infections, should continue to be based on evidence-based CAP guidelines during the pandemic.
32427192,However, COVID-19-specific adjustments are useful.
32427192,The treatment of patients with chronic lung diseases must be adapted during the pandemic, but must still be guaranteed.
32427206,Complex systems have characteristics that give rise to the emergence of rare and extreme events.
32427206,This paper addresses an example of such type of crisis, namely the spread of the new Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32427206,The study deals with the statistical comparison and visualization of country-based real-data for the period December 31, 2019, up to April 12, 2020, and does not intend to address the medical treatment of the disease.
32427206,Two distinct approaches are considered, the description of the number of infected people across time by means of heuristic models fitting the real-world data, and the comparison of countries based on hierarchical clustering and multidimensional scaling.
32427206,The computational and mathematical modeling lead to the emergence of patterns, highlighting similarities and differences between the countries, pointing toward the main characteristics of the complex dynamics.
32427279,There is no proven antiviral or immunomodulatory therapy for COVID-19.
32427279,The disease progression associated with the pro-inflammatory host response prompted us to examine the role of early corticosteroid therapy in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19.
32427279,We conducted a single pre-test, single post-test quasi-experiment in a multi-center health system in Michigan from March 12 to March 27, 2020.
32427279,Adult patients with confirmed moderate to severe COVID were included.
32427279,A protocol was implemented on March 20, 2020 using early, short-course, methylprednisolone 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day divided in 2 intravenous doses for 3 days.
32427279,Outcomes of standard of care (SOC) and early corticosteroid groups were evaluated, with a primary composite endpoint of escalation of care from ward to ICU, new requirement for mechanical ventilation, and mortality.
32427279,All patients had at least 14 days of follow-up.
32427279,We analyzed 213 eligible subjects, 81 (38%) and 132 (62%) in SOC and early corticosteroid groups, respectively.The composite endpoint occurred at a significantly lower rate in the early corticosteroid group (34.9% vs.
32427279,54.3%, p=0.005).
32427279,This treatment effect was observed within each individual component of the composite endpoint.
32427279,Significant reduction in median hospital length of stay was also observed in the early corticosteroid group (8 vs. 5 days, p &lt; 0.001).
32427279,Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated an independent reduction in the composite endpoint at 14-days controlling for other factors (aOR: 0.41; 95% CI [0.22 - 0.77]).
32427279,An early short course of methylprednisolone in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 reduced escalation of care and improved clinical outcomes.
32427361,Originating from Wuhan, China, the novel coronavirus 2019 (SARS-CoV-2) has been spreading worldwide since the end of 2019.
32427361,The most common features of these patients include fever, cough, myalgia or fatigue [1].
32427361,As of April 16, 2020 the CDC has reported 605,390 cases and 24,582 deaths in the United States.
32427361,The illness continues to spread through the world infecting people with various different comorbid conditions.
32427361,Presented here are four cases which represent some of the first cases of HIV and SARS-CoV-2 coinfection in Long Island, New York.
32427361,These HIV infected patients were compliant with their HIV medication regimen and had robust CD4 T cell counts.
32427361,The clinical severity ranged from mild to requiring hospitalization.
32427361,Three of the four patients had fever and two had cough.
32427361,One patient presented with diarrhea, the incidence rate of diarrhea in SARS-CoV-2 infection range from 2% to 50% of cases [4].
32427361,One patient had anosmia and aguesia, in a study by Moein et al, the 98% of SARS-CoV-2 infected patient experienced some smell dysfunction [5].
32427361,One patient required hospitalization however this patient was also infected with influenza A.
32427361,These cases suggest that uncomplicated cases of SARS-CoV-2 in an HIV infected patient can be managed with self-isolation at home.

32427393,The medical, public health, and scientific communities are grappling with monumental imperatives to contain COVID-19, develop effective vaccines, identify efficacious treatments for the infection and its complications, and find biomarkers that detect patients at risk of severe disease.
32427393,The focus of this communication is on a potential biomarker, short telomere length (TL), that might serve to identify patients more likely to die from the SARS-CoV-2 infection, regardless of age.
32427393,The common thread linking these patients is lymphopenia, which largely reflects a decline in the numbers of CD4/CD8 T cells but not B cells.
32427393,These findings are consistent with data that lymphocyte TL dynamics impose a limit on T-cell proliferation.
32427393,They suggest that T-cell lymphopoiesis might stall in individuals with short TL who are infected with SARS-CoV-2.
32427613,Severe acute respiratory distress syndrome is complicated with coronavirus disease 2019 and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support may be necessary in severe cases.
32427613,This study is to summarize the clinical features, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation characteristics, and outcomes of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pneumonia received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.
32427613,Descriptive study from two hospitals.
32427613,The ICUs from university hospitals.
32427613,Patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pneumonia received mechanical ventilation, including those underwent extracorporeal membrane oxygenation from Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital from January 8, 2020, to March 31, 2020.
32427613,None.
32427613,Clinical records, laboratory results, ventilator parameters, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation-related data were abstracted from the medical records.
32427613,One-hundred twenty-nine critically ill patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pneumonia were admitted to ICU of the two referral hospitals.
32427613,Fifty-nine patients received mechanical ventilation and 21 of them received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support (fourteen from Zhongnan hospital and seven from Wuhan pulmonary hospital).
32427613,Compared to mechanical ventilation patients without extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support, there was a tendency of decline in mortality but with no significant difference (no-extracorporeal membrane oxygenation group 24/38 [63.2%] vs extracorporeal membrane oxygenation group 12/21 [57.1%]; p = 0.782).
32427613,For those patients with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, 12 patients died and nine survived by April 7, 2020.
32427613,Among extracorporeal membrane oxygenation patients, the PaCO2 prior to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was lower (54.40 mm Hg [29.20-57.50 mm Hg] vs 63.20 mm Hg [55.40-72.12 mm Hg]; p = 0.006), and pH prior to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was higher (7.38 [7.28-7.48] vs 7.23 [7.16-7.33]; p = 0.023) in survivors than nonsurvivors.
32427613,Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation might be an effective salvage treatment for patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pneumonia associated with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome.
32427613,Severe CO2 retention and acidosis prior to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation indicated a poor prognosis.
32427632,The novel coronavirus-2019 disease (COVID-19) pandemic has had devastating consequences on healthcare systems globally.
32427632,The effect this has on urologists and the patients they care for is not fully understood and presents the challenge of prioritizing the most urgent cases.
32427632,We aim to review the impact on urology services and evaluate strategies to minimize disruption.
32427632,Various healthcare systems have been forced to postpone treatment for many urological conditions as resources are dedicated to the treatment of COVID-19.
32427632,Training has been postponed as staff are reallocated to areas of need.
32427632,Face-to-face contact is largely minimized and innovative, virtual communication methods are used in the outpatient setting and multidisciplinary team meetings.
32427632,Surgical practice is changing because of the risks posed by COVID-19 and procedures can be prioritized in a nonurgent, low priority, high priority or emergency category.
32427632,Although the COVID-19 pandemic will inevitably affect urological services, steps can be taken to mitigate the impact and prioritize the patients most in need of urgent care.
32427632,Similarly, in future; simulation, e-learning and webinars will allow interaction to share, discuss and debate focused training and education.
32427773,The COVID-19 pandemic has led to unprecedented stresses on modern medical systems, overwhelming the resource infrastructure in numerous countries while presenting a unique series of pathophysiologic clinical findings.
32427773,Thrombotic coagulopathy is common in critically ill patients suffering from COVID-19, with associated high rates of respiratory failure requiring prolonged periods of mechanical ventilation.
32427773,Here we report a case series of five patients suffering from profound, medically refractory COVID-19 associated respiratory failure who were treated with fibrinolytic therapy using tissue plasminogen activator (tPA, Alteplase).
32427773,All five patients appeared to have an improved respiratory status following tPA administration: one patient had an initial marked improvement that partially regressed after several hours, one patient had transient improvements that were not sustained, and three patients had sustained clinical improvements following tPA administration.
32427774,Coronavirus patients demonstrate varying degrees of respiratory insufficiency; many will progress to respiratory failure with a severe version of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) refractory to traditional supportive strategies.
32427774,Providers must consider alternative therapies to deter or prevent the cascade of decompensation to fulminant respiratory failure.
32427774,This is a case-series of five COVID-19 positive patients who demonstrated severe hypoxemia, declining respiratory performance, and escalating oxygen requirements.
32427774,Patients met the following criteria: COVID-19 positivity, worsening respiratory performance, severe hypoxemia (PaO2&lt;80) despite traditional supportive measures, escalating supplemental oxygen requirements and D-dimer greater than 1.5μg/mL.
32427774,All patients received protocol directed thrombolytic therapy with Tissue Plasminogen Activator (tPA).
32427774,All five patients improved without deleterious effects of thrombolytic therapy.
32427774,Patient one was on maximum ventilator support, paralytics, and prone positioning without improvement.
32427774,During tPA administration his P/F ratio improved from 69 to 127.
32427774,Ventilator support was weaned immediately on post-treatment day 1 and he was extubated on post treatment day 12.
32427774,Our second through fifth patients were not intubated at time of initiation of tPA therapy.
32427774,These patients each required significant oxygen supplementation trending toward intubation.
32427774,After tPA therapy, all patients demonstrated a noticeable increase in PaO2 values overtime.
32427774,Three of these patients avoided intubation due to COVID-19 associated respiratory failure.
32427774,Administration of thrombolytics was followed by overall improvement in patients' oxygen requirements, and in three cases, prevented progression to mechanical ventilation, without deleterious effects.
32427774,Clinical trials of thrombolytic therapy would further serve to underscore the efficacy and utility of this therapy.
32427774,Level V- Case series of therapeutic effect.
32428072,In response to the accelerated increase in the number of COVID-19 cases, countries must increase their supply of beds in intensive care units (ICUs).
32428072,Respiratory diseases, neoplasms, cardiopathies and hypertension, and diabetes are associated with higher COVID-19 case-fatality.
32428072,The study aimed to identify the regions of Brazil with higher specific mortality rates from these comorbidities and the regions with the greatest shortage of ICU beds and mechanical ventilators.
32428072,A cross-sectional ecological study was performed in which the units of analysis were the country's Health Regions.
32428072,Data were obtained from Brazilian Health Informatics Department - DATASUS (National Registry of Healthcare Establishments - 2019, Mortality Information Systems - 2017, and Population Projections - 2017).
32428072,We calculated the disease group-specific mortality rates for hypertension, neoplasms, diabetes, cardiac diseases, respiratory diseases and the rates of total ICU beds, private ICU beds, ICU beds in the Brazilian Unified National Health System (SUS), and ventilators in the SUS, per 100,000 inhabitants.
32428072,The mortality profile was determined by latent profiles analysis, and the cluster analysis of ICU beds and ventilators used the spatial scan method.
32428072,Kernel maps were constructed for the data's visualization.
32428072,Level of significance was set at 5%.
32428072,Four latent mortality profiles were observed.
32428072,The Health Regions with the highest mean mortality rates were located in regions with shortages of ICU beds and ventilators, especially in parts of the Northeast, Southeast, and South of Brazil.
32428072,The spatial localization of regions with both the highest mortality and shortages of ICU beds/ventilators requires attention by policymakers and public planners to deal efficiently and fairly with the COVID-19 epidemic in Brazil.
32428144,A covid-19 pandemic decreed by WHO has raised greater awareness of it.
32428144,The infection reached the mark of 350,000 patients in 33 countries and affected as comorbidities the presence of comorbidities and advanced age.
32428144,The transmissibility calculated so far is similar to the H1N1 epidemic, but with lower mortality rates.
32428144,The SARS-CoV-2 virus, of the Coronaviridae family, has the capacity for cellular invasion through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 does not have a lower respiratory epithelium and in the cells of the small intestine mucosa.
32428144,A presentation can be divided into mild (fever, fatigue, cough, myalgia, and sputum) and severe (cyanosis, dyspnoea, tachypnea, chest pain, hypoxemia and need for clinical measurement) and has an estimated estimate of 2%.allows the detection of viral load in CRP-TR of patients with high clinical suspicion.
32428144,Based on supportive measures and infection control.
32428144,In severe cases, the use of medications such as hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin or medication can be promising.
32428144,Take care to avoid the use of corticosteroids.
32428144,There are no restrictions on the use of resources and ACEIs / ARBs.
32428242,The pandemic has affected every aspect of myeloma care.
32428242,Immediate focus is minimizing risk of contracting COVID-19 and the sequelae of infection.
32428242,However, what does the future hold for our patients?
32428242,What lessons will be taken forward to tackle myeloma in the fiscally constrained future?
32428242,If we embrace the challenges that will emerge in the post-pandemic environment, the treatment delivered to patients could be more cost effective and better tailored than before.
32428242,Healthcare delivery post-COVID will not return to how it was, and now is the time to invest in novel strategies to deliver the best possible outcomes for patients.
32428245,The UK National Health Service (NHS) has risen to the challenge posed by COVID-19 through Herculean efforts to expand capacity.
32428245,This has included doubling or trebling intensive care (ICU) capacity within hospitals, augmenting this with Nightingale Hospitals, cancelling all non-emergency surgery and redeploying staff and equipment to focus on a single disease.
32428245,At the same time, government and population efforts have - through social distancing then lockdown- successfully flattened the epidemic curve and so reduced demand.
32428245,Together, these actions have enabled treatment of all those needing hospital care for COVID-19 and avoided the unfettered increase in mortality that would have accompanied an overwhelmed healthcare service.
32428290,In December 2019, an outbreak of a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) began in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
32428290,This virus strain causes the respiratory illness coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32428290,Despite significant research efforts in this field, there is limited data on COVID-19 in pregnancy.
32428290,This article presents a case of a pregnant woman from Wuhan infected with SARS-CoV-2, including her symptoms, pregnancy outcome, and treatment strategy.
32428372,On March 11<sup>th</sup> 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) as a pandemic.
32428372,Until an effective treatment or a vaccine is developed, the current recommendations are to contain the disease, and control its transmission.
32428372,It is now clear that the primary mode of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is aerosol/droplet spread, and by contacting virus contaminated surfaces acting as fomites (inanimate vectors).
32428372,Furthermore, recent data indicate that the live virus particles are present in saliva, and, more alarmingly, asymptomatic individuals may transmit the infection.
32428372,By virtue of the nature of the practice of dentistry where intrinsically, a high volume of aerosols are produced, as well as the close proximity of dentists and patients during treatment, dentists and allied health staff are considered the highest risk health professional group for acquiring SARS-CoV-2 during patient management.
32428372,Therefore, several organizations and specialty associations have proposed guidelines and recommendations for limiting the transmission of SARS-COV-2 from carriers to dentists and vice versa.
32428372,This paper aims to provide a review of these guidelines, and concludes with a brief look at how the practice of dentistry may be impacted by COVID-19, in the post-pandemic era.
32428379,The quest for the effective treatment against COVID-19 pneumonia caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is hampered by the lack of knowledge concerning the basic cell biology of the infection.
32428379,Given that most viruses use endocytosis to enter the host cell, mechanistic investigation of SARS-CoV-2 infection needs to consider the diversity of endocytic pathways available for SARS-CoV-2 entry in the human lung epithelium.
32428379,Taking advantage of the well-established methodology of membrane trafficking studies, this research direction allows for rapid characterisation of the key cell biological mechanism(s) responsible for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32428379,Furthermore, 11 clinically approved generic drugs are identified as potential candidates for repurposing as blockers of several potential routes for SARS-CoV-2 endocytosis.
32428379,More broadly, the paradigm of targeting a fundamental aspect of human cell biology to protect against infection may be advantageous in the context of future pandemic outbreaks.
32428835,The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has once again aroused people's concern about coronavirus.
32428835,Seven human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been discovered so far, including HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU115, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.
32428835,Existing studies show that the cardiovascular disease increased the incidence and severity of coronavirus infection.
32428835,At the same time, myocardial injury caused by coronavirus infection is one of the main factors contributing to poor prognosis.
32428835,In this review, the recent clinical findings about the relationship between coronaviruses and cardiovascular diseases and the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are discussed.
32428835,This review aimed to provide assistance for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.
32428864,The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global health emergency that poses a significant threat to world people's health.
32428864,This outbreak causes major challenges to healthcare systems.
32428864,Given the lack of effective treatments or vaccine for it, the identification of novel and safe drugs against COVID-19 infection is an urgent need.
32428864,Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is not only an entry receptor of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the virus that causes COVID-19, but also can protect from lung injury.
32428864,In this view, we highlighted potential approaches to address ACE2-mediated SARS-CoV-2 virus, including 1) delivering an excessive soluble form of ACE2 (recombinant human ACE2: rhACE2) and 2) inhibition of the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 virus and ACE2 by some compounds with competitive effects (morphine and codeine).
32428864,Further clinical trials in this regard can reveal a more definite conclusion against the COVID-19 disaster.
32428865,Remdesivir is a broad spectrum anti-viral drug that has shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2, in vitro and in vivo.
32428865,In absence of any effective treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19), remdesivir has been tried for a compassionate use in severe COVID-19.
32428865,Newer randomized controlled studies that have recently become available, showed a mixed result.
32428865,We aimed to systematically search the literature to understand the pharmacology and clinical effects of remdesivir in patients with COVID-19.
32428865,We systematically searched the PubMed, ClinicalTrial.Org and MedRxiv database up till May 5, 2020 using specific key words such as &quot;Remdesivir&quot; or 'GS-5734″ AND &quot;COVID-19&quot; or &quot;SARS-CoV-2&quot; and retrieved all the article published in English language, that have reported the pharmacology and the clinical outcomes of remdesivir in patients with COVID-19.
32428865,Initial compassionate use of remdesivir has shown a fairly good result, but difficult to quantify, in the absence of control arm.
32428865,While the very first double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial conducted in Wuhan, did not find any significant benefit compared to the control, the preliminary result of another similar multi-country trial has shown a significant faster time to recovery but without any difference in mortality.
32428865,Remdesivir has shown a mixed result in patients with COVID-19 with an acceptable side effect.
32428865,However, jury is still out while awaiting the results from the forthcoming trials.
32428909,Due to the exponential growth of the number of subjects affected by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the entire Italian health care system had to respond promptly and in a very short time with the need of semi-intensive and intensive care units.
32428909,Moreover, trained dedicated COVID-19 teams consisting of physicians were coming from different specialties (intensivists or pneumologists and infectiologists), while respiratory therapists and nurses have been recruited to work on and on without rest.
32428909,However, due to still limited and evolving knowledge of COVID-19, there are few recommendations concerning the need in respiratory rehabilitation and physiotherapy interventions.
32428909,The presentation of this paper is the result of a consensus promoted by the Italian societies of respiratory health care professionals who contacted pulmonologists directly involved in the treatment and rehabilitation of COVID-19.
32428909,The aim was to formulate the more proper and common suggestions to be applied in different hospital settings in offering rehabilitative programs and physiotherapy workforce planning for COVID-19 patients.
32428909,Two main areas of intervention were identified: organization and treatment, which are described in this paper to face the emergency.
32428957,Up to February 24<sup>th</sup> 2020 occasionally occuring SARS-CoV-2 infections in Germany without severe course.
32428957,Emergency presentation of a couple in the emergency room.
32428957,For seven days now, the man has fever, dry cough und physical weakness and the wife has similar symptoms of a milder form.
32428957,The clinical examination shows fine crackles over both lungs and a respiratory failure of the husband.
32428957,Laboratory increase in inflammation parameters as well as transaminases and lactate dehydrogenase.
32428957,Radiologically lung infiltrates of different severity.
32428957,Further on diagnosis of a SARS-CoV-2-infection of both patients with a severe course of the male.
32428957,Intubation and mechanical ventilation of the male patient with prolonged intenive care treatment.
32428957,Recovery of the female patient under conventional oxygen therapy.
32428957,These two cases show the starting point of an endemic spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the district of Heinsberg (North Rhine-Westphalia) and up to this point the first case of a life-threatenning course in Germany.
32428957,Bis zum 24.02.2020 vereinzelt auftretende, nicht schwerverlaufende SARS-CoV-2-Infektionen in Deutschland.
32428957,Notfallmäßige Vorstellung eines Ehepaars in der zentralen Notaufnahme.
32428957,Der Mann gibt an, seit 7 Tagen an hochfieberhaften Temperaturen, trockenem Reizhusten und körperlicher Schwäche zu leiden, während die Ehefrau ähnliche Symptome in milderer Ausprägung bietet.
32428957,In der klinischen Untersuchung fallen feinblasige Rasselgeräusche über beiden Lungen beider Patienten und eine respiratorische Insuffizienz des Ehemanns auf.
32428957,Laborserologisch Erhöhung der Inflammationsparameter sowie der Transaminasen und der Laktatdehydrogenase.
32428957,Röntgenologisch pulmonale Infiltrate unterschiedlicher Ausprägung bei beiden Patienten.
32428957,Im weiteren Verlauf Nachweis einer SARS-CoV-2-Infektion der Ehepartner mit schwerem Verlauf beim männlichen Patienten.
32428957,Intubation und Beatmung des männlichen Patienten bei mittelschwerem ARDS mit langer intensivmedizinischer Behandlung.
32428957,Genesung der weiblichen Patientin unter Sauerstofftherapie.
32428957,Diese beiden Fälle zeigen den Ausgangspunkt einer endemischen Verbreitung von SARS-CoV-2 im Landkreis Heinsberg (NRW) und bis zu diesem Zeitpunkt den ersten Fall eines lebensbedrohlichen Verlaufs in Deutschland.
32429099,Following the outbreak of novel severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus (CoV)2, the majority of nations are struggling with countermeasures to fight infection, prevent spread and improve patient survival.
32429099,Considering that the pandemic is a recent event, no large clinical trials have been possible and since coronavirus specific drug are not yet available, there is no strong consensus on how to treat the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) associated viral pneumonia.
32429099,Coronaviruses code for an important multifunctional enzyme named papain-like protease (PLP), that has many roles in pathogenesis.
32429099,First, PLP is one of the two viral cysteine proteases, along with 3-chymotripsin-like protease, that is responsible for the production of the replicase proteins required for viral replication.
32429099,Second, its intrinsic deubiquitinating and deISGylating activities serve to antagonize the host's immune response that would otherwise hinder infection.
32429099,Both deubiquitinating and deISGylating functions involve the removal of the small regulatory polypeptides, ubiquitin and ISG15, respectively, from target proteins.
32429099,Ubiquitin modifications can regulate the innate immune response by affecting regulatory proteins, either by altering their stability via the ubiquitin proteasome pathway or by directly regulating their activity.
32429099,ISG15 is a ubiquitin-like modifier with pleiotropic effects, typically expressed during the host cell immune response.
32429099,PLP inhibitors have been evaluated during past coronavirus epidemics, and have showed promising results as an antiviral therapy in vitro.
32429099,In this review, we recapitulate the roles of PLPs in coronavirus infections, report a list of PLP inhibitors and suggest possible therapeutic strategies for COVID-19 treatment, using both clinical and preclinical drugs.
32429249,When preparing for the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and the coronavirus infection disease (COVID-19) questions arose regarding various aspects concerning the anaesthetist.
32429249,When reviewing the literature it became obvious that keeping up-to-date with all relevant publications is almost impossible.
32429249,We searched for and summarised clinically relevant topics that could help making clinical decisions.
32429249,This is a subjective analysis of literature concerning specific topics raised in our daily practice (e.g., clinical features of COVID-19 patients; ventilation of the critically ill COVID-19 patient; diagnostic of infection with SARS-CoV-2; stability of the virus; Covid-19 in specific patient populations, e.g., paediatrics, immunosuppressed patients, patients with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, kidney or liver disease; co-medication with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); antiviral treatment) and we believe that these answers help colleagues in clinical decision-making.
32429249,With ongoing treatment of severely ill COVID-19 patients other questions will come up.
32429249,While respective guidelines on these topics will serve clinicians in clinical practice, regularly updating all guidelines concerning COVID-19 will be a necessary, although challenging task in the upcoming weeks and months.
32429249,All recommendations during the current extremely rapid development of knowledge must be evaluated on a daily basis, as suggestions made today may be out-dated with the new evidence available tomorrow.
32429572,The current Coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19 pandemic has infected over two million people and resulted in the death of over one hundred thousand people at the time of writing this review.
32429572,The disease is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32429572,Even though multiple vaccines and treatments are under development so far, the disease is only slowing down under extreme social distancing measures that are difficult to maintain.
32429572,SARS-COV-2 is an enveloped virus that is surrounded by a lipid bilayer.
32429572,Lipids are fundamental cell components that play various biological roles ranging from being a structural building block to a signaling molecule as well as a central energy store.
32429572,The role lipids play in viral infection involves the fusion of the viral membrane to the host cell, viral replication, and viral endocytosis and exocytosis.
32429572,Since lipids play a crucial function in the viral life cycle, we asked whether drugs targeting lipid metabolism, such as statins, can be utilized against SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses.
32429572,In this review, we discuss the role of lipid metabolism in viral infection as well as the possibility of targeting lipid metabolism to interfere with the viral life cycle.
32429580,Remdesivir is a nucleotide prodrug that is currently undergoing extensive clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19.
32429580,The prodrug is metabolized to its active triphosphate form and interferes with the action of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of SARS-COV-2.
32429580,Herein, we report the antiviral activity of remdesivir against human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) compared to known anti-HIV agents.
32429580,These agents included tenofovir (TFV), 4'-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2'-deoxyadenosine (EFdA), alovudine (FLT), lamivudine (3TC), and emtricitabine (FTC), known as nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), and a number of 5'-<i>O</i>-fatty acylated anti-HIV nucleoside conjugates.
32429580,The anti-HIV nucleosides interfere with HIV RNA-dependent DNA polymerase and/or act as chain terminators.
32429580,Normal human fibroblast lung cells (MRC-5) were used to determine the cytotoxicity of the compounds.
32429580,The study revealed that remdesivir exhibited an EC<sub>50</sub> value of 0.07 µM against HCoV-229E with TC<sub>50</sub> of &gt; 2.00 µM against MRC-5 cells.
32429580,Parent NRTIs were found to be inactive against (HCoV-229E) at tested concentrations.
32429580,Among all the NRTIs and 5'-<i>O</i>-fatty acyl conjugates of NRTIs, 5'-<i>O</i>-tetradecanoyl ester conjugate of FTC showed modest activity with EC<sub>50</sub> and TC<sub>50</sub> values of 72.8 µM and 87.5 µM, respectively.
32429580,These data can be used for the design of potential compounds against other coronaviruses.
32429703,<b>Introduction</b>: Coronavirus has been responsible for several virus outbreaks since 2003, caused by SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and currently SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), the causative agent of coronavirus disease in 2019.
32429703,COVID-19 has become a global public health emergency because of its high virulence and mortality capacity.
32429703,This patent review aims to provide an overview of the patents that present possible treatments for SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV.<b>Areas covered</b>: To treat SARS, MERS and SARS-CoV-2, researchers have filed patents for a number of therapeutic agents.
32429703,Most of the treatments found were protease inhibitors aimed at proteases such as PLpro, 3CLpro, RNA helicase, and Spike protein, or used monoclonal antibodies and interferons.
32429703,In addition, the use of Chinese folk medicine and its multitude of medicinal plants with strong antiviral properties was reinforced.
32429703,Thus, these therapies used in previous epidemics can serve as an aid in the new pandemic by SARS-CoV-2 and be a starting point for new treatments.<b>Expert opinion</b>: The various antiviral alternatives presented in this review offer therapeutic options to fight coronavirus infections.
32429703,If shown to be effective, these drugs may be extremely important in the current pandemic.
32429774,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has challenged health care systems and physicians worldwide to attempt to provide the best care to their patients with an evolving understanding of this unique pathogen.
32429774,This disease and its worldwide impact have sparked tremendous interest in the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical consequences of COVID-19.
32429774,This accumulating body of evidence has centered around case series and often empiric therapies as controlled trials are just getting underway.
32429774,What is clear is that patients appear to be at higher risk for thrombotic disease states including acute coronary syndrome (ACS), venous thromboembolism (VTE) such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), or stroke.
32429774,Patients with underlying cardiovascular disease are also at higher risk for morbidity and mortality if infected.
32429774,These patients are commonly treated with anticoagulation and/or antiplatelet medications and less commonly thrombolysis during hospitalization, potentially with great benefit but management of these medications can be difficult in potentially critically ill patients.In this paper, we review the current guidelines, consensus statements, and emerging evidence for a wide range of cardiovascular disease states with special focus on anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy.
32429774,Our goal is to provide guidance for treatment of the cardiovascular patient with COVID-19 in the face of a rapidly evolving understanding of this virus and its complications.Preamble:Anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapies are a major cause of inpatient morbidity and mortality.
32429774,This is amplified in critically ill patients.
32429774,COVID-19 patients present special challenges due to rapidly changing clinical status.
32429774,In an effort to align practice patterns across a large health system (Jefferson Health 2,622 staffed inpatient beds and 319 intensive care unit (ICU) beds across 14 facilities), a task force was assembled to address the utilization of anti-thrombotic and anti-platelet therapy in COVID-19 positive or suspected patients.
32429774,The task force incorporated experts in Cardiology, Vascular Medicine, Hematology, Vascular Surgery, Pharmacy, and Vascular Neurology.
32429774,Current guidelines, consensus documents, and policy documents from specialty organizations were used to formulate health system recommendations.
32429774,Our deliberations and treatment recommendations are summarized here.Objective:To provide guidance to the utilization of antithrombotic and antiplatelet therapies in patients with known or suspected COVID-19.
32430286,The anti-malarial drugs chloroquine (CQ) and primarily the less toxic hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) are currently used to treat autoimmune diseases for their immunomodulatory and anti-thrombotic properties.
32430286,They have also been proposed for the treatment of several viral infections, due to their anti-viral effects in cell cultures and animal models, and, currently, for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the pandemic severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by coronavirus 2 (Sars-Cov-2) infection that is spreading all over the world.
32430286,Although in some recent studies a clinical improvement in COVID-19 patients has been observed, the clinical efficacy of CQ and HCQ in COVID-19 has yet to be proven with randomized controlled studies, many of which are currently ongoing, also considering pharmacokinetics, optimal dosing regimen, therapeutic level and duration of treatment and taking into account patients with different severity degrees of disease.
32430286,Here we review what is currently known on the mechanisms of action of CQ and HCQ as anti-viral, anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic drugs and discuss the up-to-date experimental evidence on the potential mechanisms of action of CQ/HCQ in Sars-Cov2 infection and the current clinical knowledge on their efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19 patients.
32430286,Given the role of iron in several human viral infections, we also propose a different insight into a number of CQ and HCQ pharmacological effects, suggesting a potential involvement of iron homeostasis in Sars-Cov-2 infection and COVID-19 clinical course.
32430428,The duration of viral shedding is central to guide the decisions of isolation precautions and antiviral treatment.
32430428,However, studies regarding the risk factors associated with prolonged SARS-CoV-2 shedding and the impact of Lopinavir/Ritonavir (LPV/r) treatment on viral shedding remain scarce.
32430428,Data were collected from all SARS-CoV-2 infected patients who were admitted to isolation wards and had reverse transcription polymerase chain-reaction conversion at the No.3 People's Hospital of Hubei province between 31 January and 09 March 2020.
32430428,We compared clinical characteristics and SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding between patients initiated with LPV/r treatment and those without.
32430428,Logistic regression analysis was employed to evaluate the risk factors associated with prolonged viral shedding.
32430428,Of 120 patients, the median age was 52 years, 54 (45%) were male and 78 (65%) received LPV/r treatment.
32430428,The median duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection from symptom onset was 23 days (IQR, 18-32 days).
32430428,Older age (odd ratio [OR] 1.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00-1.05, p=0.03) and the lack of LPV/r treatment (OR 2.42, 95% CI 1.10-5.36, p=0.029) were independent risk factors of prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding.
32430428,Patients who initiated LPV/r treatment within 10 days from symptom onset, but not initiated from day 11 onwards, had significantly shorter viral shedding duration compared with those without LPV/r treatment (median 19 days <i>versus</i> 28.5 days, Log-rank p&lt;0.001).
32430428,Older age and the lack of LPV/r treatment were independently associated with prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding in patients with COVID-19.
32430428,Earlier administration of LPV/r treatment could shorten viral shedding duration.
32430429,Timely diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is a prerequisite for treatment and prevention.
32430429,The serology characteristics and complement diagnosis value of the antibody test to RNA test need to be demonstrated.
32430429,Serial sera of 80 patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 were collected at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, China.
32430429,Total antibody (Ab), IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected, and the antibody dynamics during the infection were described.
32430429,The seroconversion rates for Ab, IgM and IgG were 98.8%, 93.8% and 93.8%, respectively.
32430429,The first detectible serology marker was Ab, followed by IgM and IgG, with a median seroconversion time of 15, 18 and 20 days post exposure (d.p.e) or 9, 10 and 12 days post onset (d.p.o), respectively.
32430429,The antibody levels increased rapidly beginning at 6 d.p.o. and were accompanied by a decline in viral load.
32430429,For patients in the early stage of illness (0-7 d.p.o), Ab showed the highest sensitivity (64.1%) compared to IgM and IgG (33.3% for both, p&lt;0.001).
32430429,The sensitivities of Ab, IgM and IgG increased to 100%, 96.7% and 93.3% 2 weeks later, respectively.
32430429,When the same antibody type was detected, no significant difference was observed between enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and other forms of immunoassays.
32430429,A typical acute antibody response is induced during SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32430429,Serology testing provides an important complement to RNA testing in the later stages of illness for pathogenic specific diagnosis and helpful information to evaluate the adapted immunity status of patients.
32430456,An important prognostic factor in any form of infection seems to be glucose control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
32430456,There is no information about the effects of tight glycemic control on Covid-19 outcomes in patients with hyperglycemia.
32430456,Therefore, we examined the effects of optimal glycemic control in patients with hyperglycemia affected by Covid-19.
32430456,Fifty-nine patients with Covid-19 hospitalized with moderate disease were evaluated.
32430456,On the basis of admission glycemia &gt;7.77 mmol/L, patients were divided into hyperglycemic and normoglycemic groups.
32430456,Interleukin 6 (IL-6) and D-dimer levels were evaluated at admission and weekly during hospitalization.
32430456,The composite end point was severe disease, admission to an intensive care unit, use of mechanical ventilation, or death.
32430456,Thirty-four (57.6%) patients were normoglycemic and 25 (42.4%) were hyperglycemic.
32430456,In the hyperglycemic group, 7 (28%) and 18 (72%) patients were diagnosed with diabetes already before admission, and 10 (40%) and 15 (60%) were treated without and with insulin infusion, respectively.
32430456,The mean of glycemia during hospitalization was 10.65 ± 0.84 mmol/L in the no insulin infusion group and 7.69 ± 1.85 mmol/L in the insulin infusion group.
32430456,At baseline, IL-6 and D-dimer levels were significantly higher in the hyperglycemic group than in the normoglycemic group (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001).
32430456,Despite that all patients were on standard treatment for Covid-19 infection, IL-6 and D-dimer levels persisted higher in patients with hyperglycemia during hospitalization.
32430456,In a risk-adjusted Cox regression analysis, both patients with hyperglycemia and patients with diabetes had a higher risk of severe disease than those without diabetes and with normoglycemia.
32430456,Cox regression analysis evidenced that patients with hyperglycemia treated with insulin infusion had a lower risk of severe disease than patients without insulin infusion.
32430456,Insulin infusion may be an effective method for achieving glycemic targets and improving outcomes in patients with Covid-19.
32430617,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) is the reason for this ongoing pandemic infection diseases termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that has emerged since early December 2019 in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.
32430617,In this century, it is the worst threat to international health and the economy.
32430617,After 4 months of COVID-19 outbreak, there is no certain and approved medicine against it.
32430617,In this public health emergency, it makes sense to investigate the possible effects of old drugs and find drug repositioning that is efficient, economical, and riskless process.
32430617,Old drugs that may be effective are from different pharmacological categories, antimalarials, anthelmintics, anti-protozoal, anti-HIVs, anti-influenza, anti-hepacivirus, antineoplastics, neutralizing antibodies, immunoglobulins, and interferons.
32430617,In vitro, in vivo, or preliminary trials of these drugs in the treatment of COVID-19 have been encouraging, leading to new research projects and trials to find the best drug/s.
32430617,In this review, we discuss the possible mechanisms of these drugs against COVID-19.
32430617,Also, it should be mentioned that in this manuscript, we discuss preliminary rationales; however, clinical trial evidence is needed to prove them.
32430617,COVID-19 therapy must be based on expert clinical experience and published literature and guidelines from major health organizations.
32430617,Moreover, herein, we describe current evidence that may be changed in the future.
32430651,SARS-CoV-2 is characterized by a spike protein allowing viral binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-2, which acts as a viral receptor and is expressed on the surface of several pulmonary and extra-pulmonary cell types, including cardiac, renal, intestinal and endothelial cells.
32430651,There is evidence that also endothelial cells are infected by SARS-COV-2, with subsequent occurrence of systemic vasculitis, thromboembolism and disseminated intravascular coagulation.
32430651,Those effects, together with the &quot;cytokine storm&quot; are involved in a worse prognosis.
32430651,In clinical practice, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are extensively used for the treatment of hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases.
32430651,In in vivo studies, ACE-Is and ARBs seem to paradoxically increase ACE-2 expression, which could favour SARS-CoV-2 infection of host's cells and tissues.
32430651,By contrast, in patients treated with ACE-Is and ARBs, ACE-2 shows a downregulation at the mRNA and protein levels in kidney and cardiac tissues.
32430651,Yet, it has been claimed that both ARBs and ACE-Is could result potentially useful in the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients.
32430651,As detected in China and as the Italian epidemiological situation confirms, the most prevalent comorbidities in deceased patients with COVID-19 are hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.
32430651,Older COVID-19-affected patients with cardiovascular comorbidities exhibit a more severe clinical course and a worse prognosis, with many of them being also treated with ARBs or ACE-Is.
32430651,Another confounding factor is cigarette smoking, which has been reported to increase ACE-2 expression in both experimental models and humans.
32430651,Sex also plays a role, with chromosome X harbouring the gene coding for ACE-2, which is one of the possible explanations of why mortality in female patients is lower.
32430651,Viral entry also depends on TMPRSS2 protease activity, an androgen dependent enzyme.
32430651,Despite the relevance of experimental animal studies, to comprehensively address the question of the potential hazards or benefits of ACE-Is and ARBs on the clinical course of COVID-19-affected patients treated by these anti-hypertensive drugs, we will need randomized human studies.
32430651,We claim the need of adequately powered, prospective studies aimed at answering the following questions of paramount importance for cardiovascular, internal and emergency medicine: Do ACE-Is and ARBs exert similar or different effects on infection or disease course?
32430651,Are such effects dangerous, neutral or even useful in older, COVID-19-affected patients?
32430651,Do they act on multiple cell types?
32430651,Since ACE-Is and ARBs have different molecular targets, the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection could be also different in patients treated by one or the other of these two drug classes.
32430651,At present, insufficient detailed data from trials have been made available.
32430996,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is an ongoing pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with considerable mortality worldwide.
32430996,The main clinical manifestation of COVID-19 is the presence of respiratory symptoms, but some patients develop severe cardiovascular and renal complications.
32430996,There is an urgency to understand the mechanism by which this virus causes complications so as to develop treatment options.
32430996,Curcumin, a natural polyphenolic compound, could be a potential treatment option for patients with coronavirus disease.
32430996,In this study, we review some of the potential effects of curcumin such as inhibiting the entry of virus to the cell, inhibiting encapsulation of the virus and viral protease as well as modulating various cellular signaling pathways.
32430996,This review provides a basis for further research and development of clinical applications of curcumin for the treatment of newly emerged SARS-CoV-2.

32431119,The spread of epidemics resulting in many deaths has been known since the dawn of civilization, for example, the typhus and smallpox epidemics and the plague.
32431119,Early in the previous century there was an outbreak of the Spanish Flue and towards the end of the 60's, the AIDS epidemic (HIV).
32431119,Since the start of the current century, several epidemics broke out and spread to various places around the world, for instance, SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), the Avian Influenza and the Swine Influenza.
32431119,In 2014 there was an outbreak of Ebola (Ebola virus disease) and in 2015 the Zika virus emerged and there were more.
32431119,Epidemics cause havoc and impact all areas of life.
32431119,Each epidemic takes an unfathomable price in lives.
32431119,It is estimated, for example, that the AIDS epidemic took the lives of some 30 million people.
32431119,The Corona virus (Covid-19) broke out in China, towards the end of 2019 and spread to most parts of the world.
32431119,The implications of the outbreak are similar in many countries, among others, due to the uncertainty regarding the way the virus spreads, the appropriate treatment, the lack of vaccination and the high rate of deaths.
32431119,Naturally, at such times physical protection is a top priority.
32431119,However, coping with the implications to people's mental health is no less important and these may result in long-term negative impacts.
32431134,Due to COVID-19 outbreak, to lighten the burden of acute and critical care hospitals, some respiratory rehabilitation departments have been used to host patients with COVID-19 in the post-acute phase.
32431134,This new and unexpected situation required a change of roles and scheduling of the rehabilitation teams.
32431134,In this manuscript we describe the unexpected and urgent organizational change of the Cardio-Pulmonary Rehabilitation (CPR) service during the COVID-19 emergency in a Northern Italian rehabilitation hospital, focusing on the Respiratory Physiotherapists' (RPTs) role.
32431134,A quick three-days complete reorganization of the entire hospital was needed.
32431134,A COVID-19 care team including a multidisciplinary panel of physicians, nurses, and RPTs was quickly performed to manage 90 beds for post acute patients with COVID-19.
32431134,Within the team, the RPTs changed their shifts, so as to be available 16h per day, 7 days out of 7.
32431134,Remodelled tasks in charge of RPTs were: oxygen therapy daily monitoring, non invasive ventilation (NIV) and continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) delivery, pronation and postural changes to improve oxygenation, reconditioning with leg/arm cranking and exercises, initial and final patients' functional assessment by short-physical performance battery (SPPB) and 1-minute sit-to-stand test (1-STS) to evaluate motor conditions and exercise-induced oxygen desaturation.
32431134,Three &quot;what-to-do&quot; algorithms were developed to guide: i) oxygen de-escalation by reducing inhaled fraction of oxygen (FiO2); ii) oxygenation improvement through the use of Venturi mask; iii) reconditioning and physical activity.
32431134,One-hundred seventy patients were treated in one month.
32431134,As main topics, RPTs have been involved in oxygen therapy management in almost a third of the admitted patients, reconditioning exercises in 60% of the cases, and initial and final functional motor capacity assessment in all patients.
32431134,Details of activities performed by the RPT in one typical working day are also shown.
32431134,Our reorganization has exploited the professional skills and clinical expertise of the RPTs.
32431134,This re-organization can provide practical insights to other facilities that are facing this crisis, and may be a starting point for implementing post-COVID-19 rehabilitation.
32431134,Future studies will have to improve and review this organization.
32431287,Since late December 2019, the world has been challenged with an outbreak of COVID-19.
32431287,In Thailand, an upper middle-income country with a limited healthcare infrastructure and restricted human resources, nearly 3,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases have been reported as of early May 2020.
32431287,Public health policies aimed at preventing new COVID-19 cases were very effective in halting the pandemic in Thailand.
32431287,Case fatality in Thailand has been low (1.7%), at least in part due to early stratification according to risk of disease severity and timely initiation of supportive care with affordable measures.
32431287,We present our initial experience with COVID-19 in Thailand, focusing on several aspects that may have played a crucial role in curtailment of the pandemic, and elements of care for severely ill COVID-19 patients, including stratification, isolation, and affordable diagnostic approaches and supportive care measures.
32431287,We also discuss local considerations concerning some proposed experimental treatments.
32431755,A common complication of viral pulmonary infections, such as in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, is a phenomenon described as a &quot;cytokine storm&quot;.
32431755,While poorly defined, this hyperinflammatory response results in diffuse alveolar damage.
32431755,The low molecular weight fraction of commercial human serum albumin (LMWF5A), a novel biologic in development for osteoarthritis, demonstrates beneficial in vitro immunomodulatory effects complimentary to addressing inflammation, thus, we hypothesize that LMWF5A could improve the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 by attenuating hyperinflammation and the potential development of a cytokine storm.
32431755,A variety of human in vitro immune models indicate that LMWF5A reduces the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines implicated in cytokine storm associated with COVID-19.
32431755,Furthermore, evidence suggests LMWF5A also promotes the production of mediators required for resolving inflammation and enhances the barrier function of endothelial cultures.
32431755,A randomized controlled trial, to evaluate the safety and efficacy of nebulized LMWF5A in adults with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) secondary to COVID-19 infection, was developed and is currently under review by the Food and Drug Administration.
32431755,If successful, this therapy may attenuate the cytokine storm observed in these patients and potentially reduce mortality, increase ventilation free days, improve oxygenation parameters and consequently lessen the burden on patients and the intensive care unit.
32431755,In conclusion, in vitro findings suggest that the immunomodulatory effects of LMWF5A make it a viable candidate for treating cytokine storm and restoring homeostasis to the immune response in COVID-19.
32431756,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic places healthcare workers at risk of exposure to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32431756,Emergency department (ED) staff are particularly vulnerable when managing patients with acute respiratory distress due to the aerosolization of the virus during endotracheal intubation.
32431756,A simple and innovative intubation tent was designed with the intent of decreasing the risk of accidental viral transmission from emergent intubations during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32431756,The materials and assembly process of the novel &quot;Corona Curtain&quot; are described in technical detail, with the intent of allowing other providers to template the concept at their respective facilities.
32431756,A total of 36 intubation tents were mounted in the ED at the Medical Center of Aurora, Colorado, on April 7, 2020, and thereafter consistently used for all intubations during the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.
32431756,The cost of raw materials and labor for the initial assembly averaged US $ 8.00 per construct.
32431756,The price of the single-use plastic cover is variable depending on the vendor source.
32431756,The new &quot;Corona Curtain&quot; was designed to improve the safety of ED staff when performing urgent/emergent intubations during the current COVID-19 pandemic.
32431756,The concept can easily be adopted to other patient care areas, including perioperative and intensive care units.
32431756,Future validation studies are needed to determine the safety and efficacy of the intubation tents by quantifying the pre-/post-intubation exposure through &quot;point-of-care&quot; SARS-CoV-2 testing once these resources are more widely available.
32431992,Novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a severe respiratory infection leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) accounting for thousands of cases and deaths across the world.
32431992,Several alternatives in treatment options have been assessed and used in this patient population.
32431992,However, when mechanical ventilation and prone positioning are unsuccessful, venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) may be used.
32431992,We present a case of a 41-year-old female, with no significant medical history and no recent history of exposure to sick contacts, presented to the emergency department (ED) with fever, severe shortness of breath, and flu-like symptoms with a positive COVID-19 test.
32431992,Ultimately, she worsened on mechanical ventilation and prone positioning and required VV-ECMO.
32431992,The use of VV-ECMO in COVID-19 infected patients is still controversial.
32431992,While some studies have shown a high mortality rate despite aggressive treatment, such as in our case, the lack of large sample size studies and treatment alternatives places healthcare providers against a wall without options in patients with severe refractory ARDS due to COVID-19.
32432121,<b>Objective:</b> To explore the clinical characteristics and dynamic follow-up changes of high resolution CT (HRCT) in 270 patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. <b>Methods:</b> Two hundred seventy COVID-19 pneumonia patients were retrospectively analyzed, including 146 males and 124 females, with median age of 51 (9,89).
32432121,The clinical features, laboratory examination indexes and HRCT evolution findings of 270 COVID-19 pneumonia patients were analyzed. <b>Results:</b> 264 cases (95.74%) were positive at the first time nucleic acid test, 6 cases (2.22%) were negative, after multiple inspections, 270 cases (100%) were positive.
32432121,According to the number of lung segments involved in the lesion, the lesions range from &lt;30% of the lung area (Common type), 30-50% (Severe type), and&gt; 50% (Critical type).
32432121,At the first CT exam, 136 cases (50.37%) of the common type, 89 cases (32.96%) of the severe type and 45 cases (16.67%) of the critical type.
32432121,At the second CT exam, 84 cases (31.11%) of the common type, 103 cases (38.15%) of the severe type and 83 cases (30.74%) of the critical type.
32432121,In the third CT exam, there were 151 cases (55.93%) of the common type, 86 cases (31.85%) of the severe type and 33 cases (12.22%) of the critical type.
32432121,The differences in image typing were statistically significant (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05).
32432121,During this study, a total of 173 patients (64.08%) were recovered after treatment. <b>Conclusion:</b> In some epidemiological backgrounds, CT imaging manifestations and evolutionary characteristics are of great significance for early warning of lung injury, assessment of disease severity, and assistance in clinical typing and post-treatment follow-up.
32432127,The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented challenge and will require novel therapeutic strategies.
32432127,Affected patients are likely to be at risk of arrhythmia due to underlying comorbidities, polypharmacy and the disease process.
32432127,Importantly, a number of the medications likely to receive significant use can themselves, particularly in combination, be pro-arrhythmic.
32432127,Drug-induced prolongation of the QT interval is primarily caused by inhibition of the hERG potassium channel either directly and/or by impaired channel trafficking.
32432127,Concurrent use of multiple hERG-blocking drugs may have a synergistic rather than additive effect which, in addition to any pre-existing polypharmacy, critical illness or electrolyte imbalance, may significantly increase the risk of arrhythmia and Torsades de Pointes.
32432127,Knowledge of these risks will allow informed decisions regarding appropriate therapeutics and monitoring to keep our patients safe.
32432389,The COVID-19 pandemic has led to disorder in work and livelihood of a majority of the modern world.
32432389,In this work, we review its major impacts on procedures and workflow of clinical physics tasks, and suggest alternate pathways to avoid major disruption or discontinuity of physics tasks in the context of small, medium, and large radiation oncology clinics.
32432389,We also evaluate scalability of medical physics under the stress of &quot;social distancing&quot;.
32432389,Three models of facilities characterized by the number of clinical physicists, daily patient throughput, and equipment were identified for this purpose.
32432389,For identical objectives of continuity of clinical operations, with constraints such as social distancing and unavailability of staff due to system strain, however with the possibility of remote operations, the performance of these models was investigated.
32432389,General clinical tasks requiring on-site personnel presence or otherwise were evaluated to determine the scalability of the three models at this point in the course of disease spread within their surroundings.
32432389,The clinical physics tasks within three models could be divided into two categories.
32432389,The former, which requires individual presence, include safety-sensitive radiation delivery, high dose per fraction treatments, brachytherapy procedures, fulfilling state and nuclear regulatory commission's requirements, etc.
32432389,The latter, which can be handled through remote means, include dose planning, physics plan review and supervision of quality assurance, general troubleshooting, etc.
32432389,CONCLUSION: At the current level of disease in the United States, all three models have sustained major system stress in continuing reduced operation.
32432389,However, the small clinic model may not perform if either the current level of infections is maintained for long or staff becomes unavailable due to health issues.
32432389,With abundance, and diversity of innovative resources, medium and large clinic models can sustain further for physics-related radiotherapy services.
32432445,The etiology of injury in COVID-19 patients is diverse and multifactorial.
32432445,Autopsy and biopsy studies reveal, alongside podocyte and tubular cell anomalies, the presence of virion within the cells.
32432445,Evidence suggests that, in addition to the direct cytopathic effect of SARS- CoV2 on the glomeruli and renal tubules, there is also the indirect effect of cell-mediated immunity, the cytokines storm and the cross-talk between organs with possible systemic effects of the disease.
32432445,These mechanisms are interconnected and have profound therapeutic implications involving extracorporeal removal of inflammatory cytokines.
32432445,Dialysis patients, and children, in particular, should be classified as &quot;at high risk&quot; of contracting the disease.
32432445,Infections are one of the most frequent causes of death in children with chronic renal failure who undergo dialysis.
32432445,The reasons for this particular susceptibility are to be found in the compromised immune system, secondary to chronic malnutrition, immunosuppressive therapy, and uremia, frequent contact with healthcare personnel and other patients attending the dialysis unit and in need of the presence of other family members during treatment.
32432527,Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has sparked much interest in the therapeutics of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
32432527,Its antiviral properties have been studied for years; regarding the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Corona Virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), it has been shown that HCQ may act at multiple levels.
32432527,These extend from the initial attachment of the virus to the respiratory epithelium to the inhibition of its replication by the alkalinisation of the phagolysosome's microenvironment and the post-translational modification of certain viral proteins.
32432527,Preliminary clinical evidence from China and France showed significant virological and clinical benefit in HCQ-treated patients, while other studies, mostly including critically ill patients, did not show favorable results.
32432527,In this review, we critically appraise the existing evidence on HCQ against SARS-CoV-2 with particular emphasis on its protective and therapeutic role.
32432527,Safety concerns that are relevant to the short-term HCQ use are also discussed.
32432527,In the context of the rapid evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic that strains the health care systems worldwide and considering limited population-wide testing rates in most of the vulnerable countries, early empiric short-term administration of HCQ in symptomatic individuals, may be a promising, safe and low-cost strategy.
32432995,During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, infectious disease control is of utmost importance in acute stroke treatment.
32432995,This is a new situation for most stroke teams that often leads to uncertainty among physicians, nurses, and technicians who are in immediate contact with patients.
32432995,The situation is made even more complicated by numerous new regulations and protocols that are released in rapid succession.
32432995,Herein, we are describing our experience with simulation training for COVID-19 stroke treatment protocols.
32432995,One week of simulation training allowed us to identify numerous latent safety threats and to adjust our institution-specific protocols to mitigate them.
32432995,It also helped our physicians and nurses to practice relevant tasks and behavioral patterns (eg, proper donning and doffing PPE, where to dispose potentially contaminated equipment) to minimize their infectious exposure and to adapt to the new situation.
32432995,We therefore strongly encourage other hospitals to adopt simulation training to prepare their medical teams for code strokes during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32432998,The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic represents a global public health crisis, disrupting emergency healthcare services.
32432998,We determined whether COVID-19 has resulted in delays in stroke presentation and affected the delivery of acute stroke services in a comprehensive stroke center in Hong Kong.
32432998,We retrospectively reviewed all patients with transient ischemic attack and stroke admitted via the acute stroke pathway of Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong, during the first 60 days since the first diagnosed COVID-19 case in Hong Kong (COVID-19: January 23, 2020-March 24, 2020).
32432998,We compared the stroke onset to hospital arrival (onset-to-door) time and timings of inpatient stroke pathways with patients admitted during the same period in 2019 (pre-COVID-19: January 23, 2019-March 24, 2019).
32432998,Seventy-three patients in COVID-19 were compared with 89 patients in pre-COVID-19.
32432998,There were no significant differences in age, sex, vascular risk factors, nor stroke severity between the 2 groups (<i>P</i>&gt;0.05).
32432998,The median stroke onset-to-door time was ≈1-hour longer in COVID-19 compared with pre-COVID-19 (154 versus 95 minutes, <i>P</i>=0.12), and the proportion of individuals with onset-to-door time within 4.5 hours was significantly lower (55% versus 72%, <i>P</i>=0.024).
32432998,Significantly fewer cases of transient ischemic attack presented to the hospital during COVID-19 (4% versus 16%, <i>P</i>=0.016), despite no increase in referrals to the transient ischemic attack clinic.
32432998,Inpatient stroke pathways and treatment time metrics nevertheless did not differ between the 2 groups (<i>P</i>&gt;0.05 for all comparisons).
32432998,During the early containment phase of COVID-19, we noted a prolongation in stroke onset to hospital arrival time and a significant reduction in individuals arriving at the hospital within 4.5 hours and presenting with transient ischemic attack.
32432998,Public education about stroke should continue to be reinforced during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32433010,The 2019 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) continues to expand worldwide.
32433010,Although the number of cases and the death rate among children and adolescents are reported to be low compared to adults, limited data have been reported.
32433010,We urgently need to find treatment and vaccine to stop the epidemic.
32433010,Vaccine development is in progress, but any approved and effective vaccine for COVID-19 is at least 12 to 18 months.
32433010,The World Health Organization (WHO), the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) have issued instructions and strategies for containing COVID-19 outbreak to the general public, physicians, travelers and injured patients to follow so that the transmission to a healthy population can be prevented.
32433010,In this review, we summarize demographic data, clinical characteristics, complications and outcomes and finally prevention and control of this serious pandemic.
32433217,Approximately 3 billion people around the world have gone into some form of social separation to mitigate the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
32433217,The uncontrolled influx of patients in need of emergency care has rapidly brought several national health systems to near-collapse with deadly consequences to those afflicted by COVID-19 and other critical diseases associated with COVID-19.
32433217,Solid scientific evidence regarding SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 remains scarce; there is an urgent need to expand our understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 pathophysiology to facilitate precise and targeted treatments.
32433217,The capacity for rapid information dissemination has emerged as a double-edged sword; the existing gap of high-quality data is frequently filled by anecdotal reports, contradictory statements and misinformation.
32433217,This review addresses several important aspects unique to the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic highlighting the most relevant knowledge gaps and existing windows-of-opportunity.
32433217,Specifically, focus is given to SARS-CoV-2 immunopathogenesis in the context of experimental therapies and pre-clinical evidence and their applicability in supporting efficacious clinical trial planning.
32433217,The review discusses the existing challenges of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics and the potential application of translational technology for epidemiological predictions, patient monitoring and treatment decision-making in COVID-19.
32433217,Furthermore, solutions for enhancing international strategies in translational research, cooperative networks and regulatory partnerships are contemplated.
32433248,Healthcare systems are belligerently responding to the new Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32433248,The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS co-V2) is a specific condition, whose distinctive features are severe hypoxemia associated with (&gt;50% of cases) normal respiratory system compliance.
32433248,When a patient requires intubation and invasive ventilation the outcome is poor and the length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) is usually two or three weeks.
32433248,In this manuscript, authors will review several technological devices, which could support healthcare providers at the bedside to optimise the care for COVID-19 patients who are sedated, paralysed and ventilated.
32433248,Particular attention is provided to the use of video-laryngoscopes (VL) because these can assist anaesthetists to perform a successful intubation outside the ICU while protecting healthcare providers from this viral infection.
32433248,Authors will also review processed electroencephalographic (EEG) monitors which are used to better titrate sedation and the train of four monitors which are utilised to better titrate neuromuscular blocking agents in the view of sparing limited pharmacological resources.
32433248,COVID-19 can rapidly exhaust human and technological resources too within the ICU.
32433248,This review features a series of technological advancements that can significantly improve the care of patients requiring isolation.
32433248,The working conditions in isolation could cause gaps or barriers in communication, fatigue and poor documentation of provided care.
32433248,The available technology has several advantages including: a) facilitating appropriate paperless documentation and communication between all healthcare givers working in isolation rooms or large isolation areas; b) testing patients and staff at the bedside using smart point of care diagnostics (SPOCD) to confirm COVID-19 infection; c) allowing diagnostics and treatment at the bedside through point of care ultrasound (POCUS) and Thromboelastography (TEG); d) adapting the use of anaesthetic machines and the use of volatile anaesthetics.
32433248,Implementing technologies for safeguarding healthcare providers as well as monitoring the limited pharmacological resources is paramount.
32433248,Only by leveraging new technologies it will be possible to sustain and support healthcare systems during the expected long course of this pandemic.
32433291,: Treatment of the COVID-19 critically ill patient requires oxygenation and ventilation support for prolonged periods which seem unique for viral pneumonia.
32433291,The pathophysiology of COVID-19 critical illness is being revealed on a day to day basis at the frontlines of care in the intensive care unit with this new disease.
32433291,High density consolidations in the bronchial tree and in the pulmonary parenchyma have been described in the advanced phase of the disease.
32433291,Our team has observed impeded ventilation in intubated patients who are several days into the critical course due to what seems to be tissue sloughing with resultant endotracheal tube obstruction and the consequences thereof.
32433291,Caregivers need to be aware of this pathological finding, recognize, and to treat this aspect of the COVID-19 critical illness course, which is becoming more prevalent.
32433343,A novel infectious disease, Coronavirus disease -2019 (COVID-19), spread globally since Dec.
32433343,2019.
32433343,Without effective treatment and vaccination, the strategies to restrain this disease is only keeping social distance, maintaining personal hygiene, quarantine and isolation.
32433343,However, thrice-a-week treatment is inevitable for all hemodialysis patients.
32433343,In addition to the high risk of cluster infection and compromised immunity in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), an atypical disease presentation could also make the medial system neglect these patients during CVOID-19 pandemic.
32433343,To avoid COVID-19 transmission among dialysis patients, the major societies of nephrology around the world have provided their guidelines of screening, dialysis facilities adjustment, and health education, respectively.
32433343,In this review, we summarized the main contents and difference of these guidelines and addressed the prompt management for ESRD patients to reduce the risk of infection during COVID-19 pandemic.
32433345,Recently, the SARS-CoV-2 was quickly identified as the causal pathogen leading to the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome-like illness all over the world.
32433345,As the SARS-CoV-2 infection pandemic proceeds, many efforts are being dedicated to the development of diverse treatment strategies.
32433345,Increasing evidence showed potential therapeutic agents directly acting against SARS-CoV-2 virus, such as interferon, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitors, protease inhibitors, viral entry blockers, neuraminidase inhibitor, vaccine, antibody agent targeting the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome, natural killer cells and nucleocytoplasmic trafficking inhibitor.
32433345,To date, several direct anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents have demonstrated promising in vitro and clinical efficacy.
32433345,This article reviews the current and future development of direct acting agents against SARS-CoV-2.
32433363,: The United States is currently in the midst of 2 public health emergencies: COVID-19 and the ongoing opioid crisis.
32433363,In an attempt to reduce preventable harm to individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD), federal, state, and local governments have temporarily modified law and policy to increase access to OUD treatment and divert some individuals at high risk away from the correctional system.
32433363,In this Commentary, we briefly describe how people with OUD are at increased risk for COVID-19, discuss existing policy barriers to evidence-based prevention and treatment for individuals with OUD, explain the temporary rollbacks of those barriers, and argue that these changes should be made permanent.
32433363,We also suggest several additional steps that federal and state governments can urgently take to reduce barriers to care for individuals with OUD, both during the current crisis and beyond.
32433364,To reduce the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), many substance use disorder treatment programs have transitioned to telemedicine.
32433364,Emergency regulatory changes allow buprenorphine initiation without an in-person visit.
32433364,We describe the use of videoconferencing for buprenorphine initiation combined with street outreach to engage 2 patients experiencing homelessness with severe opioid use disorder (OUD).
32433364,Patient 1 was a 30-year-old man with severe OUD who had relapsed to injection heroin/fentanyl after incarceration.
32433364,A community drop-in center outreach harm reduction specialist facilitated a videoconference with an addiction specialist at an OUD bridge clinic.
32433364,The patient completed a community buprenorphine/naloxone initiation and self-titrated to his prior dose, 8/2 mg twice daily.
32433364,One week later, he reconnected with the outreach team for a follow-up videoconference visit.
32433364,Patient 2, a 36-year-old man with severe OUD, connected to the addiction specialist via a syringe service program harm reduction specialist.
32433364,He had been trying to connect to a community buprenorphine/naloxone provider, but access was limited due to COVID-19, so he was using diverted buprenorphine/naloxone to reduce opioid use.
32433364,He was restarted on his previous dose of 12/3 mg daily which was continued via phone follow-up 16 days later.
32433364,COVID-19-related regulatory changes allow buprenorphine initiation via telemedicine.
32433364,We describe 2 cases where telemedicine was combined with street outreach to connect patients experiencing homelessness with OUD to treatment.
32433364,These cases highlight an important opportunity to provide access to life-saving OUD treatment for vulnerable patients in the setting of a pandemic that mandates reduced face-to-face clinical interactions.
32433765,The emergence of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has required an unprecedented response to control the spread of the infection and protect the most vulnerable within society.
32433765,Whilst the pandemic has focused society on the threat of emerging infections and hand hygiene, certain infection control and antimicrobial stewardship policies may have to be relaxed.
32433765,It is unclear whether the unintended consequences of these changes will have a net-positive or -negative impact on rates of antimicrobial resistance.
32433765,Whilst the urgent focus must be on controlling this pandemic, sustained efforts to address the longer-term global threat of antimicrobial resistance should not be overlooked.
32434108,At the end of January 2020, a novel betacoronavirus, known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, progressively spread in Italy.
32434108,Patients with cancer are considered more prone to infections because of the immunosuppressive status due to both malignancy and anticancer treatments.
32434108,From the first Italian government restrictions (23rd February), Modena Cancer Center adopted practical health vigilance recommendations to minimise the risk of exposure to the virus without overlooking cancer management.
32434108,From 23rd February to 31st March 2020, 1257 patients on active anticancer treatment for oncological or haematological malignancies attended our institution.
32434108,All the staff activities were rescheduled following our practical coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) guideline.
32434108,During this period, we have tallied 9 cases of COVID-19 infection (0.71%) in patients with cancer and 3 cases (1.66%) in health workers.
32434108,The mortality rate of our patients with cancer was 22%, consistent with the data reported in the literature.
32434108,In conclusion, following our practical health vigilance recommendations, physicians should be confident in maintaining life-saving anticancer treatment without exceedingly increasing the risk of nosocomial COVID-19 infection.
32434108,The high rate of mortality suggested that all patients on active anticancer treatment with flu-like symptoms have to be carefully screened for COVID-19 infection.
32434211,In December 2019, the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province, China<sup>1</sup> and soon spread across the world.
32434211,In this ongoing pandemic, public health concerns and the urgent need for effective therapeutic measures require a deep understanding of its epidemiology, transmissibility and pathogenesis.
32434211,Here we analyzed the clinical, molecular and immunological data from 326 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Shanghai.
32434211,Genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 assembled from 112 quality samples together with sequences in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) showed a stable evolution and suggested two major lineages with differential exposure history during the early phase of the outbreak in Wuhan.
32434211,Nevertheless, they exhibited similar virulence and clinical outcomes.
32434211,Lymphocytopenia, especially the reduced CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell counts upon admission, was predictive of disease progression.
32434211,High levels of IL-6 and IL-8 during treatment were observed in patients with severe or critical disease and correlated with decreased lymphocyte count.
32434211,The determinants of disease severity seemed to stem mostly from host factors such as age, lymphocytopenia, and its associated cytokine storm, whereas viral genetic variation did not significantly affect the outcomes.
32434272,Despite the ferment aroused in the scientific community by the COVID-19 outbreak and the over 11,000 papers listed in PubMed, published evidence on safe and effective drugs has not progressed yet at the same speed of the pandemic.
32434272,However, clinical research is rapidly progressing, as shown by the hundreds of registered clinical trials on candidate drugs for COVID-19.
32434272,Unfortunately, information on protocols of individual studies differs from registry to registry.
32434272,Furthermore, study designs, criteria for stratification of patients and choice of outcomes are quite heterogeneous.
32434272,All this makes data sharing and secondary analysis difficult.At last, small single centre studies and the use of drugs on a compassionate basis should be replaced by highly powered, multi-centre, multi-arm clinical trials, in orderto provide the required evidence of safety and efficacy of novel or repurposed candidate drugs.
32434272,Hopefully, the efforts of clinical researchers in the fight against the SARS Cov-2 will result into the identification of effective treatments.
32434272,To make this possible, clinical research should be oriented by guidelines for more harmonized high-quality studies and by a united commitment of the scientific community to share personal knowledge and data.
32434272,Allergists and clinical immunologists should have a leading role in this unprecedent challenge.
32434314,COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly spreading all over the world, creating the risk for an healthcare collapse.
32434314,While acute care and intensive care units are the main pillars of the early response to the disease, rehabilitative medicine should play an important part in allowing COVID-19 survivors to reduce disability and optimize the function of acute hospital setting.
32434314,To share the experience and the international perspective of different rehabilitation centers, treating COVID-19 survivors.
32434314,Not applicable.
32434314,COVID-19 survivors.
32434314,A group of Physical Medicine &amp; Rehabilitation specialists from eleven different countries in Europe and North America have shared their clinical experience in dealing with COVID-19 survivors and how they have managed the re-organization of rehabilitation services.
32434314,In our experience the most important sequelae of severe and critical forms of COVID-19 are: 1) respiratory; 2) cognitive, central and peipheral nervous system; 3) deconditioning; 4) critical illness related myopathy and neuropathy; 5) dysphagia; 6) joint stiffness and pain; 7) psychiatric.
32434314,We analyze all these consequences and propose some practical treatment options, based on current evidence and clinical experience, as well as several suggestions for management of rehabilitation services and patients with suspected or confirmed infection by SARS-CoV-2.
32434314,COVID-19 survivors have some specific rehabilitation needs.
32434314,Experience from other centers may help colleagues in organizing their services and providing better care to their patients.
32434337,By the end of 2019 the first cases of severe pneumonia of unknown origin were reported in Wuhan, China.
32434337,The causative agent was identified as a novel b-coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and the disease was named COVID-19.
32434337,Since the beginning of 2020, the infection has spread worldwide, which led the WHO to declare COVID-19 a public health emergency of international concern and to characterize the current situation as a pandemic.
32434337,The transmission occurs mainly via respiratory droplets and the incubation period ranges from 2 to 14 days.
32434337,Most cases are mild, but some patients develop severe pneumonia with acute respiratory distress, septic shock and multi-organ failure.
32434337,The most common symptoms include fever, dry cough, myalgia and shortness of breath.
32434337,Characteristic laboratory findings are normal white blood cell count or mild leukopenia, marked lymphopenia, in severe cases elevated CRP, procalcitonin, LDH, and D-dimer are commonly found.
32434337,Typical imaging findings include multifocal peripherally distributed ground-glass opacities or consolidations, interlobular septal thickening, crazy paving appearance and cystic changes.
32434337,The overall case fatality rate is estimated to range from 1 to 3 %, however, it is dependent on age and underlying medical comorbidities.
32434337,Current potential treatment options include hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir and convalescent plasma.
32434338,COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
32434338,COVID-19 has a number of similarities to SARS and MERS diseases.
32434338,Its highly contagious nature is particularly due to the rapid spread of the disease through asymptomatic individuals; however, the worlds most contagious infectious disease is still considered measles.
32434338,Scientific data have revealed the interactions between COVID-19 and the immune system.
32434338,These findings may contribute to the development of novel preventive and therapeutic approaches.
32434338,Just as coronavirus itself the reports about the disease have massively spread through media and public contributing to overall public fear and stress.
32434338,This promotion of non-scientific evidence and misinformation through social media might have also a devastating impact on the individuals immune system.
32434338,Data regarding the mortality rates of COVID-19 have achieved unprecedented media and public engagements, however, the true facts about the disease prevention, immunomodulation and novel treatments are often left unsaid.
32434338,We present the most recent facts about COVID-19 disease and its interactions with the immune system.
32434402,The current ongoing pandemic outbreak of COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) has globally affected 213 countries and territories with more than 2.5 million confirmed cases and thousands of casualties.
32434402,The unpredictable and uncertain COVID-19 outbreak has the potential of adversely affecting the psychological health on individual and community level.
32434402,Currently all efforts are focused on the understanding of epidemiology, clinical features, mode of transmission, counteract the spread of the virus, and challenges of global health, while crucially significant mental health has been overlooked in this endeavor.
32434402,This review is to evaluate past outbreaks to understand the extent of adverse effects on psychological health, psychological crisis intervention, and mental health management plans.
32434402,Published previous and current articles on PubMed, EMBASE, Google Scholar, and Elsevier about psychological impact of infectious diseases outbreaks and COVID-19 has been considered and reviewed.
32434402,COVID-19 is leading to intense psychosocial issues and comprising mental health marking a secondary health concern all around the world.
32434402,Globally implementing preventive and controlling measures, and cultivating coping and resilience are challenging factors; modified lifestyle (lockdown curfew, self-isolation, social distancing and quarantine); conspiracy theories, misinformation and disinformation about the origin, scale, signs, symptoms, transmission, prevention and treatment; global socioeconomic crisis; travel restrictions; workplace hazard control; postponement and cancellation of religious, sports, cultural and entertainment events; panic buying and hoarding; incidents of racism, xenophobia, discrimination, stigma, psychological pressure of productivity, marginalization and violence; overwhelmed medical centers and health organizations, and general impact on education, politics, socioeconomic, culture, environment and climate - are some of the risk factors to aggravate further problems.
32434596,The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the traditional practice of psychiatric assessment and treatment via face to face interaction.
32434596,Telepsychiatry, the delivery of psychiatric care remotely through telecommunications technology, is an existing and under-utilised tool that may help to minimise disruption to patient care.
32434596,Technological advancement is at a stage where it can facilitate widespread use of this practice; however concerns that limited its expansion previously were not unfounded.
32434596,This article discusses the use of telepsychiatry in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.
32434606,Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder is the commonest disorder presenting to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services in Ireland.
32434606,ADMiRE is a specialist ADHD service in South Dublin that provides assessment and intervention for &gt;200 children and adolescents with ADHD.The first section of this article considers the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the provision of mental health services for young people with ADHD with specific reference to the difficulties that have been experienced in ADMiRE since the outbreak of Covid-19 in Ireland.
32434606,In ADMiRE, there has been a significant reduction of face to face consultations, postponement of new assessments, difficulties with physical monitoring, delays in medication initiation, suspension of medication titration, lack of group interventions and problems with access to controlled drug prescriptions.
32434606,Current guidelines and alternative ways of ensuring adequate service provision are discussed.Restrictions to mitigate the spread of Covid-19 are likely to continue for many months, and child and adolescent mental health services need to find new ways to provide a sustainable service to young people in Ireland.
32434606,There is a growing evidence base for telepsychiatry, the use of technology such as video conferencing to deliver mental health care remotely, and this approach may be particularly useful in assessment and management of ADHD.
32434606,The second section of this article discusses the evidence base for telepsychiatry in ADHD, and outlines factors that should be considered when developing a telepsychiatry service for children and adolescents with ADHD.
32434611,In the last three decades, Early Intervention for psychosis services have been established worldwide and have resulted in superior symptomatic and functional outcomes for people affected by psychotic disorders.
32434611,These improved outcomes are a result of reducing delays to treatment and the provision of specialized, holistic interventions.
32434611,The covid-19 pandemic poses significant challenges to the delivery of these services, such as undetected cases or long delays to treatment.
32434611,Furthermore, the covid-19 pandemic will likely increase the mental health needs of communities, including the incidence of psychotic disorders.
32434611,In this perspective piece, we provide suggestions as to how early intervention for psychosis services can adapt within this environment, such as utilizing novel technologies.
32434611,Finally, we argue that despite the economic consequences of the pandemic, the funding for mental health services, including early intervention services, should be increased in line with the need for these services during and beyond the pandemic.
32434627,Specialised rehabilitation units offer inpatient multi-disciplinary rehabilitation for individuals with severe and enduring mental illness.
32434627,A cornerstone of therapy is the work in the community through further education and community organisations.
32434627,However, coronavirus restrictions has meant that such external supports are no longer available for the duration of the crisis.
32434627,This has led to opportunities for developing new ways of offering rehabilitation within hospital environments.
32434627,This article describes some of the new initiatives developed.
32434627,The benefits of the lockdown for service users is also discussed.
32434627,Many found the cessation of visits from family members with whom they had an ambivalent relationship.
32434627,The lockdown improved relationships between patients on the unit and encouraged a greater feeling of community.
32434627,The lockdown has also emphasised the importance of team self-awareness and an awareness of the nature of the treatments offered.
32434632,Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China, the public-facility-turned temporary hospital (PFTH) has played an important role in preventing the spread of the epidemic.
32434632,Wuchang PFTH is the first one to put into clinical practice and the last one suspended in Wuhan.
32434632,The National Emergency Medical Rescue Team of the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, together with other 13 medical teams (841 medical staff in total), have fulfilled the task for the treatment of non-severe COVID-19 patients, without any medical staff infected.
32434632,The first author of the article was the only pediatrician working in the Wuchang PFTH.
32434632,The author describes and summarizes the features/functions, management/operations, and advantages/challenges of the PFTH, in order to provide reference for medical institutions and relevant departments to deal with public health emergencies.
32434634,To study the clinical features of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children aged &lt;18 years.
32434634,A retrospective analysis was performed from the medical data of 23 children, aged from 3 months to 17 years and 8 months, who were diagnosed with COVID-19 in Jiangxi, China from January 21 to February 29, 2020.
32434634,Of the 23 children with COVID-19, 17 had family aggregation.
32434634,Three children (13%) had asymptomatic infection, 6 (26%) had mild type, and 14 (61%) had common type.
32434634,Among these 23 children, 16 (70%) had fever, 11 (48%) had cough, 8 (35%) had fever and cough, and 8 (35%) had wet rales in the lungs.
32434634,The period from disease onset or the first nucleic acid-positive detection of SARS-CoV-2 to the virus nucleic acid negative conversion was 6-24 days (median 12 days).
32434634,Of the 23 children, 3 had a reduction in total leukocyte count, 2 had a reduction in lymphocytes, 2 had an increase in C-reactive protein, and 2 had an increase in D-dimer.
32434634,Abnormal pulmonary CT findings were observed in 12 children, among whom 9 had patchy ground-glass opacities in both lungs.
32434634,All 23 children received antiviral therapy and were recovered.
32434634,COVID-19 in children aged &lt;18 years often occurs with family aggregation, with no specific clinical manifestation and laboratory examination results.
32434634,Most of these children have mild symptoms and a good prognosis.
32434634,Epidemiological history is of particular importance in the diagnosis of COVID-19 in children aged &lt;18 years.
32434635,This article reports the diagnosis and treatment of two children with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and hypertension.
32434635,Case 1 was a boy aged 13 years and 3 months, with the main manifestations of fever and dry cough; chest CT showed ground-glass opacities, and the nucleic acid test of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) yielded a positive result.
32434635,Case 2 was a boy aged 13 years and 8 months and had no clinical symptoms; chest CT showed no abnormality, while the nucleic acid test of SARS-CoV-2 yielded a positive result.
32434635,Both cases were shown with family aggregation of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32434635,They had obesity and a family history of hypertension.
32434635,Continuous blood pressure monitoring in the resting state during hospitalization showed that blood pressure was above the 95% reference interval of normal value for children of the same age, and the two boys were given calcium channel blockers or β-receptor blockers and were then recovered.
32434635,It is concluded that comprehensive management of children with COVID-19 and underlying cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension, should be taken seriously during the epidemic.
32434728,The COVID-19 pandemic has required the adaptation of hyperacute stroke care (including stroke code pathways) and hospital stroke management.
32434728,There remains a need to provide rapid and comprehensive assessment to acute stroke patients while reducing the risk of COVID-19 exposure, protecting healthcare providers, and preserving personal protective equipment (PPE) supplies.
32434728,While the COVID infection is typically not a primary cerebrovascular condition, the downstream effects of this pandemic force adjustments to stroke care pathways to maintain optimal stroke patient outcomes.
32434728,The University of California San Diego (UCSD) Health System encompasses two academic, Comprehensive Stroke Centers (CSCs).
32434728,The UCSD Stroke Center reviewed the national COVID-19 crisis and implications on stroke care.
32434728,All current resources for stroke care were identified and adapted to include COVID-19 screening.
32434728,The adjusted model focused on comprehensive and rapid acute stroke treatment, reduction of exposure to the healthcare team, and preservation of PPE.
32434728,The adjusted pathways implement telestroke assessments as a specific option for all inpatient and outpatient encounters and accounts for when telemedicine systems are not available or functional.
32434728,COVID screening is done on all stroke patients.
32434728,We outline a model of hyperacute stroke evaluation in an adapted stroke code protocol and novel methods of stroke patient management.
32434728,The overall goal of the model is to preserve patient access and outcomes while decreasing potential COVID-19 exposure to patients and healthcare providers.
32434728,This model also serves to reduce the use of vital PPE.
32434728,It is critical that stroke providers share best practices via academic and vetted social media platforms for rapid dissemination of tools and care models during the COVID-19 crisis.
32434770,In the time of COVID-19, predictive molecular pathology laboratories must still timely select oncological patients for targeted treatments.
32434770,However, the need to respect social distancing measures may delay results generated by laboratory-developed tests based on sequential steps a long hands-on time.
32434770,Laboratory workflows should now be simplified.
32434770,The organisation of the University of Naples Federico II predictive pathology laboratory was assessed before (March-April 2019) and during (March-April 2020) the Italian lockdown.
32434770,The number of patients undergoing single or multiple biomarker testing was similar in 2019 (n=43) and in 2020 (n=45).
32434770,Considering adequate samples for molecular testing, before the outbreak, next-generation sequencing was mostly used (35/42, 83.3%).
32434770,Testing six genes had a reagent cost of €98/patient.
32434770,Conversely, in 2020, almost all cases (38/41, 92.7%) were analysed by automated testing.
32434770,This latter had for any single assay/gene a significant reagent cost (€95-€136) and a faster mean turnaround time (5.3 vs 7.9 working days).
32434770,In the times of coronavirus, laboratory fully automated platforms simplify predictive molecular testing.
32434770,Laboratory staff may be more safely and cost-effectively managed.
32434788,Cases of the 2019 novel coronavirus also known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continue to rise worldwide.
32434788,To date, there is no effective treatment.
32434788,Clinical management is largely symptomatic, with organ support in intensive care for critically ill patients.
32434788,The first phase I trial to test the efficacy of a vaccine has recently begun, but in the meantime there is an urgent need to decrease the morbidity and mortality of severe cases.
32434788,It is known that patients with cancer are more susceptible to infection than individuals without cancer because of their systemic immunosuppressive state caused by the malignancy and anticancer treatments.
32434788,Therefore, these patients might be at increased risk of pulmonary complications from COVID-19.
32434788,The SARS-CoV-2 could in some case induce excessive and aberrant non-effective host immune responses that are associated with potentially fatal severe lung injury and patients can develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
32434788,Cytokine release syndrome and viral ARDS result from uncontrolled severe acute inflammation.
32434788,Acute lung injury results from inflammatory monocyte and macrophage activation in the pulmonary luminal epithelium which lead to a release of proinflammatory cytokines including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor-α.
32434788,These cytokines play a crucial role in immune-related pneumonitis, and could represent a promising target when the infiltration is T cell predominant or there are indirect signs of high IL-6-related inflammation, such as elevated C-reactive protein.
32434788,A monoclonal anti-IL-6 receptor antibody, tocilizumab has been administered in a number of cases in China and Italy.
32434788,Positive clinical and radiological outcomes have been reported.
32434788,These early findings have led to an ongoing randomized controlled clinical trial in China and Italy.
32434788,While data from those trials are eagerly awaited, patients' management will continue to rely for the vast majority on local guidelines.
32434788,Among many other aspects, this crisis has proven that different specialists must join forces to deliver the best possible care to patients.
32434789,Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) can produce specific immune-related adverse events including pneumonitis.
32434789,The impact of ICI therapy on the severity of acute coronavirus infection symptomatology warrants further exploration.
32434789,We report a 65-year-old man diagnosed with stage IV melanoma who developed pulmonary and brain metastases and was treated with bilateral craniotomies followed by combined nivolumab and ipilimumab immunotherapy.
32434789,He developed early-onset severe dyspnea associated with acute coronavirus HKU1 (non-COVID-19) infection, with diffuse pneumonitis evidenced by ground glass opacification on CT scan.
32434789,He was treated with steroids leading to resolution of pneumonitis on repeat imaging, suggesting an exacerbated immune-mediated toxicity.
32434789,We report the first case of a patient with melanoma with severe and reversible diffuse pneumonitis in association with coronavirus HKU1 following combined nivolumab and ipilimumab immunotherapy.
32434789,Although we do not have data on the impact of ICI therapy on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) symptomatology, a possible interaction should be considered when deciding on dosing in patients with possible SARS-CoV-2 exposure or when evaluating patients with presumed ICI-related pneumonitis during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32434790,COVID-19 infections are characterized by inflammation of the lungs and other organs that ranges from mild and asymptomatic to fulminant and fatal.
32434790,Patients who are immunocompromised and those with cardiopulmonary comorbidities appear to be particularly afflicted by this illness.
32434790,During pandemic conditions, many aspects of cancer care have been impacted.
32434790,One important clinical question is how to manage patients who need anticancer therapy, including immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) during these conditions.
32434790,Herein, we consider diagnostic and therapeutic implications of using ICI during this unprecedented period of COVID-19 infections.
32434790,In particular, we consider the impact of ICI on COVID-19 severity, decisions surrounding continuing or interrupting therapy, diagnostic measures in patients with symptoms or manifestations potentially consistent with either COVID-19 or ICI toxicity, and resumption of therapy in infected patients.
32434790,While more robust data are needed to guide clinicians on management of patients with cancer who may be affected by COVID-19, we hope this commentary provides useful insights for the clinical community.
32434798,Infection from the SARS-CoV-2 virus has led to the covid-19 pandemic.
32434798,Given the large number of patients affected, healthcare personnel and facility resources are stretched to the limit; however, the need for urgent and emergent neurosurgical care continues.
32434798,This article describes best practices when performing neurosurgical procedures on patients with covid-19 based on multi-institutional experiences.
32434798,We assembled neurosurgical practitioners from 13 different health systems from across the USA, including those in hot spots, to describe their practices in managing neurosurgical emergencies within the covid-19 environment.
32434798,Patients presenting with neurosurgical emergencies should be considered as persons under investigation (PUI) and thus maximal personal protective equipment (PPE) should be donned during interaction and transfer.
32434798,Intubations and extubations should be done with only anesthesia staff donning maximal PPE in a negative pressure environment.
32434798,Operating room (OR) staff should enter the room once the air has been cleared of particulate matter.
32434798,Certain OR suites should be designated as covid ORs, thus allowing for all neurosurgical cases on covid/PUI patients to be performed in these rooms, which will require a terminal clean post procedure.
32434798,Each covid OR suite should be attached to an anteroom which is a negative pressure room with a HEPA filter, thus allowing for donning and doffing of PPE without risking contamination of clean areas.
32434798,Based on a multi-institutional collaborative effort, we describe best practices when providing neurosurgical treatment for patients with covid-19 in order to optimize clinical care and minimize the exposure of patients and staff.
32434805,The operating room environment is very dynamic with many unique challenges for anesthesia teams caring for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19.
32434805,Specific recommendations by national organizations and institution specific step-by-step guidelines and education materials are required to maintain safety for both patients and caregivers perioperatively, with transport, and medication management.
32435065,COVID-19, a new viral disease affecting primarily the respiratory system and the lung, has caused a pandemic posing serious challenges to healthcare systems around the world.
32435065,In about 20% of patients, severe symptoms occur after a mean incubation period of 5 - 6 days; 5% of patients need intensive care therapy.
32435065,Mortality is about 1 - 2%.
32435065,Protecting healthcare workers is of paramount importance in order to prevent hospital-acquired infections.
32435065,Therefore, during all procedures associated with aerosol production, personal protective equipment consisting of a FFP2/FFP3 (N95) respiratory mask, gloves, safety glasses and a waterproof overall should be used.
32435065,Therapy is based on established recommendations issued for patients with acute lung injury (ARDS).
32435065,Lung protective ventilation, prone position, restrictive fluid management and adequate management of organ failure are the mainstays of therapy.
32435065,In case of fulminant lung failure, veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may be used as a rescue in experienced centres.
32435065,New, experimental therapies are evolving with ever increasing frequency; currently, however, no evidence-based recommendation is possible.
32435065,If off-label and compassionate use of these drugs is considered, an individual benefit-risk assessment is necessary, since serious side effects have been reported.
32435268,Europe is now the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak.
32435268,Many concerns have arisen about the management and treatment of children with cancer while researchers are wondering how to deal with this devastating pandemic.
32435268,In view of the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the COVID-19 outbreak, it is fundamental to stress that the behavior and hygiene rules adopted by children with cancer must be respected and implemented in order to continue to safeguard their health for the current pandemic.
32435272,In December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases was caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China.
32435272,Cancer patients are a special group, the immunity of them will be suppressed because of various anti-tumor treatments, and the risk of infection will be greatly increased, so we will report clinical features of 9 cancer patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. 5 (56%) patients were ordinary type, 3 (33%) were severe type, and 1 (11%) was critical type.
32435272,A total of 8 patients received combined therapy of traditional Chinese medicines and western medicines.
32435272,From the clinical outcomes of these 8 patients, western combined therapy of traditional Chinese medicine was indeed an effective treatment method.
32435272,D-dimmer rise, infection index rise, and chest CT(computed tomography) progression may be clinical warning indicators for severe patients, in our study, more 50% of patients had elevated levels of these indicators, but only 44% (including the dead) of patients had received treatment in the intensive care unit. 5 (56%) ordinary type patients had been discharged, while the 1 (11%) critical type patient died 3 days after admission.
32435272,Cancer comorbidity seems to have no direct relationship with severe events, and the combination of traditional Chinese medicine and western medicine may be effective in the prevention and treatment of novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia (NICP).
32435607,COVID-19 is the current public health threat all over the world.
32435607,Unfortunately, there is no specific prevention and treatment strategy for this disease.
32435607,We aim to explore the potential role of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in this regard through this literature review.
32435607,As a crucial enzyme of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), ACE2 not only mediates the virus entry but also affects the pathophysiological process of virus-induced acute lung injury (ALI), as well as other organs' damage.
32435607,As interaction of COVID-19 virus spike and ACE2 is essential for virus infection, COVID-19-specific vaccine based on spike protein, small molecule compound interrupting their interaction, human monoclonal antibody based on receptor-binding domain, and recombinant human ACE2 protein (rhuACE2) have aroused the interests of researchers.
32435607,Meanwhile, ACE2 could catalyze angiotensin II (Ang II) to form angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7), thus alleviates the harmful effect of Ang II and amplifies the protection effect of Ang1-7.
32435607,ACE inhibitor and angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) have been shown to increase the level of expression of ACE2 and could be potential strategies in protecting lungs, heart, and kidneys.
32435607,ACE2 plays a very important role in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of COVID-19 infection.
32435607,Strategies targeting ACE2 and its ligand, COVID-19 virus spike protein, may provide novel method in the prevention and management of novel coronavirus pneumonia.
32435867,The current pandemic of SARS-CoV‑2 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a particular challenge for diabetes patients.
32435867,Diabetes mellitus predisposes to a particularly severe course of the disease and doubles the COVID-19 mortality risk due to pulmonary and cardiac involvement.
32435867,In addition, diabetes patients often suffer from comorbidities which further worsen clinical outcomes.
32435867,Glycemic control during infectious diseases is often suboptimal, and antidiabetic drugs and insulin therapy have to be adapted accordingly.
32435867,On the other hand, access of diabetes patients to outpatient clinics are limited during the ongoing season urging alternative treatment options, particularly the implementation of novel telemedicine strategies.
32435867,Hence, the opportunity of the COVID 19 crisis should be taken to make a significant step forward in the care for diabetes patients.
32435870,According to the World Health Organization (WHO) the China office was first notified of cases of atypical pneumonia in Wuhan City on 31 December 2019.
32435870,A viral genome sequence of a novel coronavirus, currently termed SARS-CoV‑2, with a disease process called COVID-19 was released 1 week later via online resources to obtain public health support in control of spread.
32435870,Since then, the virus rapidly evolved into a global pandemic.
32435870,Therefore, healthcare providers need to be familiar with the clinical presentation of infected patients and measures to quickly isolate them.
32435870,The prevention of nosocomial spread is paramount to proper control of COVID-19 and is reviewed.
32435870,Currently, treatment is supportive.
32435870,Researchers are working to develop vaccines and identify effective antiviral interventions.
32435870,Those recently discussed in the literature are briefly reviewed.
32435879,There is little information about Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children with underlying chronic renal pathologies.
32435879,From March until April 15, 2020, 16 children with chronic renal pathologies were diagnosed with COVID-19 in Spain.
32435879,Of these, 6 had end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) (3 transplant recipients and 3 on chronic hemodialysis).
32435879,The severity of symptoms was mild in all the patients, with little radiological involvement.
32435879,Three patients were asymptomatic.
32435879,Fever and upper respiratory symptoms were the most frequent findings.
32435879,Basal glomerular filtration worsened in 3 patients; however, recovery was rapidly achieved with rehydration and drug dose adjustment.
32435879,In 2 patients diagnosed with steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome, COVID-19 provoked a disease relapse.
32435879,None required oxygen therapy, and 7 could be managed as outpatients.
32435879,COVID-19 disease appears to have a similar clinical course in children with underlying chronic renal pathologies, even in immunosuppressed cases, as in healthy children of the same age; however, special attention must be paid to fluid management and drug dose adjustment.
32435882,To face SARS-CoV-2 pandemic various attempts are made to identify potential effective treatments by repurposing available drugs.
32435882,Among them, indomethacin, an anti-inflammatory drug, was shown to have potent in-vitro antiviral properties on human SARS-CoV-1, canine CCoV, and more recently on human SARS-CoV-2 at low micromolar range.
32435882,Our objective was to show that indomethacin could be considered as a promising candidate for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 and to provide criteria for comparing benefits of alternative dosage regimens using a model-based approach.
32435882,A multi-stage model-based approach was developed to characterize % of recovery and viral load in CCoV-infected dogs, to estimate the PK of indomethacin in dog and human using published data after administration of immediate (IR) and sustained-release (SR) formulations, and to estimate the expected antiviral activity as a function of different assumptions on the effective exposure in human.
32435882,Different dosage regimens were evaluated for IR formulation (25 mg and 50 mg three-times-a-day, and 25 mg four-times-a-day), and SR formulation (75 mg once and twice-a-day).
32435882,The best performing dosing regimens were: 50 mg three-times-a-day for the IR formulation, and 75 mg twice-a-day for the SR formulation.
32435882,The treatment with the SR formulation at the dose of 75 mg twice-a-day is expected to achieve a complete response in three days for the treatment in patients infected by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.
32435882,These results suggest that indomethacin could be considered as a promising candidate for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 whose potential therapeutic effect need to be further assessed in a prospective clinical trial.
32435920,Since its introduction in modern medicine, naturalistic observations emerged about possible uses of lithium treatment for conditions different from recurring affective disorders, for which it is still a first-line treatment option.
32435920,Some evidence about the antiviral properties of lithium began in the early 1970s, when some reports found a reduction of labial-herpetic recurrences.
32435920,The present review aims to present most of the pre-clinical and clinical evidence about lithium's ability to inhibit DNA and RNA viruses, including Coronaviridae, as well as the possible pathways and mechanisms involved in such antiviral activity.
32435920,Despite a broad number of in vitro studies, the rationale for the antiviral activity of lithium failed to translate into methodologically sound clinical studies demonstrating its antiviral efficacy.
32435920,In addition, the tolerability of lithium as an antiviral agent should be addressed.
32435920,In fact, treatment with lithium requires continuous monitoring of its serum levels in order to prevent acute toxicity and long-term side effects, most notably affecting the kidney and thyroid.
32435920,Yet lithium reaches heterogeneous but bioequivalent concentrations in different tissues, and the anatomical compartment of the viral infection might underpin a different, lower need for tolerability concerns which need to be addressed.
32435920,Lithium presents a clear antiviral activity demonstrated at preclinical level, but that remains to be confirmed in clinical settings.
32435920,In addition, the pleiotropic mechanisms of action of lithium may provide an insight for its possible use as antiviral agent targeting specific pathways.
32435961,COVID-19 is a pandemic which has affected almost every aspect of our life since starting globally in November 2019.
32435961,Given the rapidity of spread and inadequate time to prepare for record numbers of sick patients, our surgical community faces an unforeseen challenge.
32435961,SAGES is committed to the protection and care of patients, their surgeons and staff, and all who are served by the medical community at large.
32435961,This includes physical health, mental health, and well-being of all involved.
32435961,The fear of the unknown ahead can be paralyzing.
32435961,International news media have chronicled the unthinkable situations that physicians and other health care providers have been thrust into as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
32435961,These situations include making life or death decisions for patients and their families regarding use of limited health care resources.
32435961,It includes caring for patients with quickly deteriorating conditions and limited treatments available.
32435961,Until recently, these situations seemed far from home, and now they are in our own hospitals.
32435961,As the pandemic broadened its reach, the reality that we as surgeons may be joining the front line is real.
32435961,It may be happening to you now; it may be on the horizon in the coming weeks.
32435961,In this context, SAGES put together this document addressing concerns on clinician stressors in these times of uncertainty.
32435961,We chose to focus on the emotional toll of the situation on the clinician, protecting vulnerable persons, reckoning with social isolation, and promoting wellness during this crisis.
32435961,At the same time, the last part of this document deals with the &quot;light at the end of the tunnel,&quot; discussing potential opportunities, lessons learned, and the positives that can come out of this crisis.
32436029,COVID-19 is an emerging disease of public health concern.
32436029,While there is no specific recommended treatment for COVID-19, nitric oxide has the potential to be of therapeutic value for managing acute respiratory distress syndrome in patients with COVID-19.
32436029,However, inhaled nitric oxide has not yet been formally evaluated.
32436029,Given the extent of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the large numbers of hospitalized patients requiring respiratory support, clinical use of inhaled nitric oxide may become an alternate rescue therapy before extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for the management of acute respiratory distress syndrome in patients with COVID-19.
32436445,COVID-19 has grown into a global pandemic that has strained healthcare throughout the world.
32436445,There is a sense of urgency in finding a cure for this deadly virus.
32436445,In this study, we reviewed the empiric options used in common practice for COVID-19, based on the literature available online, with an emphasis on human experiences with these treatments on severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-COV-1) and other viruses.
32436445,Convalescent blood products are the most promising potential treatment for use in COVID-19.
32436445,The use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), remdesivir, and tocilizumab are some of the other promising potential therapies; however, they are yet to be tested in randomized clinical trials (RCTs).
32436445,The use of lopinavir-ritonavir did not prove beneficial in a large RCT.
32436445,The use of corticosteroids should be avoided in COVID-19 pneumonia unless used for other indications, based on the suggestion of harm in patients with SARS-COV-1 and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) infection. <i>The reviews of this paper are available via the supplemental material section.</i>
32436581,The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) pandemic is causing an increased need for mechanical ventilation for a significant percentage of people who present to the hospital for treatment.
32436581,This increase in demand could surpass the supply of ventilators and lead to an increase in mortality due to a lack of ventilator vacancies.
32436581,There is significant evidence that osteopathic manipulative medicine (OMM) can alleviate pulmonary symptoms and aid in quicker recoveries from various respiratory ailments.
32436581,OMM has the potential to play a significant role in helping reduce a patient's need for mechanical ventilation by delaying the onset of acute respiratory distress syndrome stemming from SARS-Cov2 infections.
32436994,Current evidence suggests an important role of interleukin-6 (IL-6) pathway in SARS-CoV-2-related cytokine release storm in severely ill COVID-19 patients.
32436994,Inhibition of the IL-6 pathway with tocilizumab has been employed successfully in some of these patients but the data is mostly consistent of case reports and series.
32436994,We performed a systematic search of PubMed, Embase, and Medline from 22<sup>nd</sup> April 2020 and again on 27<sup>th</sup> April 2020 using the following search terms alone or in combination: &quot;COVID-19&quot;, &quot;coronavirus&quot;, &quot;SARS-CoV-2&quot;, &quot;COVID&quot;, &quot;anti-interleukin 6 receptor antibodies&quot;, &quot;anti-IL-6&quot;, &quot;tocilizumab&quot;, &quot;sarilumab&quot;, &quot;siltuximab&quot;.
32436994,We included studies which reported individual patient data.
32436994,We extracted and analyzed individual level data on baseline characteristics, laboratory findings, and clinical outcomes.
32436994,Primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality.
32436994,Secondary endpoints included in-hospital complications, recovery rates, effect of patient characteristics on the primary outcome and changes in levels of inflammatory markers. 352 records were identified through the systematic search of which 10 studies met the inclusion criteria.
32436994,A single study currently under review was also added.
32436994,Eleven observational studies encompassing 29 patients were included in the present review.
32436994,There were more males (24 [82.8%]) and hypertension was the most common comorbidity (16 [48.3 %]).
32436994,Over an average of 5.4 hospital days, the primary endpoint occurred in 6 (20.7%) patients.
32436994,Among surviving patients, about 10% had worsened disease and 17% recovered.
32436994,The most common complication was acute respiratory distress syndrome (8[27.6%]).
32436994,IL-6 level was significantly higher after the initiation of tocilizumab with median (IQR) of 376.6 (148-900.6) pg/mL compared to the baseline of 71.1 (31.9-122.8) pg/mL (p=0.002).
32436994,Mean (SD) levels of c-reactive protein (CRP) were significantly decreased following treatment 24.6 (26.9) mg/L compared to baseline 140.4 (77) mg/L (P&lt; 0.0001).
32436994,Baseline demographics were not significantly different amongst survivors and non-survivors by Fisher's exact test.
32436994,In COVID-19 patients treated with tocilizumab, IL-6 levels are significantly elevated which are supportive of cytokine storm.
32436994,Following initiation of tocilizumab, there is elevation in the IL-6 levels and CRP levels dramatically decrease suggesting an improvement in this hyper-inflammatory state.
32436994,Ongoing randomized control trials will allow for further evaluation of this promising therapy.
32436994,Recent data indicate that severe COVID 19 causes cytokine release storm and is associated with worse clinical outcomes and IL-6 plays an important role.
32436994,It is suggestive that anti-IL6 results in the improvement of this hyperinflammatory state.
32436994,However, to our knowledge, there is no individual patient data systematic review performed to summarize baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes of COVID 19 patients who received tocilizumab.

32437004,COVID-19 is highly contagious and has a variety of clinical manifestations, it can affect a number of other organs in addition to the lungs, and liver injury may occur.
32437004,SARS-CoV-2 can cause liver injury through systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), cytokine storms, ischemia-reperfusion injury, side effects of treatment drugs, and underlying liver disease and can attack liver cells directly via ACE2.
32437004,Clinical studies have found that liver injury in COVID-19 patients mainly manifests as abnormal liver biochemical indicators, but there have been no reports of liver failure caused by this disease.
32437004,The number of COVID-19 patients with liver injury is increasing, and the incidence of liver injury in COVID-19 patients with severe disease are higher than in patients with mild disease.
32437004,Liver injury may be a risk factor for progresses and worsens in patients with COVID-19, and it is necessary to pay attention to the occurrence of liver injury in the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.

32437014,Currently, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic disease with significant morbidity and mortality.
32437014,Ozone may exert its antiviral actions and ozone therapy has been demonstrated therapeutically usefulness in influenza and novel viruses.
32437014,In this letter, two severe cases with COVID-19 received ozone therapy were described.
32437014,The results showed that ozone therapy may promote recovery of clinical condition and improvement of chest CT images, shorten the duration of viral shedding and length of hospital stay.

32437017,Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first reported in Wuhan, a series of confirmed cases of COVID-19 were found on the Qinghai-Tibet plateau.
32437017,We aimed to describe the epidemiological, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of all confirmed cases in Qinghai, a province at high altitude.
32437017,The region had no sustained local transmission.
32437017,Of all 18 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, 15 patients comprising 4 transmission clusters were identified.
32437017,Three patients were infected by direct contact without travel history to Wuhan.
32437017,Of 18 patients, 10 patients showed bilateral pneumonia and 2 patients showed no abnormalities.
32437017,Three patients with comorbidities such as hypertension, liver diseases or diabetes developed severe illness.
32437017,High C-reactive protein levels and elevations of both ALT and AST were observed in 3 severely ill patients on admission.
32437017,All 18 patients were eventually discharged, including the 3 severe patients who recovered after treatment with non-invasive mechanical ventilation, convalescent plasma and other therapies.
32437017,Our findings confirmed human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in clusters.
32437017,Patients with comorbidities are more likely to develop severe illness.

32437032,As COVID-19 continues to challenge the practice of head and neck oncology, clinicians are forced to make new decisions in the setting of the pandemic that impact the safety of their patients, their institutions, and themselves.
32437032,The difficulty inherent in these decisions is compounded by potentially serious ramifications to the welfare of patients and health-care staff, amid a scarcity of data on which to base informed choices.
32437032,This paper explores the risks of COVID-19 incurred while striving to uphold the standard of care in head and neck oncology.
32437032,The ethical problems are assessed from the perspective of the patient with cancer, health-care provider, and other patients within the health-care system.
32437032,While no single management algorithm for head and neck cancer can be universally implemented, a detailed examination of these issues is necessary to formulate ethically sound treatment strategies.
32437052,The new coronavirus (COVID-19) infection reported by China in December 2019 has become a pandemic affecting the entire world in a few weeks.
32437052,In this respect, it is crucial to determine case increase and case fatality and case recovery rates in order to control COVID-19.
32437052,In this study, case increase, case fatality and case recovery rates of COVID-19 in 36 European countries were analyzed with meta-analysis method using data released by the health organizations and WHO.
32437052,The data were obtained from the website of health organizations of 36 European countries and the website of WHO until the date of May 11, 2020.
32437052,The analyses were carried out on 1,744,704 COVID-19 diagnosed cases in 36 European countries.
32437052,The case increase and case fatality and case recovery rates of COVID-19 were calculated using 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), single-arm meta-analysis, cross-temporal meta-analysis and meta-regression random effects model.
32437052,The standardized case increase rate of COVID-19 is 5% (95% CI [0.040, 0.063]) and the average case increase rate in European countries has started to decline by around 3% (95% CI [0.047, 0.083]) weekly.
32437052,The countries with the highest rate of case increase are Belgium, Sweden, Russia, the Netherlands and the UK.
32437052,Although the case fatality rate of COVID-19 patients was 4.5% as of May 11 (95% CI [0.037-0.055]), this rate is 6.3% (95% CI [0.047, 0.083]) in standardized time (6<sup>th</sup> week).
32437052,Case recovery rates of patients are 46% (95% CI [0.376-0.547]).
32437052,This research presents important results regarding the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe.
32437052,Although the rate of increase in new COVID-19 cases has dropped, there is not much decline in case fatality rates and no increase in case recovery rates.
32437052,The case fatality rate of COVID-19 in Europe was estimated to be in the range of 4-4.5% and minimum 4 weeks (As of May 11) are expected in order to have the figure below 1% in the country with an average case increase rate.
32437052,Monitoring case fatality in Belgium, the Netherlands and Sweden, and treatment successes in Germany and Austria play an utmost importance.

32437381,The COVID-19 pandemic has already changed our globalised world and its long-term impact is not yet known.
32437381,It is apparent that businesses and institutions are increasingly affected.
32437381,COVID-19 discussions often focus on intensive care units in hospitals.
32437381,However, COVID-19 also effects life-saving and -prolonging radiotherapy for patients suffering from cancer.
32437381,We have conducted a structured online survey among medical physicists in Germany, Austria and Switzerland from March 23rd to 26th 2020.
32437381,In total 154 responses (82 completed, 72 partially completed) were analysed in the context of the COVID-19 dissemination.
32437381,72.4% of the respondent's state that their processes are affected due to COVID-19, while the top three answers are longer processing times (54.2%), patient no-shows (42.5%) and staff reduction (36.7%).
32437381,75.8% expect further unavailability of their personnel in the upcoming weeks.
32437381,All participants have already taken several measures, especially providing information for patients at the entrance (89.6%) or over the phone (73.6%), restricting access for accompanying persons (77.4%) and providing disinfectant at the entrance (72.6%).
32437381,The results presented in this article aim to support business continuity and risk management for radiotherapy centres to prepare for future challenges.
32437381,The results show that most radiotherapy centres has implemented initial contingency measures, applying them pragmatically.
32437381,The main problem however remains, that is the high risk of infection both for patients and medical personnel along with the associated risk of temporarily loss of personnel and ordered closure of business.
32437675,A patient underwent surgery for acute type A aortic dissection.
32437675,SARS- CoV-2 was positive.
32437675,The postoperative course was complicated by a mixed viral/bacterial pneumonia with bilateral infiltration, treated with antibiotics and hydroxychloroquine, without any need for reintubation.
32437675,The patient recovered and finally could be dismissed.
32437675,This report shows feasibility for surgical treatment of acute aortic disease in patients with COVID-19.
32437696,In December 2019, a novel coronavirus-associated pneumonia (COVID-19) was first detected in Wuhan, China.
32437696,To prevent the rapid spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and treat patients with mild symptoms, sports stadiums and convention centers were reconstructed into mobile hospitals.
32437696,Whether a mobile cabin hospital can provide a safe treatment site for patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms remains unknown.
32437696,We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 421 patients with COVID-19 admitted to a mobile cabin hospital in Wuhan from February 9th to March 5th, 2020.
32437696,Clinical data comprised patient age, sex, clinical presentation, chest imaging, nucleic acid testing, length of hospitalization, and outcomes.
32437696,The outcome was recovery and hospital discharge in 86% of patients, while 14.0% developed severe symptoms and were transferred to a designated hospital.
32437696,The most common presenting symptoms were fever (60.6%) and cough (52.0%), while 5.2% showed no obvious symptoms.
32437696,High fever (&gt;39.0°C) was more common in severe cases than recovered cases (18.6% versus 6.6%).
32437696,The distribution of lung lesions was peripheral in 85.0% of patients, multifocal in 69.4%, and bilateral in 68.2%.
32437696,The most common pattern was ground-glass opacity (67.7%), followed by patchy shadowing (49.2%).
32437696,The incidence of patchy shadowing was higher in severe patients (66.1%) than in those who recovered (31.8%, P&lt;.0001).
32437696,The median length of hospitalization was 17 (14-19) days, and the median time taken for positive real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction results to become negative in recovered patients was 8 (6-10) days.
32437696,Mobile cabin hospitals provide a safe treatment site for patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms, and provide an effective isolation area to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
32437739,Cytokine release syndrome plays a crucial pathogenic role in COVID-19 pneumonia.
32437739,This pilot study provides the first evidence of the safety of anti-IL-1 treatment with highdose IV anakinra in 5 patients, who experienced a positive outcome.
32437770,SARS-CoV-2-pneumonia emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019.
32437770,Unfortunately, there is lack of evidence about the optimal management of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), even less in patients on maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) therapy than in the general population.
32437770,In this retrospective observational single-center study we analyzed the clinical course and outcomes of all MHD patients hospitalized with COVID-19 from March 12<sup>th</sup> to April 10<sup>th</sup>, 2020 as confirmed by real time polymerase chain reaction.
32437770,Baseline features, clinical course, laboratory data, and different therapies were compared between survivors and non-survivors to identify risk factors associated with mortality.
32437770,Among the 36 patients, 11 (30.5%) died and 7 could be discharged within the observation period.
32437770,Clinical and radiological evolution during the first week of admission were predictive of mortality.
32437770,Among the 36 patients, 18 had worsening of their clinical status, as defined by severe hypoxia with oxygen therapy requirements greater than 4 Liters/minute and radiological worsening.
32437770,Significantly 11 out of those 18 patients (61.1%) died.
32437770,None of the classical cardiovascular risk factors in the general population were associated with higher mortality.
32437770,However, a longer time on hemodialysis (hazard ratio 1.008(95% confidence interval 1.001-1.015) per year), increased LDH levels (1.006(1.001-1.011), and lower lymphocyte count (0.996 (0.992-1.000) one week after clinical onset were all significantly associated with higher mortality risk.
32437770,Thus, the mortality among hospitalized hemodialysis patients diagnosed with COVID-19 is high.
32437770,Lymphopenia and increased LDH levels were associated with poor prognosis.
32437797,The ongoing wreaking global outbreak of the novel human beta coronavirus (CoV) pathogen was presumed to be from a seafood wholesale market in Wuhan, China, belongs to the Coronaviridae family in the Nidovirales order.
32437797,The virus is highly contagious with potential human-human transmission which was named as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread across six continents and emerged as a global pandemic in short span with alarming levels of spread and severity.
32437797,This virus associated symptoms and infectious respiratory illness is designated as coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19).
32437797,The SARS-CoV-2 possesses enveloped club-like spike protein projections with positive-sense large RNA genome and has a unique replication strategy.
32437797,This virus was believed to have zoonotic origin with genetical identity to bat and pangolin CoV.
32437797,In the current review, we introduce a general overview about the human CoVs and the associated diseases, the origin, structure, replication and key clinical events that occur in the COVID-19 pathogenicity.
32437797,Furthermore, we focused on possible therapeutic options such as repurposing drugs including antimalarials, antivirals, antiparasitic drugs, and anti-HIV drugs, as well as monoclonal antibodies, vaccines as potential treatment options.
32437797,Also we have summarized the latest research progress on the usage of stem cell therapy, human convalescent serum, interferon's, in the treatment of COVID-19.
32437820,The new coronavirus COVID-19 disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 was declared a global public health emergency by WHO on Jan 30, 2020.
32437820,Despite massive efforts from various governmental, health and medical organizations, the disease continues to spread globally with increasing fatality rates.
32437820,Several experimental drugs have been approved by FDA with unknown efficacy and potential adverse effects.
32437820,The exponentially spreading pandemic of COVID-19 deserves prime public health attention to evaluate yet unexplored arenas of management.
32437820,We opine that one of these treatment options is low dose radiation therapy for severe and most critical cases.
32437820,There is evidence in literature that low dose radiation induces an anti-inflammatory phenotype that can potentially afford therapeutic benefit against COVID-19-related complications that are associated with significant morbidity and mortality.
32437820,Herein, we review the effects and putative mechanisms of low dose radiation that may be viable, useful and of value in counter-acting the acute inflammatory state induced by critical stage COVID-19.
32437877,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can cause severe respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation.
32437877,The abnormalities observed on chest computed tomography (CT) and the clinical presentation of COVID-19 patients are not always like those of typical acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and can change over time.
32437877,This manuscript aimed to provide brief guidance for respiratory management of COVID-19 patients before, during, and after mechanical ventilation, based on the recent literature and on our direct experience with this population.
32437877,We identify that chest CT patterns in COVID-19 may be divided into three main phenotypes: 1) multiple, focal, possibly overperfused ground-glass opacities; 2) inhomogeneously distributed atelectasis; and 3) a patchy, ARDS-like pattern.
32437877,Each phenotype can benefit from different treatments and ventilator settings.
32437877,Also, peripheral macro- and microemboli are common, and attention should be paid to the risk of pulmonary embolism.
32437877,We suggest use of personalized mechanical ventilation strategies based on respiratory mechanics and chest CT patterns.
32437877,Further research is warranted to confirm our hypothesis.
32437934,Coronavirus Disease 19 is a global healthcare emergency with high lethality rate.
32437934,Relevant inflammatory cytokine storm is associated with severity of disease and IL1 inhibition is a cornerstone treatment for hyperinflammatory diseases.
32437934,We present here the case of a patient with critical COVID-19 successfully treated with IL-1 receptor antagonist (anakinra).
32437942,COVID-19 mortality disproportionally affects nursing homes, creating enormous pressures to deliver high-quality end-of-life care.
32437942,Comprehensive palliative care should be an explicit part of both national and global COVID-19 response plans.
32437942,Therefore, we aimed to identify, review and compare national and international COVID-19 guidance for nursing homes concerning palliative care, issued by government bodies and professional associations.
32437942,We performed a directed documentary and content analysis of newly developed or adapted COVID-19 guidance documents from across the world.
32437942,Documents were collected via expert consultation and independently screened against pre-specified eligibility criteria.
32437942,We applied thematic analysis and narrative synthesis techniques.
32437942,We identified 21 eligible documents covering both nursing homes and palliative care; from the World Health Organization (n=3), and eight individual countries: USA (n=7), the Netherlands (n=2), Ireland (n=1), United Kingdom (n=3), Switzerland (n=3), New Zealand (n=1), Belgium (n=1).
32437942,International documents focused primarily on infection prevention and control, including only a few sentences on palliative care related topics.
32437942,Palliative care themes most frequently mentioned across documents were end-of-life visits, advance care planning documentation, and clinical decision-making towards the end of life (focusing on hospital transfers).
32437942,There is a dearth of comprehensive international COVID-19 guidance on palliative care for nursing homes.
32437942,Most have a limited focus both regarding breadth of topics and recommendations made.
32437942,Key aspects of palliative care, i.e. symptom management, staff education and support, referral to specialist services or hospice, and family support, need greater attention in future guidelines.
32437946,As coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to impact the seriously ill and their families on a global scale, considerations given to marginalized groups amid the pandemic are essential to ensure the provision of high-quality and dignified care.
32437946,Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, gender-nonconforming, and queer/questioning-identified (LGBTQ+) persons are particularly vulnerable to health inequities across settings, including palliative care and at the end of life.
32437946,There is a crucial gap in the literature pertaining to palliative care for LGBTQ+ populations during COVID-19.
32437946,We aim to fill this gap by providing essential health inequity and social support background pertaining to LGBTQ+ persons and practical recommendations for immediate implementation that support inclusive and respectful care for these populations.
32437946,Using these recommendations is a pragmatic pathway to promote trust, transparency, patient and family engagement, and value concordant care amid the health system strain caused by COVID-19.
32438018,Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are now being widely used as treatments for COVID-19.
32438018,Both medications prolong the QT interval and accordingly may put patients at increased risk of torsades de pointes and sudden death.
32438018,Published guidance documents vary in their recommendations for monitoring and managing these potential adverse effects.
32438018,Accordingly, we set out to conduct a systematic review of the arrhythmogenic effect of short courses of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine.
32438018,We searched in MEDLINE and Embase, as well as grey literature up to April 17, 2020, on the risk of QT prolongation, torsades, ventricular arrhythmia, and sudden death with short-term chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine usage.
32438018,This resulted in 390 unique records, of which fourteen were ultimately selected for qualitative synthesis and which included data on 1515 COVID-19 patients.
32438018,Approximately 10% of COVID-19 patients treated with these drugs developed QT prolongation.
32438018,We found evidence of ventricular arrhythmia in two COVID-19 patients out of a group of 28 treated with high-dose chloroquine.
32438018,A limitation of these results is unclear follow-up and possible publication/reporting bias, but there is compelling evidence that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine induce significant QT interval prolongation and potentially increase the risk of arrhythmia.
32438018,Daily ECG monitoring and other risk mitigation strategies should be considered in order to prevent possible harms from what is currently an unproven therapy.
32438240,The recent global pandemic created by the Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, started in Wuhan, China in December 2019, has generated panic, both in term of human death (4-5% of infected patients identified through testing) and the global economy.
32438240,Human sufferings seem to be continuing, and it is not clear how long this will continue and how much more destruction it is going to cause until complete control is achieved.
32438240,One of the most disturbing issues is Covid-19 treatment; although a large number of medications, previously used successfully with other viruses (including Chinese herbal medicines and anti-malaria drugs), are under consideration, there remain questions as to whether they can play a satisfactory role for this disease.
32438240,Global attempts are ongoing to find the drugs for the treatment of this virus but none of the antiviral drugs used for treatment of other human viral infection is working and hence attempts to find new drugs are continuing.
32438240,Here the author is proposing that 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) which when used on its own is failing as an antiviral agent due to the removal of this compound by proof reading ability exceptionally found in Coronaviruses.
32438240,The author here is proposing to test 5-FU in combination with a number of deoxynucleosides on animal models infected with this Covid-19.
32438240,Should encouraging results ensue, therapies could then be tried on patients.
32438256,Since the outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), epidemic prevention strategies have been implemented worldwide.
32438256,For the sake of controlling the infectious coronavirus pneumonia, early diagnosis and quarantine play an imperative role.
32438256,Currently, the mainstream diagnostic methods are imaging and laboratory diagnosis, which differ in their efficacy of diagnosis.
32438256,To compare the detection rate, we reviewed numerous literature on pneumonia caused by coronaviruses (SARS, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2) and analyzed two different ways of diagnosis.
32438256,The results showed that the detection rate of computed tomography (CT) diagnosis was significantly higher than that of real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) (P = 0.00697).
32438256,Still, clinicians should combine radiology and laboratory methods to achieve a higher detection rate, so that instant isolation and treatment could be effectively conducted to curb the rampant spread of the epidemic.
32438328,COVID-19 is an emerging pandemic due to droplet infection of 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
32438328,Due to its rapid transmission and high case-fatality rate, recognition of its risk and prognostic factor is important.
32438328,Obesity has been associated with impaired immune system, increasing the susceptibility for 2019-nCoV infection.
32438328,We aimed to study the impact of obesity to the prognosis and disease severity of COVID-19.
32438328,A systematic search and handsearching was conducted in four databases: Cochrane, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PubMed.
32438328,The identified articles were screened using the chosen eligibility criteria.
32438328,We obtained three retrospective cohort studies (Wu J et al., Lighter J et al., and Simonnet A et al.) to be critically appraised using Newcastle Ottawa Scale.
32438328,The findings of all included studies were consistent in stating the contribution of obesity as a risk factor to increase the requirement for advanced medical care.
32438328,Study with the highest quality, Simonnet A et al., reported an increase need of invasive mechanical ventilation in COVID-19 patients with body mass index higher than 35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, OR: 7.36 (1.63-33.14; p = 0.021).
32438328,This is associated with a higher mortality rate in obese population infected with COVID-19.
32438328,Obesity is an independent risk and prognostic factor for the disease severity and the requirement of advanced medical care in COVID-19.
32438328,This systematic review highlights a particularly vulnerable group - obese, and emphasises on the importance of treatment aggression and disease prevention in this population group.
32438329,During COVID-19 pandemic, researchers are using innovative technologies for fast-tracking the development to end this menace.
32438329,Virtual Reality (VR) also offers an imperative role for fighting this pandemic, through audiovisual-based virtual communication.
32438329,A brief study on Virtual Reality and its applications for the COVID-19 pandemic is carried out by employing keywords as Virtual reality or VR and COVID-19 from the databases of SCOPUS, Google Scholar, PubMed, Web of science Academia and ResearchGate.
32438329,VR is beneficial for remote sites for exploring telemedicine, planning, treatment, and controlling of the infections by providing proper awareness to the people regarding this disease.
32438329,VR technology develops a platform to reduce the face to face interaction of doctors with the infected COVID-19 patients.
32438329,Through live video streaming, it helps to improve surveillance systems on the ongoing situation.
32438330,As on date, no specific treatment is available for devastating COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.
32438330,This pandemic viral infection has affected over 200 countries within a very short time and created a calamitous situation across the globe.
32438330,As per WHO guidelines, the treatment is mainly symptomatic and supportive.
32438330,This clinical protocol has not proven sufficient to save the lives of COVID-19 patients suffering from diabetes or having underlying liver diseases; hence there is utmost need to tackle this situation by other means such as Convalescent Plasma (CP) therapy.
32438330,A comprehensive literature survey was carriedout using Elsevier, PubMed, Taylor &amp; Francis, Springer, Nature and Google search engines.
32438330,The patients suffering from diabetes or liver dysfunction or any other underlying diseases are at greatest risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32438330,From the study, it is proved that plasma collected from the recovered patients of viral infection has considerable potential to treat the viral disease without the occurrence of adverse effects.
32438330,The CP therapy can be a possible life saving alternative to treat critical COVID-19 patients having diabetes or underlying liver dysfunction.
32438330,Hence, randomised clinical trials are recommended at the earliest to save the lives of infected individuals of COVID-19.
32438333,The objective of this study was to evaluate the pooled estimate of diabetes prevalence in young (&lt;50 years) versus elderly (&gt;50 years) COVID-19 cohorts.
32438333,Studies published between December-2019 and March-2020 reporting demographic and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 cases were identified.
32438333,A total of 11 studies included accounting for 2084 COVID-19 patients.
32438333,The overall prevalence of diabetes in COVID-19 patients with a mean age&gt;50 years was 13.2%, whereas studies with relatively younger patients (mean age &lt;50 years) had a pooled prevalence of 9.0% CONCLUSION: The overall prevalence of diabetes in COVID-19 patients was found to be 13.2% with studies including relatively elderly patients showing higher rates of diabetes.
32438333,The intermingled effects of diabetes with other cardiovascular comorbidities warrant age-specific outcomes data including the impact of ongoing antidiabetic treatment.
32438340,This manuscript provides guidance on the management of thyroid dysfunction during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32438340,Auto-immune thyroid diseases are not linked to increased risks of COVID-19.
32438340,Uncontrolled thyrotoxicosis may result in more severe complications from SARS-CoV-2 infection, including thyroid storm.
32438340,The management of patients with a new diagnosis of hyperthyroidism is best undertaken with a block and replace regimen due to limited biochemical testing availability.
32438340,Antithyroid drug (ATD)-induced neutropenia may favour the progression of COVID-19 and symptoms of infection may be confused with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32438340,The withdrawal of ATDs and urgent measurement of neutrophils should be considered in case of flu-like manifestations occurring in the initial months of treatment.
32438340,Urgent surgery or 131-I may be undertaken in selected cases of uncontrolled thyrotoxicosis.
32438340,Patients with COVID-19 infection may present with conjunctivitis, which could cause diagnostic difficulties in patients with new or existing Graves' ophthalmopathy.
32438340,Patients who are on replacement treatment with thyroid hormones should ensure they have sufficient supply of medication.
32438340,The usual advice to increase dosage of levothyroxine during pregnancy should be adhered to.
32438340,Many newly presenting and previously diagnosed patients with thyroid dysfunction can be managed through virtual telephone or video clinics supported by a dedicated nurse-led service, depending on available facilities.
32438345,Most patients with thyroid nodules and thyroid cancer (TC) referred for diagnostic work-up and treatment are not considered at higher risk of infection from SARS-CoV-2 compared to the general population.
32438345,On the other hand, healthcare resources should be spared to the maximum extent possible during a pandemic.
32438345,Indeed, while thyroid nodules are very common, only a small percentage are cancerous and, in turn, most thyroid cancers are indolent in nature.
32438345,Accordingly, diagnostic work-up of thyroid nodules, thyroid surgery for either benign or malignant thyroid nodules and radioiodine treatment for differentiated thyroid cancers may be safely postponed during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
32438345,Appropriate patient counselling, however, is mandatory and red flags should be carefully identified prompting immediate evaluation and treatment as appropriate.
32438345,For these selected cases diagnostic work-up (e.g. ultrasound, scintigraphy, fine-needle aspiration), surgery and radioiodine therapy may proceed despite the threat of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19, after an individual risk-benefit analysis.
32438371,The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 uses an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) for the replication of its genome and the transcription of its genes<sup>1-3</sup>.
32438371,Here we present the cryo-electron microscopic structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp in active form, mimicking the replicating enzyme.
32438371,The structure comprises the viral proteins nsp12, nsp8, and nsp7, and over two turns of RNA template-product duplex.
32438371,The active site cleft of nsp12 binds the first turn of RNA and mediates RdRp activity with conserved residues.
32438371,Two copies of nsp8 bind to opposite sides of the cleft and position the second turn of RNA.
32438371,Long helical extensions in nsp8 protrude along exiting RNA, forming positively charged 'sliding poles'.
32438371,These sliding poles can account for the known processivity of the RdRp that is required for replicating the long coronavirus genome<sup>3</sup>.
32438371,Our results enable a detailed analysis of the inhibitory mechanisms that underlie the antiviral activity of substances such as remdesivir, a drug for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)<sup>4</sup>.
32438382,The COVID-19 pandemic requires us to rethink how virtual approaches might work for people who use alcohol and other drugs.
32438382,Are virtual clinics only suitable for clients with whom clinicians have already formed a therapeutic relationship?
32438382,How well would virtual clinics work for new clients presenting to services, for clients in acute distress, and for those with complex problems?
32438382,Addressing the sustained change required to maintain substance-free lives or a safe substance-use life requires robust psychotherapeutic approaches, which have traditionally been delivered through physical contact, whether they are one-to-one or group-based interventions.
32438382,The challenge during this time of the COVID-19 pandemic is to deliver effective talking therapies while avoiding physical contact.
32438382,How then should services continue to offer counselling and support in such an environment?
32438382,How can we learn from the COVID-19 situation to deliver treatment to individuals who may have difficulties attending traditional clinic-based care, such as those in more rural areas with transport difficulties?
32438382,This article focuses on identifying practical issues and providing some solutions.
32438383,COVID-19 is a new zoonotic disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
32438383,Since its emergence in Wuhan City, China, the virus has rapidly spread across the globe causing calamitous health, economic and societal consequences.
32438383,It causes disproportionately severe disease in the elderly and those with co-morbidities, such as hypertension and diabetes.
32438383,There is currently no proven treatment for COVID-19 and a safe and effective vaccine is at least a year away.
32438383,The virus gains access to the respiratory epithelium through cell surface angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
32438383,The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the virus is unlikely to mutate without loss of pathogenicity and thus represents an attractive target for antiviral treatment.
32438383,Inhaled modified recombinant human ACE2, may bind SARS-CoV-2 and mitigate lung damage.
32438383,This decoy strategy is unlikely to provoke an adverse immune response and may reduce morbidity and mortality in high-risk groups.
32438446,There is a rapidly expanding literature on the in vitro antiviral activity of drugs that may be repurposed for therapy or chemoprophylaxis against SARS-CoV-2.
32438446,However, this has not been accompanied by a comprehensive evaluation of the target plasma and lung concentrations of these drugs following approved dosing in humans.
32438446,Accordingly, EC<sub>90</sub> values recalculated from in vitro anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity data was expressed as a ratio to the achievable maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) at an approved dose in humans (Cmax/EC<sub>90</sub> ratio).
32438446,Only 14 of the 56 analysed drugs achieved a Cmax/EC<sub>90</sub> ratio above 1.
32438446,A more in-depth assessment demonstrated that only nitazoxanide, nelfinavir, tipranavir (ritonavir-boosted) and sulfadoxine achieved plasma concentrations above their reported anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity across their entire approved dosing interval.
32438446,An unbound lung to plasma tissue partition coefficient (K<sub>p</sub> U<sub>lung</sub> ) was also simulated to derive a lung Cmax/EC<sub>50</sub> as a better indicator of potential human efficacy.
32438446,Hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, mefloquine, atazanavir (ritonavir-boosted), tipranavir (ritonavir-boosted), ivermectin, azithromycin and lopinavir (ritonavir-boosted) were all predicted to achieve lung concentrations over 10-fold higher than their reported EC<sub>50</sub> .
32438446,Nitazoxanide and sulfadoxine also exceeded their reported EC<sub>50</sub> by 7.8- and 1.5-fold in lung, respectively.
32438446,This analysis may be used to select potential candidates for further clinical testing, while deprioritising compounds unlikely to attain target concentrations for antiviral activity.
32438446,Future studies should focus on EC<sub>90</sub> values and discuss findings in the context of achievable exposures in humans, especially within target compartments such as the lung, in order to maximise the potential for success of proposed human clinical trials.
32438454,The pandemic spread of the new COVID-19 coronavirus infection in China first, and all over the world at present, has become a global health emergency due to the rapidly increasing number of affected patients.
32438454,Currently, a clear relationship between COVID-19 infection incidence and/or complications due to chronic or occasional treatments for other pathologies is still not clear, albeit COVID-19 pandemic may condition the treatment strategy of complex disorders, as osteoarthritis (OA).
32438454,Importantly, OA is the most common age-related joint disease affecting more than 80% of people older than the age of 55, an age burden also shared with the highest severity in COVID-19 patients.
32438454,OA patients often show a large array of concomitant pathologies such as diabetes, inflammation and cardiovascular diseases that are again shared with COVID-19 patients and may therefore increase complications.
32438454,Moreover, different OA treatments such as NSAIDs, paracetamol, corticosteroids, opioids or other molecules have a wide array of iatrogenic effects, potentially increasing COVID-19 secondary infection incidence or complications.
32438454,In this review we critically analyse the evidences on either negative or positive effect of drugs commonly used to manage OA in this particular scenario.
32438454,This would provide orthopaedic surgeons at first, and physicians, pharmacologists and clinicians at general, a comprehensive description about the safety of the current pharmacological approaches and a decision making tool to treat their OA patients as the coronavirus pandemic continues.
32438459,The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic poses a serious threat to public health and local economies around the globe.
32438459,This has created an urgent need to identify effective medications for its prevention and treatment (1).
32438459,Among these treatments, the off-label use of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), a less toxic derivate of chloroquine, has become a common practice among clinicians, including pediatricians, despite lack of evidence of its clinical efficacy for this indication (especially for pediatric patients) at present time (2).
32438464,During the COVID-19 pandemic, transplant recipients have been recognized as more susceptible to infection, to have greater severity of disease, and prolonged shedding of this highly transmissible virus.<sup>1</sup> However, there is limited information on the impact of COVID-19 in liver transplant (LT) recipients.
32438464,We reviewed three reported cases with detailed treatment information from China to better understand the features and associated therapeutic strategies used in transplant recipients with COVID-19.<sup>2-4</sup>.
32438617,COVID-19 often leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome complicated by acute kidney injury (AKI).
32438617,The indications for renal replacement therapy for these patients are those commonly accepted to treat AKI.
32438617,We describe a continuous veno-venous haemodialysis (CVVHD) protocol for AKI, which aims to provide the best treatment according to the particular patient's and medical personnels' needs in biohazard settings with limited human and technological resources.
32438617,We designed a CVVHD protocol with a high cut-off (HCO) filter in regional citrate anticoagulation (RCA).
32438617,The HCO filter in diffusion determines the enhanced cytokines clearance with less filter clotting due to a lower filtration fraction.
32438617,In our hospital, at the beginning of the pandemic outbreak, we treated seven COVID-19 patients with AKI stage 2 and 3 and recorded the circuit lifespan and the number of interventions on monitors.
32438617,CVVHD in RCA appears to be safe, effective and easy to be performed in a biohazard scenario using lower blood flows and less bag changes with fluid savings, a biohazard reduction and sparing of resources.
32438617,Although the data come from a very small cohort, our protocol seems related to a low mortality.
32438622,The novel Coronavirus 2 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-Cov-2) has led to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which has surprised health authorities around the world, quickly producing a global health crisis.
32438622,Different actions to cope with this situation are being developed, including confinement, different treatments to improve symptoms, and the creation of the first vaccines.
32438622,In epidemiology, herd immunity is presented as an area that could also solve this new global threat.
32438622,In this review, we present the basis of herd immunology, the dynamics of infection transmission that induces specific immunity, and how the application of immunoepidemiology and herd immunology could be used to control the actual COVID-19 pandemic, along with a discussion of its effectiveness, limitations, and applications.
32438703,The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic is unprecedented as it reached all countries in the world within a record short period of time.
32438703,Even though COVID-19 infection may be just severe in any adults, older adults (65-year-old or older) may experience a higher mortality rate.
32438703,Among those affected, cancer patients may have a worse outcome compared to the general population because of their depressed immune status.
32438703,As the health resources of most countries are limited, clinicians may face painful decisions about which patients to save if they require artificial ventilation.
32438703,Cancer patients, especially the older ones, may be denied supportive care because of their shorter life expectancy.
32438703,Thus, special considerations should be taken to prevent infection of older cancer patients and to provide them with adequate social support during their cancer treatment.
32438703,The following proposal was reached: (1) Education of health care providers about the special needs of older cancer patients and their risks of infection.
32438703,(2) Special consideration such as surgical masks and separate scheduling should be made to protect them from being infected.
32438703,(3) Social services such as patient navigators should be provided to ensure adequate medical supply, food, and daily transportation to cancer centers.
32438703,(4) Close monitoring through phone calls, telecommunication to ensure social distancing and psychological support from patient family to prevent anxiety and depression.
32438703,(5) Shorter course of radiotherapy by use of hypofractionation where possible to decrease the needs for daily transportation and exposure to infection.
32438703,(6) Enrollment of older cancer patients in clinical trials for potential antiviral medications if infection does occur.
32438703,(7) Home health care telemedicine may be an effective strategy for older cancer patients with COVID-19 infection to avoid hospital admission when health care resources become restricted.
32438703,(8) For selected patients, immunotherapy and targeted therapy may become the systemic therapy of choice for older cancer patients and need to be tested in clinical trials.
32438763,Anemia is a frequent manifestation in patients with chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and requires tight monitoring and adequate supplementary therapy.
32438763,Intravenous iron is the first-line treatment in subjects with moderate-severe anemia, active disease, or oral iron intolerance.
32438763,On the other hand, oral iron is recommended in patients with mild anemia and inactive disease.
32438763,However, during the current coronavirus pandemic, hospital activities have significantly changed, and all non-essential procedures, including non-urgent iron infusions, have been rescheduled.
32438763,Oral iron, including both the traditional formulations with ferrous iron and the new ferric iron complexes, could constitute a valid alternative for anemia treatment.
32438763,For this reason, we conducted a literature review, to summarize the scientific evidence on oral iron therapy in IBD patients with anemia.
32438839,The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has spread over many countries and regions since the end of 2019, becoming the most severe public health event at present.
32438839,Most of the critical cases developed multiple organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury (AKI).
32438839,Cytokine storm syndrome (CSS) may complicate the process of severe COVID-19 patients.
32438839,This manuscript reviews the different aspects of blood purification in critically ill patients with AKI and increased inflammatory factors, and examines its potential role in severe COVID-19 treatment.
32438839,Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) has been practiced in many sepsis patients with AKI.
32438839,Still, the timing and dosing need further robust evidence.
32438839,In addition to the traditional CRRT, the high-throughput membrane with adsorption function and cytokine adsorption column are two representatives of recently emerging novel membrane technologies.
32438839,Their potential in removing inflammatory factors and other toxins prospects for the treatment of severe COVID-19.
32438878,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is having a major clinical as well as organisational impact on the national health-care system in Italy, particularly in high-volume hospitals which are usually active for many essential clinical needs, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
32438878,Here, we report major clinical and organisational challenges at a high-volume Italian IBD centre one month after the start of the Italian government's restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
32438878,All routine follow-up IBD visits of patients in remission were cancelled or rescheduled for 8-12 weeks' time.
32438878,However, access to the hospital for therapy or for unstable/relapsing patients was not considered postponable.
32438878,Everyone attending the centre (e.g. physicians, nurses, administrative personnel and patients) were advised to respect the general recommended rules for hand hygiene and social distancing, to disclose if they had a fever or cough or flu-like symptoms and to wear a surgical mask and gloves.
32438878,At the entrance of the therapy area, a control station was set up in order to double-check all patients with a clinical interview and conduct thermal scanning.
32438878,A total of 1451 IBD patients under biotechnological or experimental therapy actively followed in the CEMAD IBD centre were included in the study.
32438878,About 65% of patients maintained their appointment schedules without major problems, while in 20% of cases planned infusions were delayed because of the patient's decision or practical issues.
32438878,About 10% of patients receiving subcutaneous therapy were allowed to collect their medicine without a follow-up visit.
32438878,Finally, 10% of patients living outside the Lazio region requested access to their therapy at a local centre closer to their home.
32438878,At present, five patients have been found to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection but with minimal symptoms, 22 are in 'quarantine' for contact considered to be 'at risk' for the infection.
32438878,Up to now, none of them has experienced significant symptoms.
32438878,This study represents the first observational detailed report about short-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patient organisation and management in a high-volume IBD centre.
32439198,COVID-19 is now pandemic throughout the world.
32439198,Scientist, doctors are searching for effective therapy of this diseases.
32439198,The remdesivir, an antiviral drug, is appeared as 'molecule of hope' for the treatment of this disease.
32439198,USFDA approve this drug for the treatment of COVID-19.
32439198,The molecular mechanism is unknown.
32439198,In this paper, we tried to describe the probable molecular mechanism of remdesivir to inhibit the RNA synthesis of SARS-CoV-2.
32439198,However, more detail mechanism is needed to understand mechanism of action of remdesivir.
32439237,Liver transplantation is considered the ultimate solution for patients with end-stage chronic liver disease or acute liver failure.
32439237,Patients with liver transplant need special care starting from preoperative preparation, surgical intervention ending with postoperative care.
32439237,Transplanted patients have to receive immunosuppressive therapy to prevent rejection.
32439237,Such a state of immune suppression could predispose to different types of infections in liver transplant recipients.
32439237,Currently, the world is suffering a pandemic caused by a new strain of the coronavirus family called COVID-19.
32439237,Certain infection control precautions are needed to protect immunocompromised and vulnerable patients, including liver transplant candidates and recipients from acquiring COVID-19 infection.
32439237,Restricting non-transplant elective surgical procedures, managing transplant patients in separate outpatient clinics, and in-patient wards can prevent transmission of infection both to patients and healthcare workers.
32439237,Telemedicine can help in the triage of patients to screen for symptoms of COVID-19 before their regular appointment.
32439237,Management of immunosuppressive therapy and drug-drug interactions in liver transplant recipients infected with COVID-19 should be cautiously practiced to prevent rejection and effectively treat the underlying infection.
32439237,In this report, we are trying to summarize available evidence about different aspects of the management of liver transplant candidates and recipients in the era of COVID-19.
32439309,The new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes a severe acute respiratory syndrome emerges in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.
32439309,It produces the aforementioned disease due to coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), and has led to a declaration of a world public health emergency by the World Health Organisation.
32439309,This new SARS-CoV-2 virus could share characteristics and an immune response similar to those described for other coronavirus.
32439309,Given its activity on the interferon pathway, and the manner in which it dysregulates innate immunity, the use of treatments directed at modulating or containing this could be of interest.
32439309,A narrative review was made of the current evidence about immunity against coronavirus and its applicability to SARS-CoV-2.
32439309,The physiopathogenesis is also described, along with the underlying leucocyte activity, with the intention of clarifying the possible usefulness of inflammatory biomarkers and the development of personalised treatments.
32439366,Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin combination therapy is often prescribed for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32439366,Electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring is warranted because both medications cause corrected QT-interval (QTc) prolongation.
32439366,Whether QTc duration significantly varies during the day, potentially requiring multiple ECGs, remains to be established.
32439366,We performed 12‑lead ECGs and 12‑lead 24-h Holter ECG monitoring in all patients aged &lt;80 years admitted to our medical unit for COVID-19, in oral therapy with hydroxychloroquine (200 mg, twice daily) and azithromycin (500 mg, once daily) for at least 3 days.
32439366,A group of healthy individuals matched for age and sex served as control.
32439366,Out of 126 patients, 22 (median age 64, 82% men) met the inclusion criteria.
32439366,ECG after therapy showed longer QTc-interval than before therapy (450 vs 426 ms, p = .02).
32439366,Four patients had a QTc ≥ 480 ms: they showed higher values of aspartate aminotransferase (52 vs 30 U/L, p = .03) and alanine aminotransferase (108 vs 33 U/L, p &lt; .01) compared with those with QTc &lt; 480 ms.
32439366,At 24-h Holter ECG monitoring, 1 COVID-19 patient and no control had ≥1 run of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (p = .4).
32439366,No patients showed &quot;R on T&quot; premature ventricular beats.
32439366,Analysis of 24-h QTc dynamics revealed that COVID-19 patients had higher QTc values than controls, with no significant hourly variability.
32439366,Therapy with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin prolongs QTc interval in patients with COVID-19, particularly in those with high levels of transaminases.
32439366,Because QTc duration remains stable during the 24 h, multiple daily ECG are not recommendable.
32439516,As the COVID-19 pandemic wears on, its psychological, emotional, and existential toll continues to grow and indeed may now rival the physical suffering caused by the illness.
32439516,Patients, caregivers, and healthcare workers are particularly at risk for trauma responses and would be well served by trauma-informed care (TIC) practices to minimize both immediate and long-term psychological distress.
32439516,Given the significant overlap between the core tenets of TIC and accepted guidelines for the provision of quality palliative care (PC), PC teams are particularly well poised to both incorporate such practices into routine care and to argue for their integration across health systems.
32439516,We outline this intersection in order to highlight the uniquely powerful role PC teams can play to reduce the long-term psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
32439650,Thrombectomy for large-vessel-occlusion stroke is a highly impactful treatment.
32439650,The spread of coronavirus 19 (COVID-19) across the United States and the globe impacts access to this crucial intervention through widespread societal and institutional changes.
32439650,In this document, we review the implications of COVID-19 on the emergency care of large-vessel occlusion stroke, reviewing specific infection-control recommendations, available literature, existing resources, and expert consensus.
32439650,As a population, patients with large-vessel occlusion stroke face unique challenges during pandemics.
32439650,These are broad in scope.
32439650,Responses to these challenges through adaptation of stroke systems of care and with imaging, thrombectomy, and postprocedural care are detailed.
32439650,Preservation of access to thrombectomy must be prioritized for its public health impact.
32439650,While the extent of required changes will vary by region, tiered planning for both escalation and de-escalation of measures must be a part of each practice.
32439650,In addition, preparations described serve as templates in the event of future pandemics.
32439821,To report 3 patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) who developed generalized myoclonus.
32439821,Patient data were obtained from medical records from the University Hospital &quot;12 de Octubre,&quot; Madrid, Spain.
32439821,Three patients (2 men, and one woman, aged 63-88) presented with mild hypersomnia and generalized myoclonus following the onset of the so-called &quot;inflammatory&quot; phase of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32439821,All of them had presented previously with anosmia.
32439821,Myoclonus had a stereotypical pattern, being both positive and negative, generalized, with a predominant involvement of nasopharyngeal, facial, and upper limbs areas.
32439821,These jerky movements occurred spontaneously and were extremely sensitive to multisensory stimuli (auditive and tactile) or voluntary movement, with an exaggerated startle response.
32439821,Other causes of myoclonus were ruled-out, and none of them had undergone respiratory arrest or significant prolonged hypoxia.
32439821,All of them improved, at least partially, with immunotherapy.
32439821,Our 3 cases highlight the occurrence of myoclonus during the COVID-19 pandemic as a postinfectious/immune-mediated disorder.
32439821,However, we cannot rule out that SARS-CoV-2 may spread transneuronally to first- and second-order structures connected with the olfactory bulb.
32439821,Further investigation is required to clarify the full clinical spectrum of neurologic symptoms and its optimal treatment.
32439956,There is limited information about newborns with confirmed or suspected COVID-19.
32439956,Particularly in the hospital after delivery, clinicians have refined practices in order to prevent secondary infection.
32439956,While guidance from international associations is continuously being updated, all facets of care of neonates born to women with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 are center-specific, given local customs, building infrastructure constraints, and availability of protective equipment.
32439956,Based on anecdotal reports from institutions in the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic close to our hospital, together with our limited experience, in anticipation of increasing numbers of exposed newborns, we have developed a triage algorithm at the Penn State Hospital at Milton S.
32439956,Hershey Medical Center that may be useful for other centers anticipating a similar surge.
32439956,We discuss several care practices that have changed in the COVID-19 era including the use of antenatal steroids, delayed cord clamping (DCC), mother-newborn separation, and breastfeeding.
32439956,Moreover, this paper provides comprehensive guidance on the most suitable respiratory support for newborns during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32439956,We also present detailed recommendations about the discharge process and beyond, including providing scales and home phototherapy to families, parental teaching via telehealth and in-person education at the doors of the hospital, and telehealth newborn follow-up.
32440386,The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an unprecedented situation where the standard of care (SOC) management for cancers has been altered significantly.
32440386,Patients with potentially curable cancers are at risk of not receiving timely SOC multidisciplinary treatments, such as surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or combination treatments.
32440386,Hospital resources are in such high demand for COVID-19 patients that procedures, such as surgery, dentistry, interventional radiology, and other ancillary services, are not available for cancer patients.
32440386,Our tertiary care center is considered the center of the epicenter in the USA.
32440386,As a result, all non-emergent surgeries have been suspended in order to provide hospital beds and other resources for COVID-19 patients.
32440386,Additionally, ambulatory efforts to avoid treatment-related morbidity are critical for keeping patients out of emergency departments and hospitals.
32440386,In this review article, we discuss evidence-based radiation therapy approaches for curable cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32440386,We focus on three scenarios of cancer care: 1) radiation therapy as an alternative to surgery when immediate surgery is not possible, 2) radiation therapy as a 'bridge' to surgery, and 3) radiation options definitively or postoperatively, given the risk of hospitalization with high-dose chemotherapy.
32440661,World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a pandemic and a global health emergency.
32440661,Thus, it is necessary to clearly characterize clinical manifestations and management of COVID-19 infection in children to provide accurate information for healthcare workers.
32440661,Accordingly, the present study was designed to review articles published on clinical manifestations and characteristics of children and infants with COVID-19.
32440661,In this systematic review, medical databases including Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Embase, Scopus, SID, Medline, WHO and LitCovid were searched using English and Persian keywords including COVID-19, Pediatrics, Newborn, Coronavirus 2019, 2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV-2.
32440661,Finally, data of 14 related articles were included in the study.
32440661,A total of 2228 children, newborns and infants were studied.
32440661,Clinical manifestation in children may be mild (72%), moderate (22%) or severe (6%), and the most common symptoms include dry cough (91%) and fever (96%).
32440661,According to the included articles, two children had died, one of which was a 14-year-old boy and his exposure history and underlying disease were unclear, and the other was a male newborn with gestational age of 35 weeks and 5 days, birth weight of 2200, Apgar score of 8, 8 (1 min and 5 min) and his first symptom was increased heart rate.
32440661,No differences were found between male and female children regarding infection with COVID-19.
32440661,Most pediatrics were infected with COVID-19 due to family cluster or history of close contact.
32440661,Infected children have relatively milder clinical symptoms compared to infected adults.
32440661,We should pay special attention to early diagnosis and early treatment in children infected with COVID-19.
32440662,The novel coronavirus is rapidly spreading around the world.
32440662,Since the public announcement of the COVID-19 outbreak, several concerns have been raised by dermatologists as well as pemphigus patients who take immunosuppressive drugs.
32440662,In this paper, we review the literature about the common treatment of pemphigus with a focus on the lessons from similar epidemics to find a proper suggestion to manage pemphigus in the COVID-19 pandemic era.
32440662,The effect of many of the drugs used for treatment of Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) on COVID-19 is not clear.
32440662,We also do not have data on the impact of this autoimmune disease, which may involve the mucous membranes, on the acquisition or course of COVID-19.
32440662,We are currently in the midst of a pandemic and evaluating the effect of COVID-19 on the population of susceptible patients suffering from auto-immune diseases like pemphigus is essential.
32440662,The evidence on best ways to manage patients with underlying conditions, such as pemphigus, during the outbreak of COVID-19 is evolving and the data is updated every day.
32440883,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a viral infection that can, in severe cases, result in cytokine storm, systemic inflammatory response and coagulopathy that is prognostic of poor outcomes.
32440883,While some, but not all, laboratory findings appear similar to sepsis-associated disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), COVID-19- induced coagulopathy (CIC) appears to be more prothrombotic than hemorrhagic.
32440883,It has been postulated that CIC may be an uncontrolled immunothrombotic response to COVID-19, and there is growing evidence of venous and arterial thromboembolic events in these critically ill patients.
32440883,Clinicians around the globe are challenged with rapidly identifying reasonable diagnostic, monitoring and anticoagulant strategies to safely and effectively manage these patients.
32440883,Thoughtful use of proven, evidence-based approaches must be carefully balanced with integration of rapidly emerging evidence and growing experience.
32440883,The goal of this document is to provide guidance from the Anticoagulation Forum, a North American organization of anticoagulation providers, regarding use of anticoagulant therapies in patients with COVID-19.
32440883,We discuss in-hospital and post-discharge venous thromboembolism (VTE) prevention, treatment of suspected but unconfirmed VTE, laboratory monitoring of COVID-19, associated anticoagulant therapies, and essential elements for optimized transitions of care specific to patients with COVID-19.
32440979,As a consequence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, a large amount of consultations will be delivered through tele-medicine, especially for diseases causing chronic disability and requiring immunomodulatory treatments, such as multiple sclerosis (MS).
32440979,We have hereby reviewed available tools for tele-neurology examination in MS, including components of neurological examination that can be assessed through video, patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), and digital technology.
32440979,Overall, we have suggested a battery for assessing MS disability and relapses on tele-medicine, which brings together conventional examination, PROMs (e.g., Patient Determined Disease Steps, MS Impact Scale), and cognitive tests (Symbol Digit Modalities Test) that can be delivered remotely and in multiple languages.
32440979,The use of common tools for neurological examination could improve tele-neurology practice for both general neurologists and MS specialists, and quality of care for people with MS.
32441196,The 2019 coronavirus infection (called SARS-CoV-2) began in Wuhan, spread rapidly throughout the world.
32441196,In many countries the exponential growth of Covid-19 cases is overwhelming health care systems with overcrowding of hospitals and overflowing Intensive Care Units.
32441196,While people must stay at home to reduce the spread of this virus health-care workers do the exact opposite.
32441196,In some countries doctors are working with insufficient protection and are constantly at risk of contracting Covid-19.
32441196,Health-care workers should be constantly monitored because if they are infected they may spread the virus to colleagues, hospitalized patients and even family members.
32441196,Increased rates of infection in health-care workers could cause the health-care system to collapse and a further worsening of the pandemic; if there are too few doctors it will be even more difficult to manage.
32441232,In response to the rapid spread of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), healthcare systems should establish procedures for early recognition and management of suspected or confirmed cases.
32441232,We describe the various steps taken for the development, implementation, and dissemination of the interdisciplinary COVID-19 protocol at Jackson Health System (JHS), a complex tertiary academic health system in Miami, Florida.
32441232,Recognizing the dynamic nature of COVID-19, the protocol addresses the potential investigational treatment options and considerations for special populations.
32441232,The protocol also includes infection prevention and control measures and routine care for suspected or proven COVID-19 patients.
32441332,The aim of this study is to report our clinical experience in the management of pregnant women infected with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) during the first thirty days of the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.
32441332,We reviewed clinical data from the first 60 pregnant women with COVID-19 whose care was managed at Puerta de Hierro University Hospital, Madrid, Spain from March 14<sup>th</sup> to April 14<sup>th</sup> , 2020.
32441332,Demographic data, clinical findings, laboratory test results, imaging findings, treatment received, and outcomes were collected.
32441332,An analysis of variance (Kruskal-Wallis test) was performed to compare the medians of laboratory parameters.
32441332,Fisher's exact test was used to evaluate categorical variables.
32441332,A correspondence analysis was used to explore associations between variables.
32441332,A total of 60 pregnant women were diagnosed with COVID-19.
32441332,The most common symptoms were fever and cough (75.5%, each) followed by dyspnea (37.8%).
32441332,Forty-one patients (68.6%) required hospital admission (18 due to disease worsening and 23 for delivery) of whom 21 patients (35%) underwent pharmacological treatment, including hydroxychloroquine, antivirals, antibiotics and tocilizumab.
32441332,No renal or cardiac failures or maternal deaths were reported.
32441332,Lymphopenia (50%), thrombocytopenia (25%), and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) (59%) were observed in the early stages of the disease.
32441332,Median CRP, D-dimer and the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio were elevated.
32441332,High CRP and D-dimer levels were the parameters most frequently associated with severe pneumonia.
32441332,The Neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio was found to be the most sensitive marker for disease improvement (relative risk: 6.65; 95% CI: 4.1-5.9).
32441332,During the study period, 18 of the women (78%) delivered vaginally.
32441332,All newborns tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 and none of them were infected during breastfeeding.
32441332,No SARS-CoV-2 was detected in placental tissue.
32441332,Most of the pregnant COVID-19 positive patients had a favorable clinical course.
32441332,However, one-third of them developed pneumonia, of whom 5% presented a critical clinical status.
32441332,CRP and D-dimer levels positively correlated with severe pneumonia and the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio decreased as the patients improved clinically.
32441332,Seventy-eight percent of patients had a vaginal delivery.
32441332,No vertical or horizontal transmissions were diagnosed in the neonates during labor or breastfeeding.
32441462,The global response to finding therapeutics for COVID-19 is chaotic even if well intentioned.
32441462,There is an opportunity, but more importantly, an obligation for the global clinical and quantitative pharmacology community to come together and use our state-of-the-art tools and expertise to help society accelerate therapeutics to fight COVID-19.
32441462,This brief commentary is a call to action and highlights how the global pharmacology community should contribute to the COVID-19 pandemic and prepare for future pandemics.
32441764,Clinically approved PARP inhibitors (PARPi) have a mild adverse effect profile and are well-tolerated as continuous daily oral therapy.
32441764,We review the evidence that justifies the repurposing of PARPi to block the proliferation of SARS-CoV-2 and combat the life-threatening sequelae of COVID-19 by several mechanisms.
32441764,PARPi's can effectively decrease IL-6, IL-1 and TNFα levels (key interleukins in SARS-CoV-2-induced cytokine storm) and can alleviate subsequent lung fibrosis, as demonstrated in murine experiments and clinical trials.
32441764,PARPi can tune macrophages towards a tolerogenic phenotype.
32441764,PARPi's may also counteract SARS-CoV-2-induced and inflammation-induced cell death and support cell survival.
32441764,PARPi's had beneficial effects in animal models of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), asthma and ventilator-induced lung injury.
32441764,PARPi's may potentiate the effectiveness of Tocilizumab, Anakinra, Sarilumab, Adalimumab, Canakinumab or Siltuximab therapy.
32441764,In summary, the evidence suggests that PARPi therapy would benefit COVID-19 patients and trials of these drugs should be undertaken.
32441771,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection causes high morbidity and mortality in older adults with chronic illnesses.
32441771,Several trials are currently underway evaluating the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine as a potential treatment for acute infection.
32441771,However, polypharmacy predisposes patients to increased risk of drug-drug interactions with hydroxychloroquine and may render many in this population ineligible to participate in trials.
32441771,We aimed to quantify the degree of polypharmacy and burden of potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) that older hospitalized adults are taking which would interact with hydroxychloroquine.
32441771,We reanalyzed data from the cohort of patients 65 years and older enrolled in the MedSafer pilot study.
32441771,We first identified patients taking medications with potentially harmful drug-drug interactions with hydroxychloroquine that might exclude them from participation in a typical coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) therapeutic trial.
32441771,Next, we identified medications that were flagged by MedSafer as being potentially inappropriate and crafted guidance around medication management if contemplating the use of hydroxychloroquine.
32441771,The cohort contained a total of 1,001 unique patients with complete data on their home medications at admission.
32441771,Of these 1,001 patients, 590 (58.9%) were receiving one or more home medications that could potentially interact with hydroxychloroquine, and of these 255 (43.2%) were flagged as potentially inappropriate by the MedSafer tool.
32441771,Common classes of PIMs observed were antipsychotics, cardiac medications, and anti-diabetic agents.
32441771,The COVID-19 pandemic highlights the importance of medication optimization and deprescribing PIMs in older adults.
32441771,By acting now to reduce polypharmacy and use of PIMs, we can better prepare this vulnerable population for inclusion in trials and, if substantiated, pharmacologic treatment or prevention of COVID-19.

32441773,The worldwide pandemic of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has raised many challenges and uncertainties regarding disease management and prognosis in immunocompromised patient populations.
32441773,The concurrence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19, presents an intriguing problem and only a handful of these cases exist in the literature, despite 37.9 million people living with HIV throughout the world.
32441773,Previous reports suggest the possibility of a protective factor from standard antiretroviral treatment for HIV patients that could have significant clinical benefits for these patients when co-infected with SARS-CoV-2.
32441773,HIV patients also generally present with atypical clinical presentation and have a less severe form of COVID-19 than the general population.
32441773,Here, we present the first case of an HIV positive patient who was diagnosed with COVID-19 in the United States.

32441783,Severe pneumonia which shares several of the features of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the main cause of morbidity and mortality in Coronavirus disease 19 (Covid-19) for which as of now there is no effective treatment.
32441783,ARDS is caused and sustained by an uncontrolled inflammatory activation characterized by a massive release of cytokines (cytokine storm), diffuse lung edema, inflammatory cell infiltraton and disseminated coagulation.
32441783,Macrophage and T lymphocyte dysfunction plays a central role in this syndrome.
32441783,In several experimental in vitro and in vivo models, many of these pathophysiological changes are triggered by stimulation of the P2X7 receptor.
32441783,We hypothesize that this receptor might be an ideal candidate to target in Covid-19-associated severe pneumonia.
32441786,The use of corticosteroids has been controversial in viral pneumonia.
32441786,In most cases, application of methylprednisolone in severe and critical viral pneumonia patients can quickly alleviate the symptoms of dyspnea and prevent disease progression.
32441786,However, some scholars have confirmed that corticosteroids delayed the body's clearance of the virus.
32441786,In our retrospective non-randomised study, 34 patients under 50 years old and diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were included, according to given methylprednisolone treatment (n = 18) or not (n = 16), they were separated into 2 groups.
32441786,By comparing the clinical data we concluded that corticosteroids therapy can effectively release COVID-19 symptoms such as persistent fever and difficult breathing, improve oxygenation and prevent disease progression.
32441786,However, it can prolong the negative conversion of nucleic acids.

32441787,Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a newly emerging infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32441787,After its first occurrence in Wuhan of China from December 2019, COVID-19 rapidly spread around the world.
32441787,Studies have shown that coagulation dysfunction is one of the important reason causing death of COVID-19 patients and appeared in many patients.
32441787,However, cases of COVID-19 with immune thrombocytopenic purpura were very rare.
32441787,Here, a patient with immune thrombocytopenic purpura in Huoshenshan Hospital (Wuhan, China) was reported, whose laboratory data, clinical treatment and hospital outcome was described in this study.
32441787,Fortunately, immune thrombocytopenic purpura with COVID-19 of the patient was diagnosed and treated in time and cured eventually.
32441787,This case illustrates the need to be vigilant for complications associated with COVID-19.

32441788,Many critically ill patients with COVID-19 need specialty level palliative care to manage symptoms, conduct goals of care conversations, and facilitate medical decision making in ethically and emotionally charged situations.
32441788,During the apex of the COVID-19 crisis in New York, the Adult Palliative Care Service at Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC)/NewYork-Presbyterian (NYP) received a 7-fold increase in consultation requests.
32441788,This unprecedented increase in demand outpaced the palliative care team's ability to respond.
32441788,We describe the rapid development and implementation of a scalable virtual consultation model staffed by out-of-state palliative care specialist volunteers.

32441805,Acute lung injury (ALI) represents the most severe form of the viral infection sustained by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32441805,Today, it is a pandemic infection, and even if several compounds are used as curative or supportive treatment, there is not a definitive treatment.
32441805,In particular, antiviral treatment used for the treatment of several viral infections (eg, hepatitis C, HIV, Ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus) are today used with a mild or moderate effect on the lung injury.
32441805,In fact, ALI seems to be related to the inflammatory burst and release of proinflammatory mediators that induce intra-alveolar fibrin accumulation that reduces the gas exchange.
32441805,Therefore, an add-on therapy with drugs able to reduce inflammation, edema, and cell activation has been proposed as well as a treatment with interferon, corticosteroids or monoclonal antibodies (eg, tocilizumab).
32441805,In this article reviewing literature data related to the use of escin, an agent having potent anti-inflammatory and anti-viral effects in lung injury, we suggest that it could represent a therapeutic opportunity as add-on therapy in ALI related to COVID-19 infection.
32442035,Mechanical ventilation is used to treat respiratory failure in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32442035,To review multiple streams of evidence regarding the benefits and harms of ventilation techniques for coronavirus infections, including that causing COVID-19.
32442035,(PROSPERO registration: CRD42020178187). 21 standard, World Health Organization-specific and COVID-19-specific databases, without language restrictions, until 1 May 2020.
32442035,Studies of any design and language comparing different oxygenation approaches in patients with coronavirus infections, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), or with hypoxemic respiratory failure.
32442035,Animal, mechanistic, laboratory, and preclinical evidence was gathered regarding aerosol dispersion of coronavirus.
32442035,Studies evaluating risk for virus transmission to health care workers from aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) were included.
32442035,Independent and duplicate screening, data abstraction, and risk of bias assessment (GRADE for certainty of evidence and AMSTAR 2 for included systematic reviews). 123 studies were eligible (45 on COVID-19, 70 on SARS, 8 on MERS), but only 5 studies (1 on COVID-19, 3 on SARS, 1 on MERS) adjusted for important confounders.
32442035,A study in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 reported slightly higher mortality with noninvasive ventilation (NIV) than with invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), but 2 opposing studies, 1 in patients with MERS and 1 in patients with SARS, suggest a reduction in mortality with NIV (very low-certainty evidence).
32442035,Two studies in patients with SARS report a reduction in mortality with NIV compared with no mechanical ventilation (low-certainty evidence).
32442035,Two systematic reviews suggest a large reduction in mortality with NIV compared with conventional oxygen therapy.
32442035,Other included studies suggest increased odds of transmission from AGPs.
32442035,Direct studies in COVID-19 are limited and poorly reported.
32442035,Indirect and low-certainty evidence suggests that use of NIV, similar to IMV, probably reduces mortality but may increase the risk for transmission of COVID-19 to health care workers.

32442105,SARS-COV-2 has recently emerged as a new public health threat.
32442105,Herein, we report that the FDA-approved drug, auranofin, inhibits SARS-COV-2 replication in human cells at low micro molar concentration.
32442105,Treatment of cells with auranofin resulted in a 95% reduction in the viral RNA at 48 h after infection.
32442105,Auranofin treatment dramatically reduced the expression of SARS-COV-2-induced cytokines in human cells.
32442105,These data indicate that auranofin could be a useful drug to limit SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated lung injury due to its antiviral, anti-inflammatory and anti-reactive oxygen species (ROS) properties.
32442105,Further animal studies are warranted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of auranofin for the management of SARS-COV-2 associated disease.
32442210,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus that has caused a worldwide pandemic of the human respiratory illness COVID-19, resulting in a severe threat to public health and safety.
32442210,Analysis of the genetic tree suggests that SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the same Betacoronavirus group as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).
32442210,Although the route for viral transmission remains a mystery, SARS-CoV-2 may have originated in an animal reservoir, likely that of bat.
32442210,The clinical features of COVID-19, such as fever, cough, shortness of breath, and fatigue, are similar to those of many acute respiratory infections.
32442210,There is currently no specific treatment for COVID-19, but antiviral therapy combined with supportive care is the main strategy.
32442210,Here, we summarize recent progress in understanding the epidemiological, virological, and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 and discuss potential targets with existing drugs for the treatment of this emerging zoonotic disease.
32442265,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, resulting in the coronavirus disease COVID-19) is highly transmissible among people.
32442265,Asymptomatic infections are also an important source of infection.
32442265,Here, we aimed to further clarify the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections.
32442265,We identified close contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases in northeast Chongqing who were RT-PCR+ yet remained asymptomatic throughout their infections.
32442265,We stratified this cohort by normal versus abnormal findings on chest CT, and compared the strata regarding comorbidities, demographics, laboratory findings, viral transmission and other factors.
32442265,Between January and March, 2020, we identified and hospitalized 279 RT-PCR+ contacts of COVID-19 patients.
32442265,Of these, 63 (23%) remained asymptomatic until discharge; 29 had abnormal and 34 had normal chest CT findings.
32442265,The mean cohort age was 39.3 years, and 87.3% had no comorbidities.
32442265,Mean time to diagnosis after close contact with a COVID-19 index patient was 16.0 days (range 1 to 29), and 13.4 days and 18.7 days for those with abnormal and normal CT findings, respectively (p &lt; 0.05).
32442265,Nine subjects (14.3%) transmitted the virus to others; 4 and 5 were in the abnormal and normal CT strata, respectively.
32442265,The median length of nucleic acid turning negative in asymptomatic COVID-19 patients was 13 days, compared to 10.4 days in those with normal chest CT (p &lt; 0.05).
32442265,A portion of these asymptomatic individuals, with and without abnormal chest CT scans, were capable of transmitting the virus to others.
32442265,Given the frequency and potential infectiousness of asymptomatic infections, testing of traced contacts is essential.
32442265,Studies of the impact of treatment on asymptomatic RT-PCR+ individuals on disease progression and transmission should be undertaken.
32442285,Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors may facilitate host cell entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or attenuate organ injury via RAAS blockade.
32442285,We aimed to assess the associations between prior use of RAAS inhibitors and clinical outcomes among Korean patients with coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).
32442285,We performed a nationwide population-based cohort study using the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment database.
32442285,Claim records were screened for 66793 individuals who were tested for COVID-19 until April 8, 2020.
32442285,Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were used to compare the clinical outcomes between RAAS inhibitor users and nonusers.
32442285,Among 5179 confirmed COVID-19 cases, 762 patients were RAAS inhibitor users and 4417 patients were nonusers.
32442285,Relative to nonusers, RAAS inhibitor users were more likely to be older, male, and have comorbidities.
32442285,Among 1954 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, 377 patients were RAAS inhibitor users and 1577 patients were nonusers.
32442285,In-hospital mortality was observed for 33 RAAS inhibitor users (9%) and 51 nonusers (3%) (p&lt;0.001).
32442285,However, after adjustment for age, sex, Charlson Comorbidity Index, immunosuppression, and hospital type, the use of RAAS inhibitors was not associated with a higher risk of mortality (adjusted OR, 0.88; 95% confidence interval, 0.53-1.44; p=0.60).
32442285,No significant differences were observed between RAAS inhibitor users and nonusers in terms of vasopressor use, modes of ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, renal replacement therapy, and acute cardiac events.
32442285,Our findings suggest that prior use of RAAS inhibitors was not independently associated with mortality among COVID-19 patients in Korea.
32442287,We previously reported that lymphocytopenia and T cell exhaustion is notable in acute COVID19 patients, especially in aged and severe cases.
32442287,Thymosin alpha 1 (Tα1) had been used in the treatment of viral infections as an immune response modifier for many years.
32442287,However, clinical benefits and mechanism of Tα1 supplement to COVID-19 are still unclear.
32442287,We retrospectively reviewed the clinical outcomes of 76 severe cases with COVID-19 admitted into two hospitals in Wuhan from December 2019 to March 2020.
32442287,The thymus output in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from COVID-19 patients was measured by T cell receptor excision circles (TREC).
32442287,The levels of T cell exhaustion markers PD-1 and Tim-3 on CD8+ T cells were detected by flow cytometry.
32442287,Compared with untreated group, Tα1 treatment significantly reduces mortality of severe COVID-19 patients (11.11% vs.
32442287,30.00%, p=0.044).
32442287,Tα1 timely enhances blood T cell numbers in COVID-19 patients with severe lymphocytopenia (the counts of CD8+ T cells or CD4+ T cells in circulation lower than 400/μL or 650/μL, respectively).
32442287,Under such conditions, Tα1 also successfully restores CD8+ and CD4+ T cell numbers in aged patients.
32442287,Meanwhile, Tα1 reduces PD-1 and Tim-3 expression on CD8+ T cells from severe COVID-19 patients in comparison with untreated cases.
32442287,It is of note that restoration of lymphocytopenia and acute exhaustion of T cells are roughly parallel to the rise of TRECs.
32442287,Tα1 supplement significantly reduce mortality of severe COVID-19 patients.
32442287,COVID-19 patients with the counts of CD8+ T cells or CD4+ T cells in circulation lower than 400/μL or 650/μL, respectively, gain more benefits from Tα1.
32442287,Tα1 reverses T cell exhaustion and recovers immune reconstitution through promoting thymus output during SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32442315,Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) plays an essential role in maintaining the balance of the renin-angiotensin system and also serves as a receptor for the SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and HCoV-NL63.
32442315,Following the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection, there has been an urgent need to develop therapeutic interventions.
32442315,ACE2 is a potential target for many treatment approaches for the SARS-CoV-2.
32442315,With the help of bioinformatics, we have predicted several novel exons of the human ACE2 gene.
32442315,The inclusion of novel exons located in the 5'UTR/intronic region in the mature transcript may remove the critical ACE2 residues responsible for the interaction with the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2, thus preventing their binding and entry into the cell.
32442315,Additionally, inclusion of a novel predicted exons located in the 3'UTR by alternative splicing may remove the C-terminal transmembrane domain of ACE2 and generate soluble ACE2 isoforms.
32442315,Splice-switching antisense oligonucleotides (SSOs) have been employed effectively as a therapeutic strategy in several disease conditions.
32442315,Alternative splicing of the ACE2 gene could similarly be modulated using SSOs to exclude critical domains required for the entry of SARS-CoV-2.
32442315,Strategies can also be designed to deliver these SSOs directly to the lungs in order to minimize the damage caused by SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.
32442317,COVID-19, the disease resulting from infection by a novel coronavirus: SARS-Cov2 that has rapidly spread since November 2019 leading to a global pandemic.
32442317,SARS-Cov2 has infected over 4 million people and caused over 290,000 deaths worldwide.
32442317,Although most cases are mild, a subset of patients develop a severe and atypical presentation of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) that is characterised by a cytokine release storm (CRS).
32442317,Paradoxically, treatment with anti-inflammatory agents and immune regulators has been associated with worsening of ARDS.
32442317,We hypothesize that the intrinsic circadian clock of the lung and the immune system may regulate individual components of CRS and thus chronotherapy may be used to effectively manage ARDS in COVID-19 patients.
32442347,Arising from the city of Wuhan, Hubei province in China, a novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has been rapidly spreading since its first presentation in late 2019.
32442347,The World Health Organization declared a pandemic on the 11th March 2020, and as of 29th of April 2020 more than 3 million cases have been reported worldwide with over 225 000 confirmed deaths.
32442347,Where mechanical ventilation may not be enough, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) could play a role as a form of rescue therapy and may provide beneficial results in the hands of skilled clinicians in centers with experience of using ECMO appropriately in selected patients.
32442347,Our understanding of COVID-19 is ever-changing and the need for intensive care beds is rising, which means that ECMO will surely play a key role in the near future.
32442437,Ubiquitin Proteasome System (UPS) is an adaptable and finely tuned system that sustains proteostasis network under a large variety of physiopathological conditions.
32442437,Its dysregulation is often associated with the onset and progression of human diseases; hence, UPS modulation has emerged as a promising new avenue for the development of treatments of several relevant pathologies, such as cancer and neurodegeneration.
32442437,The clinical interest in proteasome inhibition has considerably increased after the FDA approval in 2003 of bortezomib for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, which is now used in the front-line setting.
32442437,Thereafter, two other proteasome inhibitors (carfilzomib and ixazomib), designed to overcome resistance to bortezomib, have been approved for treatment-experienced patients, and a variety of novel inhibitors are currently under preclinical and clinical investigation not only for haematological malignancies but also for solid tumours.
32442437,However, since UPS collapse leads to toxic misfolded proteins accumulation, proteasome is attracting even more interest as a target for the care of neurodegenerative diseases, which are sustained by UPS impairment.
32442437,Thus, conceptually, proteasome activation represents an innovative and largely unexplored target for drug development.
32442437,According to a multidisciplinary approach, spanning from chemistry, biochemistry, molecular biology to pharmacology, this review will summarize the most recent available literature regarding different aspects of proteasome biology, focusing on structure, function and regulation of proteasome in physiological and pathological processes, mostly cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, connecting biochemical features and clinical studies of proteasome targeting drugs.
32442528,Over 40 000 patients with COVID-19 have been hospitalised in New York City (NY, USA) as of April 28, 2020.
32442528,Data on the epidemiology, clinical course, and outcomes of critically ill patients with COVID-19 in this setting are needed.
32442528,This prospective observational cohort study took place at two NewYork-Presbyterian hospitals affiliated with Columbia University Irving Medical Center in northern Manhattan.
32442528,We prospectively identified adult patients (aged ≥18 years) admitted to both hospitals from March 2 to April 1, 2020, who were diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and were critically ill with acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure, and collected clinical, biomarker, and treatment data.
32442528,The primary outcome was the rate of in-hospital death.
32442528,Secondary outcomes included frequency and duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, frequency of vasopressor use and renal replacement therapy, and time to in-hospital clinical deterioration following admission.
32442528,The relation between clinical risk factors, biomarkers, and in-hospital mortality was modelled using Cox proportional hazards regression.
32442528,Follow-up time was right-censored on April 28, 2020 so that each patient had at least 28 days of observation.
32442528,Between March 2 and April 1, 2020, 1150 adults were admitted to both hospitals with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, of which 257 (22%) were critically ill.
32442528,The median age of patients was 62 years (IQR 51-72), 171 (67%) were men. 212 (82%) patients had at least one chronic illness, the most common of which were hypertension (162 [63%]) and diabetes (92 [36%]). 119 (46%) patients had obesity.
32442528,As of April 28, 2020, 101 (39%) patients had died and 94 (37%) remained hospitalised. 203 (79%) patients received invasive mechanical ventilation for a median of 18 days (IQR 9-28), 170 (66%) of 257 patients received vasopressors and 79 (31%) received renal replacement therapy.
32442528,The median time to in-hospital deterioration was 3 days (IQR 1-6).
32442528,In the multivariable Cox model, older age (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1·31 [1·09-1·57] per 10-year increase), chronic cardiac disease (aHR 1·76 [1·08-2·86]), chronic pulmonary disease (aHR 2·94 [1·48-5·84]), higher concentrations of interleukin-6 (aHR 1·11 [95%CI 1·02-1·20] per decile increase), and higher concentrations of D-dimer (aHR 1·10 [1·01-1·19] per decile increase) were independently associated with in-hospital mortality.
32442528,Critical illness among patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in New York City is common and associated with a high frequency of invasive mechanical ventilation, extrapulmonary organ dysfunction, and substantial in-hospital mortality.
32442528,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, National Institutes of Health, and the Columbia University Irving Institute for Clinical and Translational Research.
32442699,While evidence suggests that hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) may decrease the viral load in patients with a COVID-19 infection, a number of case reports indicate adverse dermatologic effects of this potential treatment.
32442699,To conduct a systematic review of previously reported cases of psoriasis onset, exacerbation, or relapse after HCQ treatment.
32442699,A comprehensive EMBASE and MEDLINE search of original studies examining adverse effects of HCQ treatment related to psoriasis was conducted.
32442699,Participant demographics, and details of HCQ administration and psoriasis diagnosis were extracted from 15 articles representing 18 patients.
32442699,Females accounted for a significantly larger number of psoriatic cases compared to males and unreported sex (n=14, 77.8% vs. n=2, 11.1% vs n=2, 11.1% respectively).
32442699,Additionally, 50% (n=9) of the cases did not have a history of psoriasis prior to taking HCQ.
32442699,Of the 18 patients, 50.0% (n=9) experienced de novo psoriasis, 27.8% (n=5) experienced exacerbation of psoriatic symptoms and 22.2% (n=4) had a relapse of psoriasis after HCQ administration.
32442699,HCQ treatment may result in induction, exacerbation, or relapse of psoriasis.
32442699,Monitoring for adverse effects of HCQ treatment is necessary, and clinical trials are essential in characterizing the safety profile of HCQ use in patients with a COVID-19 infection.
32442720,The epidemic of pneumonia (COVID-19) caused by novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection has been listed as a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization (WHO), and its harm degree is defined as a global &quot;pandemic&quot;.
32442720,At present, the efforts of various countries focus on the rapid diagnosis and isolation of patients, as well as to find a treatment that can combat the most serious impact of the disease.
32442720,The number of reported COVID-19 virus infections is still increasing.
32442720,Unfortunately, no drugs or vaccines have been approved for the treatment of human coronaviruses, but there is an urgent need for in-depth research on emerging human infectious coronaviruses.
32442720,Clarification transmission routes and pathogenic mechanisms, and identification of potential drug treatment targets will promote the development of effective prevention and treatment measures.
32442720,In the absence of confirmed effective treatments, due to public health emergencies, it is essential to study the possible effects of existing approved antivirals drugs or Chinese herbal medicines for SARS-CoV-2.
32442720,This review summarizes the epidemiological characteristics, pathogenesis, virus structure and targeting strategies of COVID-19.
32442720,Meanwhile, this review also focus on the re-purposing of clinically approved drugs and Chinese herbal medicines that may be used to treat COVID-19 and provide new ideas for the discovery of small molecular compounds with potential therapeutic effects on novel COVID-19.
32442894,The current Covid-19 pandemic is posing an unprecedented threat to global well-being and its mental health consequences are just becoming understood.
32442894,While the crisis has led to a temporary halt in a lot of ongoing or planned psychiatric research, this pandemic is a natural experiment that can help the field to repurpose research to better understand the causes, presentations and outcome trajectories as well as treatments in psychiatry.
32442894,Inter-disciplinary collaborations between researchers are needed to rapidly develop and share the emerging new knowledge of the mental health implications of Covid-19, This will help mount an effective response to the current as well as future pandemics.
32442939,There are increasing reports of a drastic drop in consultations and cardiovascular procedures (including urgencies and emergencies) in regions affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with a consequent marked increase in total mortality that is not fully explained by COVID-19.
32442939,Cardiovascular disease leads the ranking in deaths in adults in Argentina with 280 deaths per day, and in recent decades we have reduced its mortality by 20-30% through various evidence-based interventions.
32442939,Herein we conducted predictive analyses to understand what could be the consequences of a worse implementation of those interventions.
32442939,We estimate that less control of cardiovascular risk factors from April to October 2020 could cause up to 10 500 new preventable cases of cardiovascular disease.
32442939,In terms of myocardial infarction, a drop from 40% to 60% of the reperfusion treatment could increase mortality by 3% to 5%.
32442939,A marginal 10% to 15% increase in relative risk of cardiovascular death would be equivalent to an excess of 6000 to 9000 preventable deaths.
32442939,In conclusion, given the high prevalence and fatality of cardiovascular disease, even a small negative impact on the efficacy of its care will translate into large numbers of people affected in Argentina.
32442939,It is necessary to inform the authorities and educate the public so cardiovascular diseases and their risk factors remain a health priority, as long as resources exist and minimizing the risk of contagion and spread of the virus.
32442939,Existen crecientes informes sobre una drástica caída en consultas y realización de procedimientos cardiovasculares (incluyendo urgencias y emergencias) en regiones afectadas por la pandemia de COVID-19, con el consecuente incremento marcado de la mortalidad total que no se explica totalmente por las defunciones atribuidas a COVID-19.
32442939,En Argentina, la enfermedad cardiovascular lidera el ranking de muertes en adultos con 280 muertes por día, y en las últimas décadas hemos reducido su mortalidad entre 20 y 30% mediante diversas intervenciones basadas en la evidencia.
32442939,En el presente trabajo realizamos análisis predictivos para entender cuáles podrían ser las consecuencias de una peor implementación de dichas intervenciones.
32442939,Estimamos que un menor control de los factores de riesgo cardiovascular de abril a octubre de 2020 podría causar hasta 10 500 nuevos casos prevenibles de enfermedad cardiovascular.
32442939,En términos de infarto de miocardio, una caída del 40% al 60% del tratamiento de reperfusión podría incrementar la mortalidad del 3% al 5%.
32442939,Un incremento marginal de riesgo relativo de 10% a 15% de muerte cardiovascular equivaldría a un exceso de 6000 a 9000 muertes evitables.
32442939,En conclusión, dada la alta prevalencia y fatalidad de la enfermedad cardiovascular, incluso un pequeño impacto negativo en la eficacia de su cuidado se traducirá en grandes cantidades de afectados en Argentina.
32442939,Es necesario informar a las autoridades y educar al público para que sigan controlando enfermedades cardiovasculares y sus factores de riesgo, siempre que existan recursos y minimizando el riesgo de contagio y propagación del virus.
32442941,Due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, a wide number of compounds are under scrutiny regarding their antiviral activity, one of them being hydroxychloroquine.
32442941,Cardiac aspects of the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are reviewed in this manuscript.
32442941,A non-systematic review of the medical literature was performed.
32442941,Information about their safety and efficacy as antimalarials, antivirals, as well as in the long-term treatment of rheumatic diseases was collected.
32442941,We found an anti-inflammatory effect with reduction of longterm cardiovascular events, a very infrequent heart disease due to a lysosomal effect of the drug, and at the hemodynamic level hypotension, tachycardia, and QT interval prolongation, exacerbated when combined with azithromycin.
32442941,However, the rate of adverse cardiac events of hydroxychloroquine (and chloroquine) was low.
32442941,Ante la pandemia de COVID-19 (del inglés coronavirus disease 2019), uno de los fármacos propuesto para su tratamiento es la hidroxicloroquina.
32442941,Se revisan aquí aspectos cardiológicos del uso de cloroquina e hidroxicloroquina.
32442941,Se realizó una revisión no sistemática en la literatura médica orientada a la búsqueda de información acerca de su seguridad y eficacia como antimaláricos y antivirales, así como en el tratamiento prolongado de enfermedades reumatológicas.
32442941,Se halló un efecto antiinflamatorio con reducción de eventos cardiovasculares a largo plazo, una cardiopatía muy infrecuente por un efecto lisosomal del fármaco, y a nivel hemodinámico hipotensión, taquicardia, y prolongación del intervalo QT, exacerbado si se combina con azitromicina.
32442941,Sin embargo, la tasa de eventos adversos cardíacos de la hidroxicloroquina y la cloroquina fue baja.
32443020,With the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, concerns have been raised about the risk to children with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD).
32443020,We aimed to collate global experience and provide provisional guidance for managing paediatric IBD (PIBD) in the era of COVID-19.
32443020,An electronic reporting system of children with IBD infected with SARS-CoV-2 has been circulated among 102 PIBD centres affiliated with the Porto and Interest-group of ESPGHAN.
32443020,A survey has been completed by major PIBD centres in China and South-Korea to explore management during the pandemic.
32443020,A third survey collected current practice of PIBD treatment.
32443020,Finally, guidance points for practice have been formulated and voted upon by 37 PIBD authors and Porto group members.
32443020,Eight PIBD children had COVID-19 globally, all with mild infection without needing hospitalization despite treatment with immunomodulators and/or biologics.
32443020,No cases have been reported in China and South Korea but biologic treatment has been delayed in 79 children, of whom 17 (22%) had exacerbation of their IBD.
32443020,Among the Porto group members, face-to-face appointments were often replaced by remote consultations but almost all did not change current IBD treatment.
32443020,Ten guidance points for clinicians caring for PIBD patients in epidemic areas have been endorsed with consensus rate of 92% to 100%.
32443020,Preliminary data for PIBD patients during COVID-19 outbreak are reassuring.
32443020,Standard IBD treatments including biologics should continue at present through the pandemic, especially in children who generally have more severe IBD course on one hand, and milder SARS-CoV-2 infection on the other.
32443163,The pharmacological and immunological properties of interferons, especially those of interferon beta, and the corresponding treatment strategies are described, and the results of studies with different interferons in coronavirus infections are analysed.
32443163,Furthermore, the data obtained with high-dosed native interferon beta in life-threatening acute viral diseases as well as the results of clinical pilot studies with high-dosed recombinant interferon beta-1a are provided because they serve as the rationale for the proposed therapeutic regimen to be applied in acute viral infections.
32443163,This regimen differs from those approved for treatment of multiple sclerosis and consists of interferon beta-1a administered as a 24 hour intravenous infusion at a daily dose of up to 90 µg for 3-5 consecutive days.
32443163,Since under this regimen transient severe side effects can occur, it is analysed which patients are suitable for this kind of treatment in general and if patients with severe coronavirus infections could also be treated accordingly.
32443202,Hospitals are important sources of pollutants resulted from diagnostic, laboratory and research activities as well as medicine excretion by patients, which include active component of drugs and metabolite, chemicals, residues of pharmaceuticals, radioactive markers, iodinated contrast media, etc.
32443202,The discharge of hospital wastes and wastewater, especially those without appropriate treatment would expose the public in danger of infection.
32443202,In particular, under the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic context in China, it is of great significance to reduce the health risks to the public and environment.
32443202,In this study, technologies of different types of hospital wastes and wastewater disinfection have been summarized.
32443202,Liquid chlorine, sodium hypochlorite, chlorine dioxide, ozone, and ultraviolet irradiation disinfection are commonly used for hospital wastewater disinfection.
32443202,While incineration, chemical disinfection, and physical disinfection are commonly used for hospital wastes disinfection.
32443202,In addition, considering the characteristics of various hospital wastes, the classification and selection of corresponding disinfection technologies are discussed.
32443202,On this basis, this study provides scientific suggestions for management, technology selection, and operation of hospital wastes and wastewater disinfection in China, which is of great significance for development of national disinfection strategy for hospital wastes and wastewater during COVID-19 pandemic.
32443345,Since the end of 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has affected more than 1,000,000 population in the world.
32443345,Subcutaneous emphysema and pneumothorax are uncommon complications of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.
32443345,Herein, we describe a fatal case of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia with subcutaneous emphysema and pneumothorax.
32443345,Subcutaneous emphysema was found in neck, bilateral chest walls, abdomen wall, groin area, and scrotum of a 67-year-old man.
32443345,Extensive air-space opacities, subcutaneous emphysema and a small amount of pneumothorax were found in his chest X-ray scan.
32443345,Echocardiography showed left ventricular enlargement with ejection fraction 20%.
32443345,This resident of Wuhan with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection had chronic pulmonary and cardiac diseases.
32443345,Liver dysfunction, myocardial injury, and coagulation disorder were suggested by laboratory findings.
32443345,Pneumonia, subcutaneous emphysema, and pneumothorax were confirmed with chest X-ray.
32443345,Heart failure was revealed by echocardiography.
32443345,He was transferred to intensive care unit, where invasive ventilation was used for him during the whole hospitalization.
32443345,Prone position ventilation, vasoconstrictor, antibacteria, and antiviral therapy were given.
32443345,He died on the twelfth day after admission.
32443345,Subcutaneous emphysema and pneumothorax may occur in patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and chronic pulmonary disease.
32443345,Chronic cardiac disease might be aggravated by SARS-CoV-2 infection, and develop heart failure.
32443442,The evolving dynamics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the increasing infection numbers require diagnostic tools to identify patients at high risk for a severe disease course.
32443442,Here we evaluate clinical and imaging parameters for estimating the need of intensive care unit (ICU) treatment.
32443442,We collected clinical, laboratory and imaging data from 65 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing.
32443442,Two radiologists evaluated the severity of findings in computed tomography (CT) images on a scale from 1 (no characteristic signs of COVID-19) to 5 (confluent ground glass opacities in over 50% of the lung parenchyma).
32443442,The volume of affected lung was quantified using commercially available software.
32443442,Machine learning modelling was performed to estimate the risk for ICU treatment.
32443442,Patients with a severe course of COVID-19 had significantly increased interleukin (IL)-6, C-reactive protein (CRP), and leukocyte counts and significantly decreased lymphocyte counts.
32443442,The radiological severity grading was significantly increased in ICU patients.
32443442,Multivariate random forest modelling showed a mean ± standard deviation sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 0.72 ± 0.1, 0.86 ± 0.16 and 0.80 ± 0.1 and a receiver operating characteristic-area under curve (ROC-AUC) of 0.79 ± 0.1.
32443442,The need for ICU treatment is independently associated with affected lung volume, radiological severity score, CRP, and IL-6.
32443911,The COVID-19 global pandemic is caused by SARS-CoV-2, and represents an urgent medical and social issue.
32443911,Unfortunately, there is still not a single proven effective drug available, and therefore, current therapeutic guidelines recommend supportive care including oxygen administration and treatment with antibiotics.
32443911,Recently, patients have been also treated with off-label therapies which comprise antiretrovirals, anti-inflammatory compounds, antiparasitic agents and plasma from convalescent patients, all with controversial results.
32443911,The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is important for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis, and plays a pivotal role in viral replication processes.
32443911,In this review, we discuss several aspects of the UPS and the effects of its inhibition with particular regard to the life cycle of the coronaviruses (CoVs).
32443911,In fact, proteasome inhibition by various chemical compounds, such as MG132, epoxomycin and bortezomib, may reduce the virus entry into the eucariotic cell, the synthesis of RNA, and the subsequent protein expression necessary for CoVs.
32443911,Importantly, since UPS inhibitors reduce the cytokine storm associated with various inflammatory conditions, it is reasonable to assume that they might be repurposed for SARS-CoV-2, thus providing an additional tool to counteract both virus replication as well as its most deleterious consequences triggered by abnormal immunological response.
32444382,Due to the urgent need of a therapeutic treatment for coronavirus (CoV) disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, a number of FDA-approved/repurposed drugs have been suggested as antiviral candidates at clinics, without sufficient information.
32444382,Furthermore, there have been extensive debates over antiviral candidates for their effectiveness and safety against severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV 2 (SARS-CoV-2), suggesting that rapid preclinical animal studies are required to identify potential antiviral candidates for human trials.
32444382,To this end, the antiviral efficacies of lopinavir-ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine sulfate, and emtricitabine-tenofovir for SARS-CoV-2 infection were assessed in the ferret infection model.
32444382,While the lopinavir-ritonavir-, hydroxychloroquine sulfate-, or emtricitabine-tenofovir-treated group exhibited lower overall clinical scores than the phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-treated control group, the virus titers in nasal washes, stool specimens, and respiratory tissues were similar between all three antiviral-candidate-treated groups and the PBS-treated control group.
32444382,Only the emtricitabine-tenofovir-treated group showed lower virus titers in nasal washes at 8 days postinfection (dpi) than the PBS-treated control group.
32444382,To further explore the effect of immune suppression on viral infection and clinical outcome, ferrets were treated with azathioprine, an immunosuppressive drug.
32444382,Compared to the PBS-treated control group, azathioprine-immunosuppressed ferrets exhibited a longer period of clinical illness, higher virus titers in nasal turbinate, delayed virus clearance, and significantly lower serum neutralization (SN) antibody titers.
32444382,Taken together, all antiviral drugs tested marginally reduced the overall clinical scores of infected ferrets but did not significantly affect <i>in vivo</i> virus titers.
32444382,Despite the potential discrepancy of drug efficacies between animals and humans, these preclinical ferret data should be highly informative to future therapeutic treatment of COVID-19 patients.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic continues to spread worldwide, with rapidly increasing numbers of mortalities, placing increasing strain on health care systems.
32444382,Despite serious public health concerns, no effective vaccines or therapeutics have been approved by regulatory agencies.
32444382,In this study, we tested the FDA-approved drugs lopinavir-ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine sulfate, and emtricitabine-tenofovir against SARS-CoV-2 infection in a highly susceptible ferret infection model.
32444382,While most of the drug treatments marginally reduced clinical symptoms, they did not reduce virus titers, with the exception of emtricitabine-tenofovir treatment, which led to diminished virus titers in nasal washes at 8 dpi.
32444382,Further, the azathioprine-treated immunosuppressed ferrets showed delayed virus clearance and low SN titers, resulting in a prolonged infection.
32444382,As several FDA-approved or repurposed drugs are being tested as antiviral candidates at clinics without sufficient information, rapid preclinical animal studies should proceed to identify therapeutic drug candidates with strong antiviral potential and high safety prior to a human efficacy trial.
32444393,Previous reports on the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 were on the basis of data from the general population.
32444393,Our study aimed to investigate the clinical features of patients on maintenance hemodialysis.
32444393,In this retrospective, single-center study, we included 49 hospitalized patients on maintenance hemodialysis and 52 hospitalized patients without kidney failure (controls) with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 at Tongren Hospital of Wuhan University from January 30, 2020 to March 10, 2020.
32444393,Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiologic characteristics and treatment and outcomes data were analyzed.
32444393,The final date of follow-up was March 19, 2020.
32444393,The median age of 101 patients was 62 years (interquartile range, 49-72).
32444393,All patients were local residents of Wuhan.
32444393,In terms of common symptoms, there were differences between patients on hemodialysis and controls (fatigue [59% versus 83%], dry cough [49% versus 71%], and fever [47% versus 90%]).
32444393,Lymphocyte counts were decreased (0.8×10<sup>9</sup>/L [patients on hemodialysis] versus 0.9×10<sup>9</sup>/L [controls], <i>P=</i>0.02).
32444393,Comparing patients on hemodialysis with controls, creatine kinase-muscle and brain type, myoglobin, hypersensitive troponin I, B-type natriuretic peptide, and procalcitonin were increased, and the percentage of abnormalities in bilateral lung was higher in computed tomographic scan (82% versus 69%, <i>P</i>=0.15) and unilateral lung was lower (10% versus 27%, <i>P=</i>0.03).
32444393,Common complications including shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, arrhythmia, and acute cardiac injury in patients on hemodialysis were significantly higher.
32444393,Compared with controls, more patients on hemodialysis received noninvasive ventilation (25% versus 6%, <i>P</i>=0.008).
32444393,As of March 19, 2020, three patients on hemodialysis (6%) were transferred to the intensive care unit and received invasive ventilation.
32444393,Seven patients on hemodialysis (14%) had died.
32444393,The main symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia, including fever and cough, were less common in patients on hemodialysis.
32444393,Patients on hemodialysis with coronavirus disease 2019 were at higher risk of death.
32444415,The clinical features of rheumatic patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have not been reported.
32444415,This study aimed to describe the clinical features of COVID-19 in rheumatic patients and provide information for handling this situation in clinical practice.
32444415,This is a retrospective case series study.
32444415,Deidentified data, including gender, age, laboratory and radiological results, symptoms, signs, and medication history, were collected from 2326 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, including 21 cases in combination with rheumatic disease, in Tongji Hospital between 13 January and 15 March 2020.
32444415,Length of hospital stay and mortality rate were similar between rheumatic and non-rheumatic groups, while the presence of respiratory failure was more common in rheumatic cases (38% vs 10%, p&lt;0.001).
32444415,Symptoms of fever, fatigue and diarrhoea were seen in 76%, 43% and 23% of patients, respectively.
32444415,There were four rheumatic patients who experienced a flare of rheumatic disease during hospital stay, with symptoms of muscle aches, back pain, joint pain or rash.
32444415,While lymphocytopaenia was seen in 57% of rheumatic patients, only one patient (5%) presented with leucopenia in rheumatic cases.
32444415,Rheumatic patients presented with similar radiological features of ground-glass opacity and consolidation.
32444415,Patients with pre-existing interstitial lung disease showed massive fibrous stripes and crazy-paving signs at an early stage.
32444415,Five rheumatic cases used hydroxychloroquine before the diagnosis of COVID-19 and none progressed to critically ill stage.
32444415,Respiratory failure was more common in rheumatic patients infected with COVID-19.
32444415,Differential diagnosis between COVID-19 and a flare of rheumatic disease should be considered.

32444460,To characterise the clinical features of patients admitted to hospital with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) in the United Kingdom during the growth phase of the first wave of this outbreak who were enrolled in the International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infections Consortium (ISARIC) World Health Organization (WHO) Clinical Characterisation Protocol UK (CCP-UK) study, and to explore risk factors associated with mortality in hospital.
32444460,Prospective observational cohort study with rapid data gathering and near real time analysis. 208 acute care hospitals in England, Wales, and Scotland between 6 February and 19 April 2020.
32444460,A case report form developed by ISARIC and WHO was used to collect clinical data.
32444460,A minimal follow-up time of two weeks (to 3 May 2020) allowed most patients to complete their hospital admission. 20 133 hospital inpatients with covid-19.
32444460,Admission to critical care (high dependency unit or intensive care unit) and mortality in hospital.
32444460,The median age of patients admitted to hospital with covid-19, or with a diagnosis of covid-19 made in hospital, was 73 years (interquartile range 58-82, range 0-104).
32444460,More men were admitted than women (men 60%, n=12 068; women 40%, n=8065).
32444460,The median duration of symptoms before admission was 4 days (interquartile range 1-8).
32444460,The commonest comorbidities were chronic cardiac disease (31%, 5469/17 702), uncomplicated diabetes (21%, 3650/17 599), non-asthmatic chronic pulmonary disease (18%, 3128/17 634), and chronic kidney disease (16%, 2830/17 506); 23% (4161/18 525) had no reported major comorbidity.
32444460,Overall, 41% (8199/20 133) of patients were discharged alive, 26% (5165/20 133) died, and 34% (6769/20 133) continued to receive care at the reporting date. 17% (3001/18 183) required admission to high dependency or intensive care units; of these, 28% (826/3001) were discharged alive, 32% (958/3001) died, and 41% (1217/3001) continued to receive care at the reporting date.
32444460,Of those receiving mechanical ventilation, 17% (276/1658) were discharged alive, 37% (618/1658) died, and 46% (764/1658) remained in hospital.
32444460,Increasing age, male sex, and comorbidities including chronic cardiac disease, non-asthmatic chronic pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, liver disease and obesity were associated with higher mortality in hospital.
32444460,ISARIC WHO CCP-UK is a large prospective cohort study of patients in hospital with covid-19.
32444460,The study continues to enrol at the time of this report.
32444460,In study participants, mortality was high, independent risk factors were increasing age, male sex, and chronic comorbidity, including obesity.
32444460,This study has shown the importance of pandemic preparedness and the need to maintain readiness to launch research studies in response to outbreaks.

32444482,The safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma in severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remain uncertain.
32444482,To support a guideline on COVID-19 management, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of convalescent plasma in COVID-19 and other severe respiratory viral infections.
32444482,In March 2020, we searched international and Chinese biomedical literature databases, clinical trial registries and prepublication sources for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and nonrandomized studies comparing patients receiving and not receiving convalescent plasma.
32444482,We included patients with acute coronavirus, influenza and Ebola virus infections.
32444482,We conducted a meta-analysis using random-effects models and assessed the quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.
32444482,Of 1099 unique records, 6 studies were eligible, and none of these included patients with COVID-19.
32444482,One nonrandomized study (<i>n</i> = 40) on convalescent plasma in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) provided uninformative results regarding mortality (relative risk [RR] 0.10, 95% confidence interval [CI] CI 0.01 to 1.70).
32444482,Pooled estimates from 4 RCTs on influenza (<i>n</i> = 572) showed no convincing effects on deaths (4 RCTs, RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.81), complete recovery (2 RCTs, odds ratio 1.04, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.64) or length of stay (3 RCTs, mean difference -1.62, 95% CI -3.82 to 0.58, d).
32444482,The quality of evidence was very low for all efficacy outcomes.
32444482,Convalescent plasma caused few or no serious adverse events in influenza RCTs (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.29, low-quality evidence).
32444482,Studies of non- COVID-19 severe respiratory viral infections provide indirect, very low-quality evidence that raises the possibility that convalescent plasma has minimal or no benefit in the treatment of COVID-19 and low-quality evidence that it does not cause serious adverse events.
32444493,To report clinical and laboratory characteristics, as well as treatment and clinical outcomes of patients admitted for neurologic diseases with and without COVID-19.
32444493,In this retrospective, single center cohort study, we included all adult inpatients with confirmed COVID-19, admitted to a Neuro-COVID Unit from February 21, 2020, who had been discharged or died by April 5, 2020.
32444493,Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data were extracted from medical records and compared (FDR-corrected) to those of neurologic patients without COVID-19 admitted in the same period.
32444493,One hundred seventy-three patients were included in this study, of whom 56 were positive for COVID-19 while 117 were negative for COVID-19.
32444493,Patients with COVID-19 were older (77.0, IQR 67.0-83.8 vs 70.1, IQR 52.9-78.6, <i>p</i> = 0.006), had a different distribution regarding admission diagnoses, including cerebrovascular disorders (n = 43, 76.8% vs n = 68, 58.1%), and had a higher quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score on admission (0.5, IQR 0.4-0.6 vs 0.9, IQR 0.7-1.1, <i>p</i> = 0.006).
32444493,In-hospital mortality rates (n = 21, 37.5% vs n = 5, 4.3%, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and incident delirium (n = 15, 26.8% vs n = 9, 7.7%, <i>p</i> = 0.003) were significantly higher in the COVID-19 group.
32444493,COVID-19 and non-COVID patients with stroke had similar baseline characteristics but patients with COVID-19 had higher modified Rankin scale scores at discharge (5.0, IQR 2.0-6.0 vs 2.0, IQR 1.0-3.0, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), with a significantly lower number of patients with a good outcome (n = 11, 25.6% vs n = 48, 70.6%, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001).
32444493,In patients with COVID-19, multivariable regressions showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with higher qSOFA scores (OR 4.47, 95% CI 1.21-16.5; <i>p</i> = 0.025), lower platelet count (0.98, 0.97-0.99; <i>p</i> = 0.005) and higher lactate dehydrogenase (1.01, 1.00-1.03; <i>p</i> = 0.009) on admission.
32444493,COVID-19 patients admitted with neurologic disease, including stroke, have a significantly higher in-hospital mortality, incident delirium and higher disability than patients without COVID-19.
32444504,Ischaemic heart disease (IHD), in particular acute coronary syndrome (ACS), comprising ST-elevation myocardial infarction, non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction and unstable angina, is the leading cause of death worldwide.
32444504,Age is a major predictor of adverse outcome following ACS.
32444504,COVID-19 infection seems to escalate the risk in older patients with heart disease.
32444504,Increasing odds of in-hospital death is associated with older age following COVID-19 infection.
32444504,Importantly, it seems older patients with comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), in particular IHD, diabetes and hypertension, are at the highest risk of mortality following COVID-19 infection.
32444504,The evidence is sparse on the optimal care of older patients with ACS with lack of robust randomised controlled trials.
32444504,In this setting, with the serious threat imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic in the context of rapidly evolving knowledge with much unknown, it is important to weigh the risks and benefits of treatment strategies offered to older patients.
32444504,In cases where risks outweigh the benefits, it might not be an unreasonable option to treat such patients with a conservative or a palliative approach.
32444504,Further evidence to elucidate whether invasive management is beneficial in older patients with ACS is required out-with the COVID-19 pandemic.
32444504,Though it is hoped that the actual acute phase of COVID-19 infection will be short lived, it is vital that important clinical research is continued, given the long-term benefits of ongoing clinical research for patients with long-term conditions, including CVD.
32444504,This review aimed to evaluate the challenges and the management strategies in the care of older patients presenting with ACS in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.
32444743,The COVID-19 disruption to 'business as usual' presents an opportunity for a profound change in oral healthcare experience for our patients and our profession.
32444743,While the prospect of change has dominated professional dialogue for years, the post-COVID-19 era offers choices with respect to pace, proximity, preparedness, protection and equity.
32444743,There is potential for a determined revision of the current activity-driven clinical approach, with the adoption of the minimally invasive oral care philosophy into routine practice and use of technology to remotely support our patients.
32444743,Throughout COVID-19, the whole of the dental profession has demonstrated adaptability in redeployment and compassion in delivering care in a variety of settings.
32444743,These vital traits and bold clinical leadership, prepared to make timely choices and act fast, will underpin our successful transition towards the safe resumption of routine dental services.
32444743,In making the right choices, we have at hand a future integrated dental team care model with time to concentrate on personalised prevention advice, as well as the provision of effective, highly skilled treatment.
32444797,During the COVID-19 pandemic, the European biobanking infrastructure is in a unique position to preserve valuable biological material complemented with detailed data for future research purposes.
32444797,Biobanks can be either integrated into healthcare, where preservation of the biological material is a fork in clinical routine diagnostics and medical treatment processes or they can also host prospective cohorts or material related to clinical trials.
32444797,The paper discussed objectives of BBMRI-ERIC, the European research infrastructure established to facilitate access to quality-defined biological materials and data for research purposes, with respect to the COVID-19 crisis: (a) to collect information on available European as well as non-European COVID-19-relevant biobanking resources in BBMRI-ERIC Directory and to facilitate access to these via BBMRI-ERIC Negotiator platform; (b) to help harmonizing guidelines on how data and biological material is to be collected to maximize utility for future research, including large-scale data processing in artificial intelligence, by participating in activities such as COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative; (c) to minimize risks for all involved parties dealing with (potentially) infectious material by developing recommendations and guidelines; (d) to provide a European-wide platform of exchange in relation to ethical, legal, and societal issues (ELSI) specific to the collection of biological material and data during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32444866,Patients with multiple myeloma (MM) seem to be at increased risk for more severe COVID-19 infection and associated complications due to their immunocompromised state, the older age and comorbidities.
32444866,The European Myeloma Network has provided an expert consensus statement in order to guide therapeutic decisions in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic.
32444866,Patient education for personal hygiene and social distancing measures, along with treatment individualization, telemedicine and continuous surveillance for early diagnosis of COVID-19 are essential.
32444866,In countries or local communities where COVID-19 infection is widely spread, MM patients should have a PCR test of nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 before hospital admission, starting a new treatment line, cell apheresis or ASCT in order to avoid ward or community spread and infections.
32444866,Oral agent-based regimens should be considered, especially for the elderly and frail patients with standard risk disease, whereas de-intensified regimens for dexamethasone, bortezomib, carfilzomib and daratumumab should be used based on patient risk and response.
32444866,Treatment initiation should not be postponed for patients with end organ damage, myeloma emergencies and aggressive relapses.
32444866,Autologous (and especially allogeneic) transplantation should be delayed and extended induction should be administered, especially in standard risk patients and those with adequate MM response to induction.
32444866,Watchful waiting should be considered for standard risk relapsed patients with low tumor burden, and slow biochemical relapses.
32444866,The conduction of clinical trials should continue with appropriate adaptations to the current circumstances.
32444866,Patients with MM and symptomatic COVID-19 disease should interrupt anti-myeloma treatment until recovery.
32444866,For patients with positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2, but with no symptoms for COVID-19, a 14-day quarantine should be considered if myeloma-related events allow the delay of treatment.
32444866,The need for surveillance for drug interactions due to polypharmacy is highlighted.
32444866,The participation in international COVID-19 cancer registries is greatly encouraged.
32445030,The review aims to provide a summary of the current literature regarding common medications prescribed in orthopaedic surgery and their potential implications in COVID-19 patients.
32445030,A systematic review was performed using the PRISMA guidelines.
32445030,All clinical studies, reviews, consensus and guidelines related to the above medications and COVID-19 were included.
32445030,A total of 18 articles were included.
32445030,The use of analgesia, anti-inflammatories, steroids, anticoagulants, antibiotics, vitamin B, vitamin C and vitamin D and their potential impact on COVID-19 patients were reported.
32445030,Eight main recommendations were derived from the review.
32445030,Firstly, paracetamol remains the first line of analgesia and antipyretic.
32445030,Secondly, there is no need to avoid NSAIDs for COVID-19 patients.
32445030,Thirdly, opioids have the potential for immunosuppression in addition to respiratory depression and, therefore, should be prescribed with care in COVID-19 patients.
32445030,Fourthly, patients with conditions where steroids are proven to be efficacious can continue to receive their steroids; otherwise, systemic steroids are not recommended for COVID-19 patients.
32445030,Fifthly, orthopaedic surgeons following up on COVID-19 patients who are using steroids should continue to follow them up for possible avascular necrosis.
32445030,Sixthly, whenever possible, oral anticoagulation should be converted to parental heparin.
32445030,Seventhly, common orthopaedic antibiotics including penicillin and clindamycin are safe to continue for COVID-19 patients.
32445030,However, for COVID-19 patients, the antibiotics can potentially be switched to macrolides and tetracyclines if the organisms are sensitive.
32445030,Lastly, prescription for vitamins B, C and D should continue as per usual clinical practice.
32445083,The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) outbreak is having a profound impact on the management of patients with cancer.
32445083,In this review, we comprehensively investigate the various aspects of cancer care during the pandemic, taking advantage of data generated in Asia and Europe at the frontline of the COVID-19 pandemic spread.
32445083,Cancer wards have been subjected to several modifications to protect patients and healthcare professionals from COVID-19 infection, while attempting to maintain cancer diagnosis, therapy, and research.
32445083,In this setting, the management of COVID-19 infected patients with cancer is particularly challenging.
32445083,We also discuss the direct and potential remote impacts of the global pandemic on the mortality of patients with cancer.
32445083,As such, the indirect impact of the pandemic on the global economy and the potential consequences in terms of cancer mortality are discussed.
32445083,As the infection is spreading worldwide, we are obtaining more knowledge on the COVID-19 pandemic consequences that are currently impacting and may continue to further challenge cancer care in several countries.
32445105,As the COVID-19 pandemic developed, reports of neurological dysfunctions spanning the central and peripheral nervous systems have emerged.
32445105,The spectrum of acute neurological dysfunctions may implicate direct viral invasion, para-infectious complications, neurological manifestations of systemic diseases, or co-incident neurological dysfunction in the context of high SARS-CoV-2 prevalence.
32445105,A rapid and pragmatic approach to understanding the prevalence, phenotypes, pathophysiology and prognostic implications of COVID-19 neurological syndromes is urgently needed.
32445105,The Global Consortium to Study Neurological dysfunction in COVID-19 (GCS-NeuroCOVID), endorsed by the Neurocritical Care Society (NCS), was rapidly established to address this need in a tiered approach.
32445105,Tier-1 consists of focused, pragmatic, low-cost, observational common data element (CDE) collection, which can be launched immediately at many sites in the first phase of this pandemic and is designed for expedited ethical board review with waiver-of-consent.
32445105,Tier 2 consists of prospective functional and cognitive outcomes assessments with more detailed clinical, laboratory and radiographic data collection that would require informed consent.
32445105,Tier 3 overlays Tiers 1 and 2 with experimental molecular, electrophysiology, pathology and imaging studies with longitudinal outcomes assessment and would require centers with specific resources.
32445105,A multicenter pediatrics core has developed and launched a parallel study focusing on patients ages &lt;18 years.
32445105,Study sites are eligible for participation if they provide clinical care to COVID-19 patients and are able to conduct patient-oriented research under approval of an internal or global ethics committee.
32445105,Hospitalized pediatric and adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 and with acute neurological signs or symptoms are eligible to participate.
32445105,The primary study outcome is the overall prevalence of neurological complications among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, which will be calculated by pooled estimates of each neurological finding divided by the average census of COVID-19 positive patients over the study period.
32445105,Secondary outcomes include: in-hospital, 30 and 90-day morality, discharge modified Rankin score, ventilator-free survival, ventilator days, discharge disposition, and hospital length of stay.
32445105,In a one-month period (3/27/20-4/27/20) the GCS-NeuroCOVID consortium was able to recruit 71 adult study sites, representing 17 countries and 5 continents and 34 pediatrics study sites.
32445105,This is one of the first large-scale global research collaboratives urgently assembled to evaluate acute neurological events in the context of a pandemic.
32445105,The innovative and pragmatic tiered study approach has allowed for rapid recruitment and activation of numerous sites across the world-an approach essential to capture real-time critical neurological data to inform treatment strategies in this pandemic crisis.
32445195,COVID-19 has created unprecedented challenges for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) clinical care and research in the United States.
32445195,Traditional evaluations for making an ALS diagnosis, measuring progression, and planning interventions rely on in-person visits that may now be unsafe or impossible.
32445195,Evidence- and experience-based treatment options such as multidisciplinary team care, feeding tubes, wheelchairs, home health and hospice have become more difficult to obtain and in some places are unavailable.
32445195,Additionally, the pandemic has impacted ALS clinical trials by impairing the ability to obtain measurements for trial eligibility, to monitor safety and efficacy outcomes, and to dispense study drug since these also often rely on in-person visits.
32445195,We review opportunities for overcoming some of these challenges through telemedicine and novel measurements.
32445195,These can re-optimize ALS care and research in the current setting and during future events that may limit travel and face to face interactions.

32445204,The Child Neurology Society collaborated with the Pediatric Epilepsy Research Consortium to issue an online statement April 6, 2020 of immediate recommendations to streamline diagnosis, treatment, and follow up of infantile spasms.
32445204,The recommendations encourage use of telemedicine, outpatient over inpatient studies, and oral therapies as initial treatment.
32445204,Each recommendation is earmarked as enduring if intended to outlast the pandemic, and limited if intended only during the duration of the pandemic.

32445315,The Corona Virus Disease-2019 (COVID-19), one of the most devastating pandemics ever, has left thousands of cancer patients to their fate.
32445315,The future course of this pandemic is still an enigma, but health care services are expected to resume soon in a phased manner.
32445315,This might be a long drawn process and we need to have policies in place, to be able to fight both, the SARS-CoV-2 virus and cancer, simultaneously, and emerge triumphant.
32445315,An extensive literature search for impact of delay in management of various urological malignancies was carried out.
32445315,Expert opinions were sought wherever there was paucity of evidence, in order to reach a consensus and come up with recommendations for directing uro-oncology services in the times of COVID-19.
32445315,The panel recommends deferring treatment of patients with renal cell carcinoma by 3 to 6 months, except for those with ongoing hematuria and/or inferior vena cava thrombus, which warrant immediate surgery.
32445315,Metastatic renal cell cancers should be started on targeted therapy.
32445315,Low grade non-muscle invasive bladder cancers can be kept on active surveillance while high risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancers and muscle invasive bladder cancers should be treated within 3 months.
32445315,Neoadjuvant chemotherapy should be avoided.
32445315,Management of low and intermediate risk prostate cancer can be deferred for 3 to 6months while high risk prostate cancer patients can be initiated on neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy.
32445315,Patients with testicular tumors should undergo high inguinal orchiectomy and be treated according to stage without delay, with stage I patients being offered surveillance.
32445315,Penile cancers should undergo penectomy, while clinically negative groins can be kept on surveillance.
32445315,Neoadjuvant chemotherapy should be avoided and adjuvant therapy should be deferred.
32445315,We need to tailor our treatment strategies to the prevailing present conditions, so as to fight and defeat both, the SARS-CoV-2 virus and cancer.
32445315,Protection of health care workers, judicious use of available resources, and a rational and balanced outlook towards different malignancies is the need of the hour.
32445330,The practice of radiation oncology requires stringent adherence to specific steps and principles designed to minimize exposure of an individual to unnecessary doses of radiation.
32445330,The basic principles of such measures to reduce the risk of exposure and limit the doses of irradiation follow the &quot;as low as reasonably achievable &quot; or ALARA principle by using the concepts of time, distance and shielding.
32445330,Potential exposures in radiation oncology are controlled through combination of optimal design and installation of radiation delivery equipment with well-defined standard operating procedures (SOPs).
32445330,In the modern era of viral pandemics, similar principles can also be applied toward prevention of viral transmission and protection of populations at risk.
32445330,In the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the probability of an individual getting infected is dependent on the viral load that an individual is exposed to in public spaces over a period of time.
32445330,All prevention and control measures are based on preventing any such exposure to the virus, that can be achieved through limiting space for movement of the virus, using barriers and increasing distance to vulnerable surfaces, and limiting the duration of exposure.
32445330,Apart from adhering to the laid-down provisions of a lock-down, preventive measures recommended for the general public include maintaining hand-hygiene, social distancing, and using facemasks to break the chain of transmission.
32445330,Appropriate triage and customization of treatment protocols can help curtail hospital visits and time-spent by cancer patients during pandemic times, thereby reducing their risk of exposure as well as allowing efficient utilization of resources.
32445330,The outbreak of the contagious COVID-19 pandemic threatens to disrupt healthcare systems globally with its unprecedented challenges.
32445330,However, despite all the difficulties and hardships, it has also enabled new ways of learning and communication, which are likely to persist even in the post-COVID world.
32445440,Although several therapeutic agents have been evaluated for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), none have yet been shown to be efficacious.
32445440,We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of intravenous remdesivir in adults hospitalized with Covid-19 with evidence of lower respiratory tract involvement.
32445440,Patients were randomly assigned to receive either remdesivir (200 mg loading dose on day 1, followed by 100 mg daily for up to 9 additional days) or placebo for up to 10 days.
32445440,The primary outcome was the time to recovery, defined by either discharge from the hospital or hospitalization for infection-control purposes only.
32445440,A total of 1063 patients underwent randomization.
32445440,The data and safety monitoring board recommended early unblinding of the results on the basis of findings from an analysis that showed shortened time to recovery in the remdesivir group.
32445440,Preliminary results from the 1059 patients (538 assigned to remdesivir and 521 to placebo) with data available after randomization indicated that those who received remdesivir had a median recovery time of 11 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 9 to 12), as compared with 15 days (95% CI, 13 to 19) in those who received placebo (rate ratio for recovery, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.55; P&lt;0.001).
32445440,The Kaplan-Meier estimates of mortality by 14 days were 7.1% with remdesivir and 11.9% with placebo (hazard ratio for death, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.47 to 1.04).
32445440,Serious adverse events were reported for 114 of the 541 patients in the remdesivir group who underwent randomization (21.1%) and 141 of the 522 patients in the placebo group who underwent randomization (27.0%).
32445440,Remdesivir was superior to placebo in shortening the time to recovery in adults hospitalized with Covid-19 and evidence of lower respiratory tract infection.
32445440,(Funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and others; ACCT-1 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04280705.).
32445484,The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and associated COVID-19 disease are straining healthcare systems around the world with large numbers of patients becoming ill in a very short period of time, overwhelming healthcare systems in many countries.
32445484,Several drugs are being repurposed into clinical trials in COVID-19 patients, ranging from drugs already well established in other diseases, such as chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir+ ritonavir, azithromycin and tocilizumab/sarilumab, to those such as remdesivir still in development for their initial indication (1).
32445484,The opportunities for clinical pharmacology to contribute to the development of new treatments have already been described by others in Clinical Pharmacology &amp; Therapeutics (2).
32445580,In December 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) broke out in Wuhan.
32445580,Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported, but the relationships between laboratory features and viral load has not been comprehensively described.
32445580,Adult inpatients (≥18 years old) with COVID-19 who underwent multiple (≥ 5 times) nucleic acid tests with nasal and pharyngeal swabs were recruited from Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, including general patients (n=70), severe patients (n=195) and critical patients (n=43).
32445580,Laboratory data, demographic and clinical data were extracted from electronic medical records.
32445580,The fitted polynomial curve was used to explore the association between serial viral loads and illness severity.
32445580,Viral load of SARS-CoV-2 peaked within the first few days (2-4 days) after admission, then decreased rapidly along with virus rebound under treatment.
32445580,Critical patients had the highest viral loads, in contrast to the general patients showing the lowest viral loads.
32445580,The viral loads were higher in sputum compared with nasal and pharyngeal swab (p=0.026).
32445580,The positive rate of respiratory tract samples was significantly higher than that of gastrointestinal tract samples (p&lt;0.001).
32445580,The SARS-CoV-2 viral load was negatively correlated with portion parameters of blood routine and lymphocyte subsets, and was positively associated with laboratory features of cardiovascular system.
32445580,The serial viral loads of patients revealed whole viral shedding during hospitalization and the resurgence of virus during the treatment, which could be used for early warning of illness severity, thus improve antiviral interventions.
32445881,The spread of COVID-19 is accelerating.
32445881,At present, there is no specific antiviral drugs for COVID-19 outbreak.
32445881,This is a multicenter retrospective cohort study of patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection pneumonia from 3 hospitals in Hubei and Guangdong province, 141 adults (aged ≥18 years) without ventilation were included.
32445881,Combined group patients were given Arbidol and IFN-α2b, monotherapy group patients inhaled IFN-α2b for 10-14 days.
32445881,Of 141 COVID-19 patients, baseline clinical and laboratory characteristics were similar between combined group and monotherapy group, that 30% of the patients leucocytes counts were below the normal range and 36.4% of the patients experienced lymphocytopenia.
32445881,The duration of viral RNA of respiratory tract in the monotherapy group was not longer than that in the combined therapy group.
32445881,There was no significant differences between two groups.
32445881,The absorption of pneumonia in the combined group was faster than that in the monotherapy group.
32445881,We inferred that Arbidol/IFN - 2b therapy can be used as an effective method to improve the COVID-19 pneumonia of mild patients, although it helpless with accelerating the virus clearance.
32445881,These results should be verified in a larger prospective randomized environment.
32445904,Delirium is a common symptom in patients admitted to our hospital with COVID-19, and in cases of hyperactive delirium we have frequently observed behaviors that pose a significant risk of disease transmission to health care providers.
32445904,Managing this symptom has emerged as an important challenge, as our local health care system has been strained by providers becoming sick or quarantined.
32445904,Preventative and non-pharmacologic interventions remain critical for managing delirium in such patients, though occasionally pharmacologic treatment is required.
32445904,When use of an antipsychotic medication is indicated, we recommend that providers consider foregoing the lowest common dose and instead start with the next incrementally higher dose to more quickly and reliably ensure the safety of both patients and providers.
32445904,We do not recommend initiating prophylactic treatment or escalating doses in a manner that conflicts with currently accepted guidelines without carefully considering the risks and benefits.
32445924,The morbidity of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is reaching 3 Million landmark causing and a serious public health concern globally and it is enigmatic how several antiviral and antibody treatments were not effective in the different period across the globe.
32445924,With the drastic increasing number of positive cases around the world WHO raised the importance in the assessment of the risk of spread and understanding genetic modifications that could have occurred in the SARS-CoV-2.
32445924,Using all available deep sequencing data of complete genome from all over the world (NCBI repository), we identified several hundreds of point mutations or SNPs in SARS-CoV-2 all across the genome.
32445924,This could be the cause for the constant change and differed virulence with an increase in mortality and morbidity.
32445924,Among the 12 different countries (one sequence from each country) with complete genome sequencing data, we noted the 47 key point mutations or SNPs located along the entire genome that might have impact in the virulence and response to different antivirals against SARS-CoV-2.
32445924,In this regard, key viral proteins of spike glycoprotein, Nsp1, RdRp and the ORF8 region got heavily mutated within these 3 months via person-to-person passage.
32445924,We also discuss what could be the possible cause of this rapid mutation in the SARS-CoV-2.
32445935,The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease 2019 (COVID-19) among adult patients treated with biologic agents or small molecules for chronic inflammatory rheumatic diseases, in particular chronic inflammatory arthritides.
32445935,To this end, a population-based study, in the province of Udine (466,700 inhabitants, with age &gt; 15 years old, Friuli Venezia Giulia region, Italy) was planned.
32445935,The primary outcome was the prevalence of COVID-19 in the first two months of the outbreak.
32445935,All the rheumatic patients treated with biologic agents or small molecules in the last 6 months in our province were included (N=1051).
32445935,From February 29 to April 25, 2020, 4 adult patients (4/1051, i.e.
32445935,3.8/1000, 95% Confidence Interval 1.5-9.7/1000) were registered as swab test positive by PCR for COVID-19.
32445935,Overall, a total of 47/1051 (4,5%) cases were tested for COVID-19 by PCR in the same period, and 15 of them due to symptoms compatible with COVID-19.
32445935,In the general population, the prevalence was 937 cases/466700 (2/1000, 95% Confidence Interval 1.9-2.1/1000, p value=0.33, chi square test), and 20,179/466,700 (4.3%) swab tests for COVID-19 were performed..
32445935,The risk of COVID-19 in rheumatic patients under biologic agents or small molecules does not appear different from that observed in the general population.
32445935,Patients should be informed to safely proceed with their treatment and follow the rules for self-protection to COVID-19.
32445956,The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been declared as a global pandemic, but specific medicines and vaccines are still being developed.
32445956,In China, interventional therapies with traditional Chinese medicine for COVID-19 have achieved significant clinical efficacies, but the underlying pharmacological mechanisms are still unclear.
32445956,This article reviewed the etiology of COVID-19 and clinical efficacy.
32445956,Both network pharmacological study and literature search were used to demonstrate the possible action mechanisms of Chinese medicines in treating COVID-19.
32445956,We found that Chinese medicines played the role of antivirus, anti-inflammation and immunoregulation, and target organs protection in the management of COVID-19 by multiple components acting on multiple targets at multiple pathways.
32445956,AEC2 and 3CL protein could be the direct targets for inhibiting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32445956,Quercetin, kaempferol, luteolin, isorhamnetin, baicalein, naringenin, and wogonin could be the main active ingredients of Chinese medicines for the management of COVID-19 by targeting on AEC2 and 3CL protein and inhibiting inflammatory mediators, regulating immunity, and eliminating free radicals through COX-2, CASP3, IL-6, MAPK1, MAPK14, MAPK8, and REAL in the signaling pathways of IL-17, arachidonic acid, HIF-1, NF-κB, Ras, and TNF.
32445956,This study may provide meaningful and useful information on further research to investigate the action mechanisms of Chinese medicines against SARS-CoV-2 and also provide a basis for sharing the &quot;China scheme&quot; for COVID-19 treatment.
32446037,The COVID-19 can cause severe pneumonia and is estimated to have a high impact on the healthcare system.
32446037,Early diagnosis is crucial for correct treatment in order to possibly reduce the stress in the healthcare system.
32446037,The standard image diagnosis tests for pneumonia are chest X-ray (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) scan.
32446037,Although CT scan is the gold standard, CXR are still useful because it is cheaper, faster and more widespread.
32446037,This study aims to identify pneumonia caused by COVID-19 from other types and also healthy lungs using only CXR images.
32446037,In order to achieve the objectives, we have proposed a classification schema considering the following perspectives: i) a multi-class classification; ii) hierarchical classification, since pneumonia can be structured as a hierarchy.
32446037,Given the natural data imbalance in this domain, we also proposed the use of resampling algorithms in the schema in order to re-balance the classes distribution.
32446037,We observed that, texture is one of the main visual attributes of CXR images, our classification schema extract features using some well-known texture descriptors and also using a pre-trained CNN model.
32446037,We also explored early and late fusion techniques in the schema in order to leverage the strength of multiple texture descriptors and base classifiers at once.
32446037,To evaluate the approach, we composed a database, named RYDLS-20, containing CXR images of pneumonia caused by different pathogens as well as CXR images of healthy lungs.
32446037,The classes distribution follows a real-world scenario in which some pathogens are more common than others.
32446037,The proposed approach tested in RYDLS-20 achieved a macro-avg F1-Score of 0.65 using a multi-class approach and a F1-Score of 0.89 for the COVID-19 identification in the hierarchical classification scenario.
32446037,As far as we know, the top identification rate obtained in this paper is the best nominal rate obtained for COVID-19 identification in an unbalanced environment with more than three classes.
32446037,We must also highlight the novel proposed hierarchical classification approach for this task, which considers the types of pneumonia caused by the different pathogens and lead us to the best COVID-19 recognition rate obtained here.
32446167,At present, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread in many countries.
32446167,We conducted this study to help pediatricians understand the conditions of COVID-19 in children.
32446167,We retrospectively summarized the characteristics, treatment and outcomes of pediatric cases in Wuhan Children's Hospital which was the only designated hospital for children with COVID-19 in Hubei Province.
32446167,A Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to evaluate factors associated with clinical outcomes.
32446167,As of February 29, 75 children had been discharged, of which only one was has severe pneumonia and one was critical cases.
32446167,Children younger than 2 years were more susceptible to COVID-19.
32446167,All patients have received interferon-α nebulization, and eight cases including the severe and critical cases were co-administrated ribavirin.
32446167,Five patients with mild pneumonia were given arbidol.
32446167,Twenty-three patients were given traditional Chinese medicine (TCM).
32446167,The average length of stay (LOS) and the time of SARS-CoV-2 clearance were 10.57 and 6.39 days, respectively.
32446167,None of the factors was associated with LOS or time of SARS-CoV-2 clearance.
32446167,The severity of COVID-19 in pediatric cases were milder than adults.
32446167,The efficacy of the antiviral therapy in children with COVID-19 remains to be evaluated.
32446285,The emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 strain of the human coronavirus has thrown the world into the midst of a new pandemic.
32446285,In the human body, the virus causes COVID-19, a disease characterized by shortness of breath, fever, and pneumonia, which can be fatal in vulnerable individuals.
32446285,SARS-CoV-2 has characteristics of past human coronaviruses, with close genomic similarities to SARS-CoV, the virus that causes the disease SARS.
32446285,Like these related coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted through the inhalation of droplets and interaction with contaminated surfaces.
32446285,Across the world, laboratories are developing candidate vaccines for the virus - with vaccine trials underway in the US and the United Kingdom - and considering various drugs for possible treatments and prophylaxis.
32446285,Here, we provide an overview of SARS-CoV-2 by analyzing its virology, epidemiology, and modes of transmission while examining the current progress of testing procedures and possible treatments through drugs and vaccines.
32446311,Efficacy of conventional treatment plus the complementary therapy Liu-zi-jue (a mind-body exercise) to treat patients with mild COVID-19.
32446311,The study is a single-center 2 arm, randomized controlled trial with parallel-group design.
32446312,Metformin was proposed to be a candidate for host-directed therapy for COVID-19.
32446312,However, its efficacy remains to be validated.
32446312,In this study, we compared the outcome of metformin users and nonusers in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with diabetes.
32446312,Hospitalized diabetic patients with confirmed COVID-19 in the Tongji Hospital of Wuhan, China, from January 27, 2020 to March 24, 2020, were grouped into metformin and no-metformin groups according to the diabetic medications used.
32446312,The demographics, characteristics, laboratory parameters, treatments, and clinical outcome in these patients were retrospectively assessed.
32446312,A total of 283 patients (104 in the metformin and 179 in the no-metformin group) were included in this study.
32446312,There were no significant differences between the two groups in gender, age, underlying diseases, clinical severity, and oxygen-support category at admission.
32446312,The fasting blood glucose level of the metformin group was higher than that of the no-metformin group at admission and was under effective control in both groups after admission.
32446312,Other laboratory parameters at admission and treatments after admission were not different between the two groups.
32446312,The length of hospital stay did not differ between the two groups (21.0 days for metformin versus 19.5 days for no metformin, <i>P</i> = 0.74).
32446312,However, in-hospital mortality was significantly lower in the metformin group (3/104 (2.9%) versus 22/179 (12.3%), <i>P</i> = 0.01).
32446312,Antidiabetic treatment with metformin was associated with decreased mortality compared with diabetics not receiving metformin.
32446312,This retrospective analysis suggests that metformin may offer benefits in patients with COVID-19 and that further study is indicated.
32446538,The recent pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has now spread worldwide and caused more than 51,000 deaths, by April 2nd 2020.
32446538,As predicted, there are several obstacles for medical and governmental authorities to efficiently manage this respiratory illness.
32446538,In spite of appropriated supplies, most hospitals are suffering from a scarcity of free beds, protective masks, sanitizing liquids and even ECMO machines for patients with severe cases.
32446538,Defeating this pandemic is impossible without united and coordinated international attempts shaped by all countries of the world.
32446538,We believe that an international scaled-determination is required to diminish the complex impacts of pandemic.
32446538,The most important priorities are supposed to be i) The development of potential vaccine candidates to provide protection and interrupt the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, ii) To ensure enough supplies for hospitals and their homogeneous distribution among the countries with the worst number of severe cases, iii) There is a need for more studies to identify potential treatments that are effective for the control of this viral infection and iv) It is imperative to provide easy access to diagnostic kits for all countries affected by this pandemic.
32446538,In the light of these suggestions, it would be recommendable to at least temporarily abandon the political checkouts in both national and international levels; therefore, all partners will be potentially able to efficiently enforce their strategies for the elimination of this unique threat to the human populations.
32446795,The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, China, and was characterized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization.
32446795,Diabetes is an established risk associated with poor clinical outcomes, but the association of diabetes with COVID-19 has not been reported yet.
32446795,In this cohort study, we retrospectively reviewed 258 consecutive hospitalized COVID-19 patients with or without diabetes at the West Court of Union Hospital in Wuhan, China, recruited from January 29 to February 12, 2020.
32446795,The clinical features, treatment strategies and prognosis data were collected and analyzed.
32446795,Prognosis was followed up until March 12, 2020.
32446795,Of the 258 hospitalized patients (63 with diabetes) with COVID-19, the median age was 64 years (range 23-91), and 138 (53.5%) were male.
32446795,Common symptoms included fever (82.2%), dry cough (67.1%), polypnea (48.1%), and fatigue (38%).
32446795,Patients with diabetes had significantly higher leucocyte and neutrophil counts, and higher levels of fasting blood glucose, serum creatinine, urea nitrogen and creatine kinase isoenzyme MB at admission compared with those without diabetes.
32446795,COVID-19 patients with diabetes were more likely to develop severe or critical disease conditions with more complications, and had higher incidence rates of antibiotic therapy, non-invasive and invasive mechanical ventilation, and death (11.1% vs.
32446795,4.1%).
32446795,Cox proportional hazard model showed that diabetes (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]=3.64; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.09, 12.21) and fasting blood glucose (aHR=1.19; 95% CI: 1.08, 1.31) were associated with the fatality due to COVID-19, adjusting for potential confounders.
32446795,Diabetes mellitus is associated with increased disease severity and a higher risk of mortality in patients with COVID-19.
32446801,A novel small enveloped RNA virus with the typical characteristic of the family to which it belongs, a crown, hence the name coronavirus, appeared in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and subdued the world to its influence.
32446801,The particular severity of the disease and higher mortality rates in patients with associated morbidities, including hypertension, obesity and diabetes, increases the concern over the consequences of this pandemic.
32446801,In this review, the features of SARS-CoV-2 will be addressed, as well as the reasons why it poses a particular challenge to diabetic patients.
32446801,We will also highlight the recent treatment strategies being explored to control this pandemic.
32446801,Emerging evidence demonstrates that the correct management of diabetes in those patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 is of utmost importance for the viral disease progression, therefore, the importance of blood glucose control will also be addressed.
32446813,Since the outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia (coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19) in December 2019, it has rapidly spread to 187 countries, causing serious harm to the health of people and a huge social burden.
32446813,However, currently, drugs specifically approved for clinical use are not available, except for vaccines against COVID-19 that are being evaluated.
32446813,Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is capable of performing syndrome differentiation and treatment according to the clinical manifestations of patients, and has a better ability of epidemic prevention and control.
32446813,The authors comprehensively analyzed the etiology and pathogenesis of COVID-19 based on the theory of TCM, and discussed its syndrome differentiation, treatment and prevention measures so as to provide strategies and reference for the prevention and treatment with TCM.
32446866,Oculo-centric factors may provide a key to understanding invasion success by SARS-CoV-2, a highly contagious, potentially lethal, virus with ocular tropism.
32446866,Respiratory infection transmission via the eye and lacrimal-nasal pathway elucidated during the 1918 influenza pandemic, remains to be explored in this crisis.
32446866,The eye and its adnexae represent a large surface area directly exposed to airborne viral particles and hand contact.
32446866,The virus may bind to corneal and conjunctival angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors and potentially to the lipophilic periocular skin and superficial tear film with downstream carriage into the nasopharynx and subsequent access to the lungs and gut.
32446866,Adenoviruses and influenza viruses share this ocular tropism and despite differing ocular and systemic manifestations and disease patterns, common lessons, particularly in management, emerge.
32446866,Slit lamp usage places ophthalmologists at particular risk of exposure to high viral loads (and poor prognosis) and as for adenoviral epidemics, this may be a setting for disease transmission.
32446866,Local, rather than systemic treatments blocking virus binding in this pathway (advocated for adenovirus) are worth considering.
32446866,This pathway is accessible with eye drops or aerosols containing drugs which appear efficacious via systemic administration.
32446866,A combination such as hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and zinc, all of which have previously been used topically in the eye and which work at least in part by blocking ACE2 receptors, may offer a safe, cost-effective and resource-sparing intervention.
32446978,Italy was the first European country hit by the COVID-19 pandemic and has the highest number of recorded COVID-19 deaths in Europe.
32446978,This prospective cohort study of the correlates of the risk of death in COVID-19 patients was conducted at the Infectious Diseases and Intensive Care units of Luigi Sacco Hospital, Milan, Italy.
32446978,The clinical characteristics of all the COVID-19 patients hospitalised in the early days of the epidemic (21 February -19 March 2020) were recorded upon admission, and the time-dependent probability of death was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method (censored as of 20 April 2020).
32446978,Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess the factors independently associated with the risk of death.
32446978,Forty-eight (20.6%) of the 233 patients followed up for a median of 40 days (interquartile range 33-47) died during the follow-up.
32446978,Most were males (69.1%) and their median age was 61 years (IQR 50-72).
32446978,The time-dependent probability of death was 19.7% (95% CI 14.6-24.9%) 30 days after hospital admission.
32446978,Age (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 2.08, 95% CI 1.48-2.92 per ten years more) and obesity (aHR 3.04, 95% CI 1.42-6.49) were independently associated with an increased risk of death, which was also associated with critical disease (aHR 8.26, 95% CI 1.41-48.29), C-reactive protein levels (aHR 1.17, 95% CI 1.02-1.35 per 50 mg/L more) and creatinine kinase levels above 185 U/L (aHR 2.58, 95% CI 1.37-4.87) upon admission.
32446978,Case-fatality rate of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the early days of the Italian epidemic was about 20%.
32446978,Our study adds evidence to the notion that older age, obesity and more advanced illness are factors associated to an increased risk of death among patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
32447059,In Ontario, on March 16<sup>th</sup>, 2020, a directive was issued to all acute care hospitals to halt non-essential procedures in anticipation for a potential surge in COVID-19 patients.
32447059,This included scheduled outpatient cardiac surgical and interventional procedures that required the use of intensive care units, ventilators, and skilled critical care personnel, given that these procedures would draw from the same pool of resources required for critically ill COVID-19 patients.
32447059,We adapted the COVID-19 Resource Estimator (CORE) decision analytic model by adding a cardiac component to determine the impact of various policy decisions on the incremental waitlist growth and estimated waitlist mortality for three key groups of cardiovascular disease patients; coronary artery disease, valvular heart disease, and arrhythmias.
32447059,We provided predictions based on COVID-19 epidemiology available in real-time, in 3 phases.
32447059,First, in the initial crisis phase, in a worst case scenario, we showed that the potential number of waitlist related cardiac deaths would be orders of magnitude less than those who would die of COVID-19 if critical cardiac care resources were diverted to the care of COVID-19 patients.
32447059,Second, with better local epidemiology data, we predicted that across five regions of Ontario, there may be insufficient resources to resume all elective outpatient cardiac procedures.
32447059,Finally in the recovery phase, we showed that the estimated incremental growth in waitlist for all cardiac procedures is likely substantial.
32447059,These outputs informed timely, data-driven decisions during the COVID-19 pandemic regarding the provision of cardiovascular care.
32447101,Diabetes mellitus is challenging in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.
32447101,The prevalence of diabetes patients hospitalized in intensive care units for COVID-19 is two- to threefold higher, and the mortality rate at least double, than that of non-diabetes patients.
32447101,As the population with diabetes is highly heterogeneous, it is of major interest to determine the risk factors of progression to a more serious life-threatening COVID-19 infection.
32447101,This brief review discusses the main findings of CORONADO, a prospective observational study in France that specifically addressed this issue as well as related observations from other countries, mainly China and the US.
32447101,Some prognostic factors beyond old age have been identified: for example, an increased body mass index is a major risk factor for requiring respiratory assistance.
32447101,Indeed, obesity combines several risk factors, including impaired respiratory mechanics, the presence of other comorbidities and inappropriate inflammatory responses, partly due to ectopic fat deposits.
32447101,While previous diabetic microvascular (renal) and macrovascular complications also increase risk of death, the quality of past glucose control had no independent influence on hospitalized diabetes patient outcomes, and whether the quality of glucose control might modulate risk of COVID-19 in non-hospitalized diabetes patients is still unknown.
32447101,In addition, no negative signs regarding the use of RAAS blockers and DPP-4 inhibitors and outcomes of COVID-19 could be identified.
32447101,Hyperglycaemia at the time of hospital admission is associated with poor outcomes, but it may simply be considered a marker of severity of the infection.
32447101,Thus, the impact of glucose control during hospitalization on outcomes related to COVID-19, which was not investigated in the CORONADO study, is certainly deserving of specific investigation.
32447102,Tocilizumab (TCZ) is used for treating moderate-to-severe Covid-19 pneumonia by targeting interleukin-6 receptors (IL-6Rs) and reducing cytokine release.
32447102,Yet, in spite of this therapy, patients with vs. patients without diabetes have an adverse disease course.
32447102,In fact, glucose homoeostasis has influenced the outcomes of diabetes patients with infectious diseases.
32447102,Of the 475 Covid-19-positive patients admitted to infectious disease departments (University of Bologna, University Vanvitelli of Napoli, San Sebastiano Caserta Hospital) in Italy since 1 March 2020, 31 (39.7%) hyperglycaemic and 47 (60.3%) normoglycaemic patients (blood glucose levels ≥140mg/dL) were retrospectively evaluated at admission and during their hospital stay.
32447102,Of note, 20 (64%) hyperglycaemic and 11 (23.4%) normoglycaemic patients had diabetes (P&lt;0.01).
32447102,At admission, hyperglycaemic vs. normoglycaemic patients had fivefold higher IL-6 levels, which persisted even after TCZ administration (P&lt;0.05).
32447102,Intriguingly, in a risk-adjusted Cox regression analysis, TCZ in hyperglycaemic patients failed to attenuate risk of severe outcomes as it did in normoglycaemic patients (P&lt;0.009).
32447102,Also, in hyperglycaemic patients, higher IL-6 plasma levels reduced the effects of TCZ, while adding IL-6 levels to the Cox regression model led to loss of significance (P&lt;0.07) of its effects.
32447102,Moreover, there was evidence that optimal Covid-19 infection management with TCZ is not achieved during hyperglycaemia in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients.
32447102,These data may be of interest to currently ongoing clinical trials of TCZ effects in Covid-19 patients and of optimal control of glycaemia in this patient subset.
32447292,The recent joint statement from the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (ASRA) and the European Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Therapy (ESRA) recommends neuraxial and peripheral nerve blocks for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) illness.
32447292,The benefits of regional anesthetic and analgesic techniques on patient outcomes and healthcare systems are evident.
32447292,Regional techniques are now additionally promoted as a mechanism to reduce aerosolizing procedures.
32447292,However, caring for patients with COVID-19 illness requires rapid redefinition of risks and benefits-both for patients and practitioners.
32447292,These should be fully considered within the context of available evidence and expert opinion.
32447292,In this Daring Discourse, we present two opposing perspectives on adopting the ASRA/ESRA recommendation.
32447292,Areas of controversy in the literature and opportunities for research to address knowledge gaps are highlighted.
32447292,We hope this will stimulate dialogue and research into the optimal techniques to improve patient outcomes and ensure practitioner safety during the pandemic.
32447429,The purpose of this review is to quantify the landscape of current clinical trials ongoing for therapies in the treatment of COVID-19.
32447429,A secondary purpose is to examine the relationship between public and scientific interests in potential therapies for COVID-19.
32447429,A systematic search of clinicaltrials.gov was undertaken on April 22, 2020, to identify all currently registered clinical trials investigating potential therapies for patients with COVID-19.
32447429,Public interest in the various therapies was quantified utilizing Google Trends.
32447429,Public interest in hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine was plotted against the cumulative number of active clinical trials evaluating antimalarials as potential COVID-19 therapies over time.
32447429,There were 341 interventional studies and 208 different therapies actively registered on clinicaltrials.gov whose primary aim is the treatment of COVID-19.
32447429,The median sample size was 120 patients (range 4-6000) with 154 (45%) trials reporting a planned sample size of 100 patients or less.
32447429,There was a strong positive correlation (r = 0.76, p = 0.01) between the number of registered clinical trials and the public interest in the top ten proposed therapies.
32447429,Following the spike in public interest, the average number of new trials increased tenfold with respect to antimalarial therapies.
32447429,The relatively small sample sizes and the number of independent trials investigating similar therapies are concerning.
32447429,Resources may not be being allocated based on scientific merit and may be driven by public consciousness and speculation.
32447429,Moving forward, a concerted effort focused on implementing large, well-coordinated and carefully designed multi-armed clinical trials will help to ensure that the most promising therapeutic options are rigorously studied and clinically meaningful results produced.
32447603,The current 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak is continuing to spread rapidly despite all efforts.
32447603,Patients with rheumatic disease may have higher levels of anxiety due to their disease characteristics and medications.
32447603,The web-based platforms are widely used sources for gaining medical information.
32447603,YouTube presents a wide range of medical information, but there are concerns on its quality.
32447603,Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the quality of the YouTube videos about COVID-19 and rheumatic diseases link.
32447603,This is a descriptive study.
32447603,A total of 360 videos listed by the YouTube search engine (www.youtube.com) in response to six search terms were evaluated.
32447603,The Global Quality Scale (GQS) was performed to evaluate video quality.
32447603,Three groups were formed according to GQS scores: high quality, moderate quality, and low quality.
32447603,Video parameters were compared between these groups.
32447603,After the exclusion criteria, 46 videos were reviewed.
32447603,Of the videos, 41.4% (n = 19) were of high-quality group, 21.7% (n = 10) were moderate-quality group, and 36.9% (n = 17) were of low-quality group.
32447603,Significant difference was detected between the quality groups in terms of views per day (p = 0.004).
32447603,No significant difference was detected in comments per day (p = 0.139) and like ratio (p = 0.232).
32447603,Besides high-quality videos, there were substantially low-quality videos that could cause misleading information to spread rapidly during the pandemic.
32447603,Videos from trustworthy sources such as universities, academics, and physicians should be kept in the foreground.Key Points•Web-based platforms have become an important source of health-related information.
32447603,One of the most important online sources is YouTube because it is easy accessible and free.
32447603,•Of the videos evaluating the link between COVID-19 and rheumatic diseases, 41.4% (n = 19) were of high quality.
32447603,•The main sources of high-quality videos were academics/universities and physicians.
32447603,•The most frequently discussed topics in videos were the place of hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19 and whether to continue the use of existing rheumatological drugs.
32447742,The month of December 2019 became a critical part of the time of humanity when the first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was reported in the Wuhan, Hubei Province in China.
32447742,As of April 13th, 2020, there have been approximately 1.9 million cases and 199,000 deaths across the world, which were associated with COVID-19.
32447742,The COVID-19 is the seventh coronavirus to be identified to infect humans.
32447742,In the past, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome were the two coronaviruses that infected humans with a high fatality, particularly among the elderly.
32447742,Fatalities due to COVID-19 are higher in patients older than 50 years of age or those with multimorbid conditions.
32447742,The COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets, with the most common symptoms being high fever, cough, myalgia, atypical symptoms included sputum production, headache, hemoptysis and diarrhea.
32447742,However, the incubation period can range from 2 to 14 days without any symptoms.
32447742,It is particularly true with gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in which patients can still shed the virus even after pulmonary symptoms have resolved.
32447742,Given the high percentage of COVID-19 patients that present with GI symptoms (e.g., nausea and diarrhea), screening patients for GI symptoms remain essential.
32447742,Recently, cases of fecal-oral transmission of COVID-19 have been confirmed in the USA and China, indicating that the virus can replicate in both the respiratory and digestive tract.
32447742,Moreover, the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, diagnostic procedures, treatments and prevention of the gastrointestinal manifestations of COVID-19 remain to be elucidated.
32447777,During the COVID-19 pandemic, incidence rates for dental diseases will continue unabated.
32447777,However, the intent to prevent the spread of this lethal respiratory disease will likely lead to reduced treatment access due to restrictions on population movements.
32447777,These changes have the potential to increase dental-related emergency department visits and subsequently contribute to greater viral transmission.
32447777,Moreover, dentists experience unique challenges with preventing transmission due to frequent aerosol-producing procedures.
32447777,This paper presents reviews and protocols implemented by directors and residents at the Dental College of Georgia to manage a dental emergency clinic during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32447777,The methods presented include committee-based prioritization of dental patients, a multilayered screening process, team rotations with social and temporal spacing, and modified treatment room protocols.
32447777,These efforts aid in the reduction of viral transmission, conservation of personal protective equipment, and expand provider availability.
32447777,These protocols transcend a university and hospital-based models and are applicable to private and corporate models.
32447820,The world entered the year 2020 with reports of the emergence of a new viral illness in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.
32447820,In January 2020, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified to be the causative novel coronavirus for the cluster of patients suffering from pneumonia in China.
32447820,The disease was later named as coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020.
32447820,Several studies, since then, have tried to study and explain the origin of SARS-CoV-2, its structure and pathogenicity, epidemiology, modes of transmission, spectrum of illness and causes of mortality and morbidity.
32447820,The current management strategies focus on supportive care and prevention of complications.
32447820,With no definite treatment, as of now, encouraging reports of some anti-viral and anti-malarial drugs in the management of COVID-19 generate some hope.
32447820,This review intends to cover the current known aspects of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-19, based on the available literature.
32447846,The situation of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is still severe at present.
32447846,In order to better fight against the epidemic and give full play to the advantages of traditional Chinese medicine, we explored the feasibility of acupuncture therapy in the intervention of COVID-19 through analyzing the relevant literature in both ancient and modern time.
32447846,Additionally, we analyzed the intervention scheme of acupuncture for COVID-19 developed by China Association of Acupuncture and Moxibustion and supplemented the protocol of the intervention with auricular acupuncture.
32447846,It was proposed that the advantages of acupuncture and moxibustion should be fully displayed while Chinese herbal medications have been applied in the treatment of COVID-19.
32447846,During treatment, acupuncture physicians should be rationally allocated to a certain proportion so as to adequately utilize comprehensive therapeutic approaches and guarantee people's safety to the greatest extent.
32447846,Eventually, the clinical therapeutic effect may be improved, the national resources be economized on and the COVID-19 epidemic be conquered early.
32447934,<b>Objective:</b> To investigate the clinical and coagulation characteristics in patients with critical Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and acro-ischemia. <b>Methods:</b> The retrospective study included 7 critical COVID-19 patients with acro-ischemia in an intensive care unit (ICU) in Wuhan, from Feb 4 to Feb 15, 2020.
32447934,The clinical and laboratory data before and during the ICU stay were analyzed. <b>Results:</b> The median age of 7 patients was 59 years and 4 of them were men.
32447934,Three patients were associated with underlying comorbidities.
32447934,Fever, cough, dyspnea and diarrhea were common clinical symptoms.
32447934,All patients had acro-ischemia presentations including finger/toe cyanosis, skin bulla and dry gangrene.
32447934,D-dimer, fibrinogen and fibrinogen degradation product (FDP) were significantly elevated in most patients.
32447934,Prothrombin time was prolonged in 4 patients.
32447934,D-dimer and FDP levels progressively elevated consistent with COVID-2019 exacerbation.
32447934,Four patients were diagnosed with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) .
32447934,Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) was administrated in 6 patients, which reduced D-dimer and FDP rather than improved clinical symptoms.
32447934,Five patients died finally and the median time from acro-ischemia to death was 12 days. <b>Conclusions:</b> Coagulation parameters should be monitored closely in critical COVID-2019 patients.
32447934,The timing and protocol of anticoagulation therapy are still under investigation based on more clinical data. <b>目的：</b> 总结合并肢端缺血的新型冠状病毒肺炎（COVID-19）患者的临床和凝血功能特征。
32447934,<b>方法：</b> 回顾性分析2020年2月5日至2020年2月15日北京协和医院国家医疗队在武汉收治的7例危重型COVID-19患者临床及实验室资料。

32448039,The global health emergency of novel COVID-19 is due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32448039,Currently there are no approved drugs for the treatment of coronaviral disease (COVID-19), although some of the drugs have been tried.
32448039,Chloroquine is being widely used in treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32448039,Hydroxychloroquine, the derivative of Chloroquine shows better inhibition than Chloroquine and has in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 also used to treat COVID-19.
32448039,To study the interactions of Chloroquine and derivatives of Chloroquine with SARS-CoV-2, series of computational approaches like pharmacophore model, molecular docking, MM_GBSA study and ADME property analysis are explored.
32448039,The pharmacophore model and molecular docking study are used to explore the structural properties of the compounds and the ligand-receptor (<b>PDB_ID: 6LU7</b>) interactions respectively.
32448039,MM_GBSA study gives the binding free energy of the protein-ligand complex and ADME property analysis explains the pharmacological property of the compounds.
32448039,The resultant best molecule (<b>CQD15)</b> further subjected to molecular dynamics (MD) simulation study which explains the protein stability (RMSD), ligand properties as well as protein-ligand contacts.
32448039,Outcomes of the present study conclude with the molecule <b>CQD15</b> which shows better interactions for the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine.
32448333,COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly spread in Italy in late February 2020.
32448333,Almost all surgical services have been reorganized, with the aim of maintaining an adequate therapeutic path, especially for surgical emergencies.
32448333,The knowledge of how surgeons dealing with emergency surgery have reacted to the epidemic in the real life can be useful while drafting clinical recommendations.
32448333,Surgeons from multiple Italian regions were invited answering to an online survey in order to make a snapshot of their current behaviors towards COVID-19-positive patients bearing urgent surgical diseases.
32448333,Questions about institutional rules and personal approach for patient treatment and to limit epidemic spread were included in a 37-item questionnaire.
32448333,Seventy-one questionnaires from institutions dealing with emergency surgery were accepted.
32448333,Participating surgeons were equally subdivided from a geographical point of view, with a large proportion of public (97.2%) and non-academical (91.5%) centers.
32448333,In 80.3% of cases, the hospitals treated COVID-19 patients; in 69.1% of centers, a change in work plan was necessary, and 33.8% of teams had almost a surgeon infected or in preventive quarantine.
32448333,The vast majority of surgeons operated only on urgent cases (73.9%), but the number of interventions significantly dropped.
32448333,Up to 40% of non-traumatic abdominal emergency cases had an unusual delayed treatment.
32448333,The laparoscopic approach was used in 69.6% of interventions on COVID-19 patients.
32448333,Strategies to protect health care workers against COVID-19 infection and to identify asymptomatic infected surgeons were suboptimal with respect to the WHO recommendations in 70.4% and 90.2% of centers, respectively.
32448333,Advanced personal protective equipment for operating room workers was adopted for all surgeries in only 12.7% of centers.
32448333,This survey confirms that the COVID-19 outbreak is dramatically changing the practice of emergency surgery centers in Italy.
32448333,Despite the reduction in number, urgent cases were on average more challenging owing to diagnostic delay.
32448333,Recommendations from the International Scientific Societies are frequently not complied concerning the use of laparoscopic approach, the availability of personal protective equipment in the operating rooms, and the testing of both asymptomatic physicians and patients scheduled for surgery.
32448333,A further evaluation of the short-term results of these attitudes is warranted to modulate international recommendations.
32448345,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a novel corinavirus (later named SARS-CoV-2 virus), was fistly reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China towards the end of 2019.
32448345,Large-scale spread within China and internationally led the World Health Organization to declare a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30<sup>th</sup> January 2020.
32448345,The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 virus infection include asymptomatic infection, mild upper respiratory symptoms, severe viral pneumonia with respiratory failure, and even death.
32448345,There are no antivirals of proven clinical efficacy in coronavirus infections.
32448345,Remdesivir (GS-5734), a nucleoside analogue, has inhibitory effects on animal and human highly pathogenic coronaviruses, including MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, in in vitro and in vivo experiments.
32448345,It is also inhibitory against the COVID-19 virus in vitro.
32448345,The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of remdesivir in adult patients with severe COVID-19.
32448345,The protocol is prepared in accordance with the SPIRIT (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials) guidelines.
32448345,This is a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial.
32448345,Adults (≥ 18 years) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 virus infection, severe pneumonia signs or symptoms, and radiologically confirmed severe pneumonia are randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to intravenously administered remdesivir or placebo for 10 days.
32448345,The primary endpoint is time to clinical improvement (censored at day 28), defined as the time (in days) from randomization of study treatment (remdesivir or placebo) until a decline of two categories on a six-category ordinal scale of clinical status (1 = discharged; 6 = death) or live discharge from hospital.
32448345,One interim analysis for efficacy and futility will be conducted once half of the total number of events required has been observed.
32448345,This is the first randomized, placebo-controlled trial in COVID-19.
32448345,Enrolment began in sites in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China on 6<sup>th</sup> February 2020.
32448345,ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04257656.
32448345,Registered on 6 February 2020.
32448377,Acute lung injury (ALI), an increasingly devastating human disorder, is characterized by a multitude of lung changes arising from a wide variety of lung injuries.
32448377,Viral infection is the main cause of morbidity and mortality in ALI and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients.
32448377,In particular, influenza virus, coronavirus, and other respiratory viruses circulate in nature in various animal species and can cause severe and rapidly spread human infections.
32448377,Although scientific advancements have allowed for rapid progress to be made to understand the pathogenesis and develop therapeutics after each viral pandemic, few effective methods to treat virus-induced ALI have been described.
32448377,Recently, stem cell therapy has been widely used in the treatment of various diseases, including ALI.
32448377,In this review, we detail the present stem cell-based therapeutics for lung injury caused by influenza virus and the outlook for the future state of stem cell therapy to deal with emerging influenza and coronaviruses.
32448490,At the end of the year 2019, the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was spreading in Wuhan, China, and the outbreak process has a high speed.
32448490,It was recognized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020.
32448490,Coronaviruses are enveloped and single-stranded RNA that have several families including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).
32448490,The pathogenesis mechanism and disease outcomes of SARS and MERS are now clear to some extent, but little information is available for 2019-nCoV.
32448490,This newly identified corona virus infection represents flu-like symptoms, but usually the first symptoms are fever and dry cough.
32448490,There has been no specific treatment against 2019-nCoV up to now, and physicians only apply supportive therapy.
32448490,In the present article, we made an attempt to review the behavior of the virus around the world, epidemiology, a pathway for influx into the host cells, clinical presentation, as well as the treatments currently in use and future approaches; nitazoxanide may be our dream drug.
32448490,We hope that this review has a positive impact on public knowledge for helping to deal with the 2019-nCoV and move one step forward toward its treatment in the near future.
32448633,The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is a global health emergency and we need to know more about it.
32448633,Patients with cardiovascular risk and previous kidney risk have been identified as especially vulnerable for greater morbidity and mortality when they suffer from COVID-19.
32448633,A considerable proportion of patients can develop a vascular lesion in the context of the disease that entails a greater lethality.
32448633,Cardiovascular and renal complications represent a problem and, probably in the near future, may pose a threat to patients who have survived COVID-19.
32448633,As physicians, we cannot forget that during an epidemic like this, other chronic diseases are present, and patients continue to require care.
32448633,We are obliged to monitor even more intensely their treatments and control degree.
32448633,Furthermore, we must not forget that urgent situations continue to arise in this pandemic situation and require prompt attention.
32448633,In this current situation, it is very likely that many patients, out of fear, have not sought medical attention.
32448633,The situation during the epidemic and the uncertainty of the post-COVID-19 period, requires intensification in the control and monitoring of cardiovascular and kidney disease in our patients.
32448633,Primary care constitutes a key level of care for the care of the population with cardiovascular disease.
32448633,Likewise, and in the face of this new health scenario, we need to promote the prevention and control measures that emanate from the studies currently underway.
32448633,Now, more than ever, we need research, crucial to improve the cardiovascular and renal prognosis of our patients.
32448805,The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread to many countries and has been declared a global health emergency.
32448805,Our center is located in the south of Italy where the infection rates were low and the clusters of COVID-19 positive patients were small and inhomogeneous.
32448805,The aim of this short report is to share our experience as a starting point for the management of the steady state of the pandemic.
32448805,The safety of the patients and department staff required a strict plan to minimize the risk of infection between operators whose absence would have made it impossible to carry out the radiotherapy treatments.
32448805,The head of the radiotherapy unit and members of the Hospital Crisis Unit have put in place a series of measures to manage the emergency.
32448805,A &quot;clean&quot; team has been established whose members are kept out of the radiotherapy unit for 2 weeks on rotation.
32448805,Several separate work areas have been made in order to reduce direct contact between the staff.
32448805,Each staff member has to wear protective equipment if close contact with patients is required.
32448805,Before confirming a radiotherapy consult or a follow-up visit, telephone clinical and epidemiological screening is performed by nurses through a questionnaire regarding the presence of respiratory symptoms or eventual social contacts with COVID-19 positive people.
32448805,Once the patients arrive in the hospital, a triage point at the entrance to the hospital performs a second screening and a temperature check.
32448805,This management experience of a radiotherapy unit in Southern Italy could serve as a useful example for the future.
32448805,In fact, in the steady state of infection many centers may face epidemiologically contagious numbers similar to those that we currently have in our region.
32448805,These numbers require the maintenance of alert and precautionary measures which in our case seem to have worked.
32448818,The number of patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly increased, although the WHO declared a pandemic.
32448818,However, drugs that function against SARS-CoV-2 have not been established.
32448818,SARS-CoV-2 has been suggested to bind angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, the receptor of the SARS coronavirus.
32448818,SARS coronavirus and coronavirus 229E, the cause of the common cold, replicate through cell-surface and endosomal pathways using a protease, the type II transmembrane protease.
32448818,To examine the effects of protease inhibitors on the replication of coronavirus 229E, we pretreated primary cultures of human nasal epithelial (HNE) cells with camostat or nafamostat, each of which has been used for the treatment of pancreatitis and/or disseminated intravascular coagulation.
32448818,HNE cells were then infected with coronavirus 229E, and viral titers in the airway surface liquid of the cells were examined.
32448818,Pretreatment with camostat (0.1-10 μg/mL) or nafamostat (0.01-1 μg/mL) reduced the titers of coronavirus 229E.
32448818,Furthermore, a significant amount of type II transmembrane protease protein was detected in the airway surface liquid of HNE cells.
32448818,Additionally, interferons have been reported to have antiviral effects against SARS coronavirus.
32448818,The additive effects of interferons on the inhibitory effects of other candidate drugs to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection, such as lopinavir, ritonavir and favipiravir, have also been studied.
32448818,These findings suggest that protease inhibitors of this type may inhibit coronavirus 229E replication in human airway epithelial cells at clinical concentrations.
32448818,Protease inhibitors, interferons or the combination of these drugs may become candidate drugs to inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2.
32449022,SARS-CoV-2 is a new pandemic influenza caused by a coronavirus which main route of transmission is through exhaled droplets that primarily infect the nose and the nasopharynx.
32449022,The aim of this paper is to evaluate the effect of acetic acid, the active component of vinegar, as a potential disinfectant agent for upper airways.
32449022,Twenty-nine patients were enrolled and divided into two groups: group 1 (14 patients) was composed of patients treated with off-label hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir, whereas group 2 (15 patients) was composed of patients treated with hydroxychloroquine only, combined with the inhalation of acetic acid disinfectant at a 0.34% concentration.
32449022,A questionnaire-based evaluation of symptoms was performed after 15 days in both groups.
32449022,It appears that the number of patients treated with acetic acid (group 2) that experienced improvement in individual symptoms was double that of the other group of patients (group 1), although numbers are too small for robust statistical analysis.
32449022,Considering its potential benefits and high availability, acetic acid disinfection appears to be a promising adjunctive therapy in cases of non-severe COVID-19 and deserves further investigation.
32449057,We report the neuropathological findings of a patient who died from complications of COVID-19.
32449057,The decedent was initially hospitalized for surgical management of underlying coronary artery disease.
32449057,He developed post-operative complications and was evaluated with chest imaging studies.
32449057,The chest computed tomography (CT) imaging results were indicative of COVID-19 and he was subsequently tested for SARS-CoV-2, which was positive.
32449057,His condition worsened and he died after more than 2 weeks of hospitalization and aggressive treatment.
32449057,The autopsy revealed a range of neuropathological lesions, with features resembling both vascular and demyelinating etiologies.
32449057,Hemorrhagic white matter lesions were present throughout the cerebral hemispheres with surrounding axonal injury and macrophages.
32449057,The subcortical white matter had scattered clusters of macrophages, a range of associated axonal injury, and a perivascular acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)-like appearance.
32449057,Additional white matter lesions included focal microscopic areas of necrosis with central loss of white matter and marked axonal injury.
32449057,Rare neocortical organizing microscopic infarcts were also identified.
32449057,Imaging and clinical reports have demonstrated central nervous system complications in patients' with COVID-19, but there is a gap in our understanding of the neuropathology.
32449057,The lesions described in this case provide insight into the potential parainfectious processes affecting COVID-19 patients, which may direct clinical management and ongoing research into the disease.
32449057,The clinical course of the patient also illustrates that during prolonged hospitalizations neurological complications of COVID may develop, which are particularly difficult to evaluate and appreciate in the critically ill.
32449128,There are no large reported series determining the Covid-19 cancer patient's characteristics.
32449128,We determine whether differences exist in cumulative incidence and mortality of Covid-19 infection between cancer patients and general population in Madrid.
32449128,We reviewed 1069 medical records of all cancer patients admitted at Oncology department between Feb 1 and April 7, 2020.
32449128,We described Covid-19 cumulative incidence, treatment outcome, mortality, and associated risk factors.
32449128,We detected 45/1069 Covid-19 diagnoses in cancer patients vs 42,450/6,662,000 in total population (p &lt; 0.00001).
32449128,Mortality rate: 19/45 cancer patients vs 5586/42,450 (p = 0.0001).
32449128,Mortality was associated with older median age, adjusted by staging and histology (74 vs 63.5 years old, OR 1.06, p = 0.03).
32449128,Patients who combined hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin presented 3/18 deaths, regardless of age, staging, histology, cancer treatment and comorbidities (OR 0.02, p = 0.03).
32449128,Cancer patients are vulnerable to Covid-19 with an increase in complications.
32449128,Combined hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin is presented as a good treatment option.
32449169,Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of convalescent plasma as a possible treatment has been explored.
32449169,Here we describe our experience as the first US organization creating a COVID-19 convalescent plasma program to support compassionate use through the single patient emergency IND, the National Expanded Access Program and multiple randomized control trials.
32449169,Within weeks, we were able to distribute over 8000 products, scale up collections to over 4,000 units per week, meet hospital demand, as well as support randomized controlled trials to evaluate the efficacy of convalescent plasma treatment.
32449169,This was through strategic planning, re-deployment of staff, and active engagement of hospital, community, and public health partners.
32449169,Our partners helped with donor recruitment, testing, patient advocacy, and patient availability.
32449169,The program will continue to evolve as we learn more about optimizing the product.
32449169,Remaining issues to be resolved are antibody titers, dose, and at what stage of disease to transfuse.
32449224,Since the December 2019 discovery of several cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China, the infection has spread worldwide.
32449224,Our aim is to report on the clinical characteristics, treatments and prognoses of COVID-19.
32449224,This was a retrospective, single-centre, case series of 136 patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 at Wuhan Third Hospital in Wuhan, China, between 28 January 2020 and 12 February 2020.
32449224,The clinical characteristics, laboratory tests, treatment features and prognoses were summarized.
32449224,The 136 patients were divided into a moderate (M) group (n = 103, 75.7%) and a severe and critical (SC) group (n = 33, 24.3%).
32449224,There were significant differences in the incidences of concomitant chronic medical illnesses (eg, hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular disease), fever, dry cough and dyspnoea among the two groups (P &lt; .05).
32449224,Compared with those in the M group, lymphocyte count (LYM) decreased significantly in the SC group, while the serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), creatinine (Cre), D-dimer, lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), myoglobin (MB) and troponin I (cTnl) increased significantly in the SC group (P &lt; .05).
32449224,The main therapeutic drugs were antivirals, antibiotics, glucocorticoids, immunomodulators, traditional Chinese medicine preparations and symptomatic support drugs.
32449224,There were significant differences in the incidences of shock, myocardial injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and renal injury among the two groups (P &lt; .05).
32449224,Among the 136 patients, 99 (72.7%) were cured, 14 (10.3%) were transferred to other hospital and 23 (16.9%) died.
32449224,Elderly patients with chronic diseases are more likely to develop severe or critical COVID-19 with multiple organ damage or systemic injuries.
32449224,The improvement of LYM and CRP may be associated with the prognoses of COVID-19.
32449224,The combined use of three or more antiviral drugs is to be avoided.
32449224,The combination of broad-spectrum antibacterial drugs is not recommended and the risk of drug-induced liver injury should be monitored.
32449224,Throughout a patient's hospitalization, their treatment plan should be evaluated and adjusted according to their vital signs, clinical symptoms, laboratory tests and imaging changes.
32449224,Patients should receive effective psychological counselling.
32449235,Although immunosuppressed patients may be more prone to SARS-CoV-2 infection with atypical presentation, long-term immunosuppression therapy may provide some sort of protection for severe clinical complications of COVID-19.
32449235,The interaction between immunosuppression and new antiviral drugs in the treatment of transplanted patients contracting COVID-19 has not yet been fully investigated.
32449235,Moreover, data regarding the optimal management of these patients are still very limited.
32449235,We report a case of the successful recovery from severe COVID-19 of a kidney-transplanted patient treated with hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, steroid and tocilizumab.
32449333,The intriguing aspects of SARS-CoV-2 virus are the high rate of spread and rapid progression of pneumonitis.
32449333,Confronted with thousands of deaths daily worldwide, we have to build quickly the rationale behind the treatment, taking advantage from past analogues.
32449333,When a new virus strikes, T-cell receptor (TCR) gamma/delta cells are in the first line of defence, activated by stress molecules and recognising some epitopes in a process that is major histocompatibility complex (MHC) independent but still specific, e.g. cytomegalovirus (CMV), as well as participating in the regulatory mechanism - both characteristics are useful in fighting SARS-CoV-2.
32449333,The fatalities are mostly due to pneumonitis, in the course of which an overwhelming inflammatory process impairs blood oxygenation, calling for artificial ventilation.
32449333,In fatal COVID-19 cases the balance between the immune response and the inflammatory outcome fails, due to which the patients at risk, mostly aged, have higher levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and an enhanced inflammatory process in the lung.
32449333,Apparently there is no feedback control over the antibody production.
32449333,The investigational use of convalescent plasma, providing antibodies taken from patients who have recovered, was shown to be effective, likely through exerting idiotype associated negative control of antibody production.
32449333,Similarly, the use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) may assist the body regulatory mechanisms, knowing the anti-inflammatory potential of these cells.
32449333,The use of these two immunotherapeutic tools is understandable on the grounds of basic immunology, whose knowledge may direct the medical community in efforts to fight the virus.
32449420,<b>Objective</b>: We aimed to detect the malignant arrhythmic potential of COVID-19 with surface electrocardiographic (ECG) markers.<b>Material and method:</b> Of the ECG parameters PR, QT, QTc, QTd, TPe, and Tpe/QTc were measured in 51 COVID-19 patients and 40 in control subjects.<b>Results</b>: Compared to control group mean QTc (410.8 ± 24.3 msec vs.
32449420,394.6 ± 20.3 msec, <i>p</i> &lt; .001) and Tpe/QTc (0.19 ± 0.02 vs.
32449420,0.18 ± 0.04, <i>p</i> = .036) and median QTd (47.52 vs.
32449420,46.5) values were significantly higher in COVID-19 patients.
32449420,Troponin levels were significantly correlated with heart rate (<i>r</i> = 0.387, <i>p</i> = .006) but not with ECG parameters.<b>Conclusion:</b> Several ventricular arrhythmia surface ECG predictors including QTc, QTd, and Tpe/QTc are increased in COVID-19 patients.
32449420,Since medications used in COVID-19 patients have the potential to affect these parameters, giving importance to these ECG markers may have a significant contribution in decreasing disease-related arrhythmias.
32449523,The unprecedented COVID-19 crisis presents an imperative for mental health care systems to make digital mental health interventions a routine part of care.
32449523,Already because of COVID-19, many therapists have rapidly moved to using telehealth in place of in-person contact.
32449523,In response to this shift, Waller and colleagues compiled a series of expert recommendations to help clinicians pivot to delivering teletherapy to address eating disorders during COVID-19.
32449523,However, numerous barriers still impede widespread adoption and implementation of digital interventions.
32449523,In this commentary, we aim to extend the recommendations for clinicians offered by Waller and colleagues by presenting a roadmap of the systems- and policy-level requirements that are needed.
32449523,We advocate for addressing barriers associated with training, licensing, safety, privacy, payment, and evaluation, as these factors have greatly limited use of these promising interventions.
32449523,We also indicate that longer-term goals should include introducing truly innovative digital mental health practices, such as stepped-care models and simultaneously providing preventive and self-management services in addition to clinical services, into the health care system.
32449523,Now is the time to catalyze change and comprehensively address the barriers that have prevented widespread delivery of these efficacious digital services to the millions of people who would benefit.
32449528,The impact of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on clinical features of Parkinson's disease (PD) has been poorly characterized so far.
32449528,Out of 141 PD patients resident in Lombardy, we found twelve COVID-19 cases (8.5%), whose mean age and disease duration (65.5 and 6.3 years, respectively) were similar to controls.
32449528,Changes in clinical features in the period January-April 2020 were compared with those of 36 PD control subjects, matched for sex, age, and disease-duration, using the clinical impression of severity index for PD, the Movement Disorders Society Unified PD Rating Scale parts II and IV, and the non-motor symptoms scale.
32449528,Motor and nonmotor symptoms significantly worsened in the COVID-19 group, requiring therapy adjustment in one-third of cases.
32449528,Clinical deterioration was explained by both infection-related mechanisms and impaired pharmacokinetics of dopaminergic therapy.
32449528,Urinary issues and fatigue were the most prominent nonmotor issues.
32449528,Cognitive functions were marginally involved, while none experienced autonomic failure.

32449757,Caring for older patients with breast cancer presents unique clinical considerations due to preexisting and competing comorbidity, the potential for treatment-related toxicity, and the consequent impact on functional status.
32449757,In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, treatment decision-making for older patients is especially challenging and encourages us to re-focus our treatment priorities.
32449757,While we work to avoid treatment delays and maintain therapeutic benefit, we also need to minimize the risk for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) exposures, myelosuppression, general chemotherapy toxicity, and functional decline.
32449757,Herein, we propose multidisciplinary care considerations for the aging patient with breast cancer, with the goal to promote a team-based, multidisciplinary treatment approach during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.
32449757,These considerations remain relevant as we navigate the 'new normal' for the approximately 30% of breast cancer patients age ≥70 years who are diagnosed in the U.S. annually and for the thousands of older patients living with recurrent and/or metastatic disease.
32449792,HIV and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) co-infection is a major challenge for the clinicians as it urged the importance of developing an optimal pharmaceutical scheme and patient's management.
32449792,The reports that have been recently published regarding the course of SARS-CoV-2 in patients with HIV are sparse.
32449792,In this brief report we describe, our first single-centre experience from a 58-year-old Caucasian male patient with HIV who developed a severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, including clinical characteristics, treatment, and outcomes.

32449972,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is spreading at a rapid pace, and the World Health Organization declared it as pandemic on 11 March 2020.
32449972,Mycoplasma pneumoniae is an &quot;atypical&quot; bacterial pathogen commonly known to cause respiratory illness in humans.
32449972,The coinfection from SARS-CoV-2 and mycoplasma pneumonia is rarely reported in the literature to the best of our knowledge.
32449972,We present a study in which 6 of 350 patients confirmed with COVID-19 were also diagnosed with M. pneumoniae infection.
32449972,In this study, we described the clinical characteristics of patients with coinfection.
32449972,Common symptoms at the onset of illness included fever (six [100%] patients); five (83.3%) patients had a cough, shortness of breath, and fatigue.
32449972,The other symptoms were myalgia (66.6%), gastrointestinal symptoms (33.3%-50%), and altered mental status (16.7%).
32449972,The laboratory parameters include lymphopenia, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, interleukin-6, serum ferritin, and D-dimer in all six (100%) patients.
32449972,The chest X-ray at presentation showed bilateral infiltrates in all the patients (100%).
32449972,We also described electrocardiogram findings, complications, and treatment during hospitalization in detail.
32449972,One patient died during the hospital course.
32449999,To evaluate the impact of the coronavirus pandemic and the quarantine in orthodontic appointments, and patients' anxiety and concerns about their ongoing orthodontic treatment.
32449999,Settings and sample population Patients from private dental clinics of two orthodontists that were undergoing active orthodontic treatment.
32449999,An online anonymous questionnaire regarding their anxiety about the coronavirus situation, availability/acceptance to attend an appointment, among others, was answered by orthodontic patients.
32449999,Descriptive statistics with percentages was performed and responses were compared between sexes, cities, and association of the feelings/level of anxiety of patients and willingness to attend an appointment, were performed with chi-square, independent t-test, one-way ANOVA and Tukey tests.
32449999,The questionnaire was answered by 354 patients (231 female; 123 male) with mean age of 35.49 years.
32449999,Most patients are respecting the quarantine, 44.7% related to be calm and 46.3% afraid or anxious.
32449999,The level of anxiety was greater for females than males.
32449999,There was significant association of the level of anxiety and the willingness to attend an appointment.
32449999,The greatest concern of patients was delay in the end of treatment.
32449999,The quarantine and coronavirus pandemic showed to have impact on orthodontic appointments and patients' anxiety.
32449999,Patients willing to attend an orthodontic appointment presented significantly lower level of anxiety than patients that would not go or would go only in urgency/emergency.
32449999,Females were more anxious than males about coronavirus pandemic, quarantine and impact on their orthodontic treatments.
32449999,Delay in treatment was the greatest concern of patients undergoing orthodontic treatment.
32450087,To-date, there has not been a clear signal suggesting that asthma or treatment with inhaled steroids are a risk factor for severe COVID-19 disease.
32450087,We have therefore explored ACE2 receptor mRNA expression, and co-factors for Sars-CoV-2 infectivity (TMPRSS2 and furin) in bronchial brushes and biopsies from people with asthma and healthy controls, and looked for relationships between asthma severity, Th2- and IL-17 dependent gene signatures, and clinical demographics (age, sex).
32450087,We have looked at a cohort of 356 research participants from previously described studies.
32450087,The only significant association was a positive correlation between ACE2 and IL-17-dependent gene expression, and an inverse correlation between ACE2 and Th2-cytokine-dependent gene expression.
32450087,These data suggest that differences in ACE2, TMPRSS2 and furin epithelial and airway gene expression are unlikely to confer enhanced COVID-19 pneumonia risk in patients with asthma across all treatment intensities and severity.
32450107,Hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, often in combination with a second-generation macrolide, are being widely used for treatment of COVID-19, despite no conclusive evidence of their benefit.
32450107,Although generally safe when used for approved indications such as autoimmune disease or malaria, the safety and benefit of these treatment regimens are poorly evaluated in COVID-19.
32450107,We did a multinational registry analysis of the use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine with or without a macrolide for treatment of COVID-19.
32450107,The registry comprised data from 671 hospitals in six continents.
32450107,We included patients hospitalised between Dec 20, 2019, and April 14, 2020, with a positive laboratory finding for SARS-CoV-2.
32450107,Patients who received one of the treatments of interest within 48 h of diagnosis were included in one of four treatment groups (chloroquine alone, chloroquine with a macrolide, hydroxychloroquine alone, or hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide), and patients who received none of these treatments formed the control group.
32450107,Patients for whom one of the treatments of interest was initiated more than 48 h after diagnosis or while they were on mechanical ventilation, as well as patients who received remdesivir, were excluded.
32450107,The main outcomes of interest were in-hospital mortality and the occurrence of de-novo ventricular arrhythmias (non-sustained or sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation). 96 032 patients (mean age 53·8 years, 46·3% women) with COVID-19 were hospitalised during the study period and met the inclusion criteria.
32450107,Of these, 14 888 patients were in the treatment groups (1868 received chloroquine, 3783 received chloroquine with a macrolide, 3016 received hydroxychloroquine, and 6221 received hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide) and 81 144 patients were in the control group. 10 698 (11·1%) patients died in hospital.
32450107,After controlling for multiple confounding factors (age, sex, race or ethnicity, body-mass index, underlying cardiovascular disease and its risk factors, diabetes, underlying lung disease, smoking, immunosuppressed condition, and baseline disease severity), when compared with mortality in the control group (9·3%), hydroxychloroquine (18·0%; hazard ratio 1·335, 95% CI 1·223-1·457), hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide (23·8%; 1·447, 1·368-1·531), chloroquine (16·4%; 1·365, 1·218-1·531), and chloroquine with a macrolide (22·2%; 1·368, 1·273-1·469) were each independently associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality.
32450107,Compared with the control group (0·3%), hydroxychloroquine (6·1%; 2·369, 1·935-2·900), hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide (8·1%; 5·106, 4·106-5·983), chloroquine (4·3%; 3·561, 2·760-4·596), and chloroquine with a macrolide (6·5%; 4·011, 3·344-4·812) were independently associated with an increased risk of de-novo ventricular arrhythmia during hospitalisation.
32450107,We were unable to confirm a benefit of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, when used alone or with a macrolide, on in-hospital outcomes for COVID-19.
32450107,Each of these drug regimens was associated with decreased in-hospital survival and an increased frequency of ventricular arrhythmias when used for treatment of COVID-19.

32450198,The chloroquine (CQ) and its analogue hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have been used as frontline drugs for treatment and prophylaxis against all types of human malaria worldwide.
32450198,Since late December 2019, humans have been under threat due to an outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) disease (COVID-19; previously known as 2019-nCoV), since its first reported cases in Wuhan, China [1].
32450198,Consequently, the virus infection has been declared a pandemic.
32450198,While the World is finding expedited approvals for the development of vaccine, which is time dependent, being preventative and not possibly a cure, physicians and countries' leaders are considering several concerted clinical trials suggesting that this age-old antimalarial drug, CQ/HCQ could be a potent therapeutic agent against COVID-19 infection.
32450198,Based on accumulating scientific reports, we have highlighted in this review, the different possible modes of action of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine that could particularly justify its use against viral infections.
32450198,Considering the global health crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic, the option of using the drugs and repurposing of old drugs in this instance, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, specifically, hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 could be the best choice.
32450198,CQ/HCQ has diverse modes of action, like alteration of acidic environment inside lysosome, late endosomes, restriction further with endocytosis, exsosome release, phagolysosomal fusion in systematically and subsequently inhibition of cytokine storm in host cell.
32450198,One or sum of diverse mechanisms might work against the viral infections and help prevent more deaths.
32450198,Given that there is no cure for COVID-19, the clinical testing of HCQ is urgently needed to ascertain its potency against the virus as this is the current available treatment option.
32450198,There is still a need to find other innovative drug candidates as other possible candidate to go into clinical evaluation and testing.
32450344,Patients affected by severe coronavirus induced disease-2019 (Covid-19) often experience hypoxemia due to alveolar involvement and endothelial dysfunction, which leads to the formation of micro thrombi in the pulmonary capillary vessels.
32450344,Both hypoxemia and a prothrombotic diathesis have been associated with more severe disease and increased risk of death.
32450344,To date, specific indications to treat this condition are lacking.
32450344,This was a single center, investigator initiated, compassionate use, proof of concept, case control, phase IIb study (NCT04368377) conducted in the Intermediate Respiratory Care Unit of L.
32450344,Sacco University Hospital in Milano, Italy.
32450344,Our objective was to explore the effects of the administration of anti-platelet therapy on arterial oxygenation and clinical outcomes in patients with severe Covid-19 with hypercoagulability.
32450344,We enrolled five consecutive patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, severe respiratory failure requiring helmet continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and a pro-thrombotic state identified as a D-dimer &gt; 3 times the upper limit of normal.
32450344,Five patients matched for age, D-dimer value and SOFA score formed the control group.
32450344,Beyond standard of care, treated patients received 25 µg/Kg/body weight tirofiban as bolus infusion, followed by a continuous infusion of 0.15 µg/Kg/body weight per minute for 48 hours.
32450344,Before tirofiban, patients received acetylsalicylic acid 250 mg infusion and oral clopidogrel 300 mg; both were continued at a dose of 75 mg daily for 30 days.
32450344,Fondaparinux2.5 mg/day sub-cutaneous was given for the duration of the hospital stay.
32450344,All controls were receiving prophylactic or therapeutic dose heparin, according to local standard operating procedures.
32450344,Treated patients consistently experienced a mean (SD) reduction in A-a O2 gradient of -32.6 mmHg (61.9, P = 0.154), -52.4 mmHg (59.4, P = 0.016) and -151.1 mmHg (56.6, P = 0.011; P = 0.047 vs. controls) at 24, 48 hours and 7 days after treatment.
32450344,PaO2/FiO2 ratio increased by 52 mmHg (50, P = 0.172), 64 mmHg (47, P = 0.040) and 112 mmHg (51, P = 0.036) after 24, 48 hours and 7 days, respectively.
32450344,All patients but one were successfully weaned from CPAP after 3 days.
32450344,This was not true for the control group.
32450344,No major adverse events were observed.
32450344,Antiplatelet therapy might be effective in improving the ventilation/perfusion ratio in Covid-19 patients with severe respiratory failure.
32450344,The effects might be sustained by the prevention and interference on forming clots in lung capillary vessels and by modulating megakaryocytes' function and platelet adhesion.
32450344,Randomized clinical trials are urgently needed to confirm these results.
32450346,Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has sparked a global pandemic, affecting more than 4 million people worldwide.
32450346,The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can cause acute lung injury (ALI) and even acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); with a fatality of 7.0 %.
32450346,Accumulating evidence suggested that the progression of COVID-19 is associated with lymphopenia and excessive inflammation, and a subset of severe cases might exhibit cytokine storm triggered by secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH).
32450346,Furthermore, secondary bacterial infection may contribute to the exacerbation of COVID-19.
32450346,We recommend using both IL-10 and IL-6 as the indicators of cytokine storm, and monitoring the elevation of procalcitonin (PCT) as an alert for initiating antibacterial agents.
32450346,Understanding the dynamic progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucial to determine an effective treatment strategy to reduce the rising mortality of this global pandemic.
32450718,SARS-CoV-2 infection recently reached pandemic proportions, with high risk of death for the worldwide population.
32450718,In this dramatic scenario, all the resources are addressed to the intensive care units for the assessment of the emergency.
32450718,However, more attention should be paid with respect to the risk of viral diffusion among asymptomatic people.
32450718,Italy is the second most involved country in the world, and we needed to gain a lot of experience in a very limited time.
32450718,At least 1 m of distance among people is recommended; however, some clinical practices cannot allow this distance.
32450718,In this context, we believe that the careful safety assessment of clinical settings, like ophthalmologic ones, may have a remarkable impact on the fight against SARS-CoV-2 spread.
32450756,The COVID-19 pandemic has placed a significant personnel burden on intensive care units across the globe.
32450756,Physicians from various specialties, including otolaryngology, have heeded the call and been redeployed to provide support, serving in a capacity outside their usual scope of practice.
32450756,The author shares personal experience from redeployment and provides a framework for otolaryngologists to maximize their impact while providing high-quality patient care and preserving their personal safety.
32450761,During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, patients in intensive care units who are undergoing long-term intubation may require tracheostomy.
32450761,There is controversy about indication and health care professionals' safety regarding the conventional or percutaneous technique.
32450761,We performed a prospective analysis of a series of 27 consecutive patients with COVID-19 comparing both tracheostomy techniques, safety, and prognosis clinical markers.
32450761,The results show that the techniques are equally safe, without cases of infection in surgeons.
32450761,The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score before surgery and the progression in ventilation support during the first 72 hours after tracheostomy are optimal prognostic markers for these patients.
32450787,Patients with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) experience various degrees of liver function abnormalities.
32450787,Liver injury requires extensive work-up and continuous surveillance and can be multifactorial and heterogeneous in nature.
32450787,In the context of COVID-19, clinicians will have to determine whether liver injury is related to an underlying liver disease, drugs used for the treatment of COVID-19, direct effect of the virus, or a complicated disease course.
32450787,Recent studies proposed several theories on potential mechanisms of liver injury in these patients.
32450787,This review summarizes current evidence related to hepatobiliary complications in COVID-19, provides an overview of the available case series and critically elucidates the proposed mechanisms and provides recommendations for clinicians.
32450906,Emerging evidence from China suggests that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is deadlier for infected men than women with a 2.8% fatality rate being reported in Chinese men versus 1.7% in women.
32450906,Further, sex-disaggregated data for COVID-19 in several European countries show a similar number of cases between the sexes, but more severe outcomes in aged men.
32450906,Case fatality is highest in men with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions.
32450906,The mechanisms accounting for the reduced case fatality rate in women are currently unclear but may offer potential to develop novel risk stratification tools and therapeutic options for women and men.
32450906,The present review summarizes latest clinical and epidemiological evidence for gender and sex differences in COVID-19 from Europe and China.
32450906,We discuss potential sex-specific mechanisms modulating the course of disease, such as hormone-regulated expression of genes encoding for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) entry receptors angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 2 receptor and TMPRSS2 as well as sex hormone-driven innate and adaptive immune responses and immunoaging.
32450906,Finally, we elucidate the impact of gender-specific lifestyle, health behavior, psychological stress, and socioeconomic conditions on COVID-19 and discuss sex specific aspects of antiviral therapies.
32450906,The sex and gender disparities observed in COVID-19 vulnerability emphasize the need to better understand the impact of sex and gender on incidence and case fatality of the disease and to tailor treatment according to sex and gender.
32450906,The ongoing and planned prophylactic and therapeutic treatment studies must include prospective sex- and gender-sensitive analyses.
32451259,Since the onset of the new coronavirus pandemic, the world is facing a public health emergency.
32451259,Repositioning hydroxychloroquine (HQ) seems to be a promising option.
32451259,Many emerging evidences have converged on the effectiveness of HQ in the treatment of Covid-19 infection.
32451259,In a recent paper, Gautret et al. suggested that further works are needed to determine if HQ antiviral prophylaxis is useful, especially for healthcare workers.
32451259,The purpose of this paper is to assess the Covid-19 exposure and risks level among caregivers.
32451259,For this, we performed research on internet and PubMed by crossing the following keywords: healthcare givers, healthcare workers, doctors, nurses, coronavirus, Covid-19, mortality, infection rate, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine.
32451259,Data on healthcare worker's infection and mortality by Covid-19 are partial and are not systematically published.
32451259,However, it seems that the infection rate varies between 3.8% and 9% depending on the country.
32451259,Moreover, the mean age of this population is relatively old, especially in the OECD area.
32451259,Anti-Covid-19 HQ prophylaxis should be urgently accessed, especially for healthcare workers.
32451259,It is to be hoped that HQ prophylaxis reduces the morbidity and mortality from Covid-19 infection among this population which is particularly exposed and relatively old.
32451271,The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic.
32451271,It has spread to more than 100 countries, and more than 1 million cases have been confirmed.
32451271,Although coronavirus causes severe respiratory infections in humans, accumulating data have demonstrated cardiac complications and poor outcome in patients with COVID-19.
32451271,A large percent of patients have underlying cardiovascular disease, and they are at a high risk of developing cardiac complications.
32451271,The basics of the virus, the clinical manifestations, and the possible mechanisms of cardiac complications in patients with COVID-19 are reviewed.
32451271,Before an effective vaccine or medicine is available, supportive therapy and identifying patients who are at high risk of cardiac complications are important.
32451343,There is a concern that as a result of COVID-19 there will be a shortage of ventilators for patients requiring respiratory support.
32451343,This concern has resulted in significant debate about whether it is appropriate to withdraw ventilation from one patient in order to provide it to another patient who may benefit more.
32451343,The current advice available to doctors appears to be inconsistent, with some suggesting withdrawal of treatment is more serious than withholding, while others suggest that this distinction should not be made.
32451343,We argue that there is no ethically relevant difference between withdrawing and withholding treatment and that suggesting otherwise may have problematic consequences.
32451343,If doctors are discouraged from withdrawing treatment, concern about a future shortage may make them reluctant to provide ventilation to patients who are unlikely to have a successful outcome.
32451343,This may result in underutilisation of available resources.
32451343,A national policy is urgently required to provide doctors with guidance about how patients should be prioritised to ensure the maximum benefit is derived from limited resources.
32451351,We read with great interest the very thoughtful commentary by Drs.
32451351,Joob and Wiwanitkit.
32451351,We agree with the authors that, despite conflicting clinical data to date, it is possible that HCQ may have a protective effect in the setting of COVID-19.
32451351,More importantly, we agree that optimal HCQ dosage and timing is a critical underpinning for clinical trials.
32451351,However, we highlight several considerations regarding treatment with high dose HCQ.
32451354,We appreciate the interest by Moura and colleague in our editorial regarding the role of the rheumatologist during the Covid-19 pandemic (1).
32451354,The letter by Drs.
32451354,Carlos Antonio Moura and Ana Luísa Cerqueira de Sant'Ana Costa emphasizes the need to understand mechanisms of disease underlying the more serious complications of Covid-19 infection as well as provide the best treatment possible to large numbers of seriously ill patients during a global pandemic (2).
32451655,The current pandemic caused by COVID-19 is the biggest challenge for national health systems for a century.
32451655,While most medical resources are allocated to treat COVID-19 patients, fractures still need to be treated, as some patients with non-deferrable pathologies.
32451655,The aim of this paper is to report the early experience of an integrated team of orthopaedic surgeons during this period.
32451655,This is a mono-geographic, observational, retrospective, descriptive study.
32451655,We collected data from the beginning of the epidemic (1 March 2020), during the pandemic lockdown period (declared in the country on March 16, 2020) until the end of our study period on April 15, 2020.
32451655,All the 140 patients presented to the Emergency Department of the hospital during this period with a diagnosis of fracture, or trauma (sprains, dislocations, wounds) were included in the cohort.
32451655,In addition, 12 patients needing hospitalization for planning a non-deferrable elective surgical treatment were included.
32451655,A group of patients from the two same hospitals and treated during the same period (1<sup>st</sup> March 2018 to April 15, 2018) but previously was used as control.
32451655,Of these 152 patients (mean age 45.5 years; range 1 to 103), 100 underwent a surgical procedure and 52 were managed non-operatively.
32451655,Twenty-eight were children and 124 were adults.
32451655,The COVID-19 diagnosis was confirmed for four patients.
32451655,The frequency of patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis among this population treated in emergency was ten fold higher (2.6%; 4 among 152) than in the general population (0.30%) of the country.
32451655,The mortality rate for patients with surgery was 2% (2 of 100 patients) and 50% (2 of 4) for those older than 60 years with COVID-19; it was null for patients who were managed non-operatively.
32451655,As compared to the year 2018, the number of patients seen with trauma had decreased of 32% during the epidemic.
32451655,Staying home during the COVID-19 pandemic decreased trauma frequency of 32%.
32451655,The structural organization in our hospital allowed us to reduce the time to surgery and ultimately hospital stay, thereby maximizing the already stretched medical resources available to treat all the patients who needed orthopedic care during this period.
32451657,The aim of the current study was to evaluate the impact of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic on musculoskeletal tumor service by conducting an online survey of physicians.
32451657,The survey was conducted among the members of the ISOLS (International Society of Limb Salvage) and the EMSOS (European Musculo-Skeletal Oncology Society).
32451657,The survey consisted of 20 questions (single, multiple-response, ranked): origin and surgical experience of the participant (four questions), potential disruption of healthcare (12 questions), and influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on the particular physician (four questions).
32451657,A matrix with four different response options was created for the particular surgical procedures).
32451657,One hundred forty-nine physicians from five continents completed the survey.
32451657,Of the respondents, 20.1% and 20.7% stated that surgery for life-threatening sarcomas were stopped or delayed, respectively.
32451657,Even when the malignancy was expected to involve infiltration of a neurovascular bundle or fracture of a bone, still 13.8% and 14.7% of the respondents, respectively, stated that surgery was not performed.
32451657,In cases of pending fractures of bone tumors, 37.5 to 46.2% of operations were canceled.
32451657,The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic caused a significant reduction in healthcare (surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy) for malignancies of the musculoskeletal system.
32451657,Delaying or stopping these treatments is life-threatening or can cause severe morbidity, pain, and loss of function.
32451657,Although the coronavirus disease causes severe medical complications, serious collateral damage including death due to delayed or untreated sarcomas should be avoided.
32451736,The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted an important role for drug repurposing.
32451736,Quaternary ammonium compounds such as ammonium chloride, cetylpyridinium and miramistin represent widely accessible antiseptic molecules with well-known broad-spectrum antiviral activities and represent a repurposing opportunity as therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2.
32452539,Months after the outbreak of a new flu-like disease in China, the entire world is now in a state of caution.
32452539,The subsequent less-anticipated propagation of the novel coronavirus disease, formally known as COVID-19, not only made it to headlines by an overwhelmingly high transmission rate and fatality reports, but also raised an alarm for the medical community all around the globe.
32452539,Since the causative agent, SARS-CoV-2, is a recently discovered species, there is no specific medicine for downright treatment of the infection.
32452539,This has led to an unprecedented societal fear of the newly born disease, adding a psychological aspect to the physical manifestation of the virus.
32452539,Herein, the COVID-19 structure, epidemiology, pathogenesis, etiology, diagnosis, and therapy have been reviewed.
32452700,During the COVID-19 pandemic, breast imaging must be performed using safe practices.
32452700,Balancing the need to avoid delays in the diagnosis of breast cancer while avoiding infection requires careful attention to personal protective equipment and physical distancing and vigilance to maintain these practices.
32452700,The Canadian Society of Breast Imaging/Canadian Association of Radiologists guideline for breast imaging during COVID-19 is provided based on priority according to risk of breast cancer and impact of delaying treatment.
32452700,A review of the best practices is presented that allow breast imaging during COVID-19 to maximize protection of patients, technologists, residents, fellows, and radiologists and minimize spread of the infection.
32452700,The collateral damage of delaying diagnosis of breast cancer due to COVID-19 should be avoided when possible.
32452746,To highlight emerging preoperative screening protocols and document workflow challenges and successes during the early weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic.
32452746,This retrospective cohort study was conducted at a large urban tertiary care medical center.
32452746,Thirty-two patients undergoing operative procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic were placed into 2 preoperative screening protocols.
32452746,Early in the pandemic a &quot;high-risk case protocol&quot; was utilized to maximize available resources.
32452746,As information and technology evolved, a &quot;universal point-of-care protocol&quot; was implemented.
32452746,Of 32 patients, 25 were screened prior to surgery.
32452746,Three (12%) tested positive for COVID-19.
32452746,In all 3 cases, the procedure was delayed, and patients were admitted for treatment or discharged under home quarantine.
32452746,During this period, 86% of operative procedures were indicated for treatment of oncologic disease.
32452746,There was no significant delay in arrival to the operating room for patients undergoing point-of-care screening immediately prior to their procedure (<i>P</i> = .92).
32452746,Currently, few studies address preoperative screening for COVID-19.
32452746,A substantial proportion of individuals in this cohort tested positive, and both protocols identified positive cases.
32452746,The major strengths of the point-of-care protocol are ease of administration, avoiding subsequent exposures after testing, and relieving strain on &quot;COVID-19 clinics&quot; or other community testing facilities.
32452746,Preoperative screening is a critical aspect of safe surgical practice in the midst of the widespread pandemic.
32452746,Rapid implementation of universal point-of-care screening is possible without major workflow adjustments or operative delays.
32452838,The epicenter of the COVID-19 crisis since March 17, 2020-the New York metropolitan area-is home to some of the largest Latino immigrant communities in the nation.
32452838,These communities have long faced barriers to health care access, challenges due to immigration status, and financial and labor instability.
32452838,The COVID-19 pandemic has aggravated these existing issues in a vulnerable, often forgotten, immigrant community.
32452838,It is challenging for this population to access public information regarding COVID-19 testing, treatment, and assistance programs because this information is seldom disseminated in Spanish and even less frequently in Portuguese.
32452838,While long-term solutions will require time and changes to policy, some short-term measures can mitigate the current situation.
32452838,The authors share their experience from Newark, New Jersey, where partnerships of public and private community-based organizations (CBOs) have been successful in establishing trust between the health care system and a fearful Latino community.
32452838,The Ironbound Initiative, a student group at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School in Newark, New Jersey, has partnered with Mantena Global Care, a Brazilian CBO in Newark, to facilitate dissemination of COVID-19-relevant information.
32452838,Medical student volunteers, removed from their clinical duties, serve as virtual patient navigators, using social media to reach community members with the goals of improving awareness of precautions to take during the pandemic and of increasing access to needed medical care.
32452838,These students have collaborated with colleagues in other disciplines to provide necessary legal guidance to community members fearful of seeking care because of their immigration status.
32452838,The authors urge other academic institutions across the country to recruit multidisciplinary teams of medical, health professional, and law students invested in their local communities and to empower students to partner with CBOs, immigrant community leaders, faith-based organizations, hospitals, and local authorities to support these vulnerable communities during this crisis.
32452888,To determine mortality rates among adults with critical illness from coronavirus disease 2019.
32452888,Observational cohort study of patients admitted from March 6, 2020, to April 17, 2020.
32452888,Six coronavirus disease 2019 designated ICUs at three hospitals within an academic health center network in Atlanta, Georgia, United States.
32452888,Adults greater than or equal to 18 years old with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV-2 disease who were admitted to an ICU during the study period.
32452888,None.
32452888,Among 217 critically ill patients, mortality for those who required mechanical ventilation was 35.7% (59/165), with 4.8% of patients (8/165) still on the ventilator at the time of this report.
32452888,Overall mortality to date in this critically ill cohort is 30.9% (67/217) and 60.4% (131/217) patients have survived to hospital discharge.
32452888,Mortality was significantly associated with older age, lower body mass index, chronic renal disease, higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, lower PaO2/FIO2 ratio, higher D-dimer, higher C-reactive protein, and receipt of mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, renal replacement therapy, or vasodilator therapy.
32452888,Despite multiple reports of mortality rates exceeding 50% among critically ill adults with coronavirus disease 2019, particularly among those requiring mechanical ventilation, our early experience indicates that many patients survive their critical illness.
32452905,The current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic led to a significant disruption in the care of pain from chronic and subacute conditions.
32452905,The impact of this cessation of pain treatment may have unintended consequences of increased pain, reduced function, increased reliance on opioid medications and potential increased morbidity, due to the systemic impact of untreated disease burden.
32452905,This may include decreased mobility, reduction in overall health status and increase of opioid use with the associated risks.
32452905,The article is the work of the American Society of Pain and Neuroscience (ASPN) COVID-19 Task Force to evaluate the policies set forth by federal, state, and local agencies to reduce or eliminate elective procedures for those patients with pain from spine, nerve and joint disease.
32452905,The impact of these decisions, which were needed to reduce the spread of the pandemic, led to a delay in care for many patients.
32452905,We hence review an emergence plan to reinitiate this pain-related care.
32452905,The goal is to outline a path to work with federal, state, and local authorities to combat the spread of the pandemic and minimize the deleterious impact of pain and suffering on our chronic pain patients.
32452905,The paper sets forth a strategy for the interventional pain centers to reemerge from the current pandemic and to set a course for future events.
32452947,VV ECMO can be utilized as an advanced therapy in select patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure refractory to traditional critical care management and optimal mechanical ventilation.
32452947,Anticipating a need for such therapies during the pandemic, our center created a targeted protocol for ECMO therapy in COVID-19 patients that allows us to provide this life-saving therapy to our sickest patients without overburdening already stretched resources or excessively exposing healthcare staff to infection risk.
32452947,As a major regional referral program, we used the framework of our well-established ECMO service-line to outline specific team structures, modified patient eligibility criteria, cannulation strategies, and management protocols for the COVID-19 ECMO program.
32452947,During the first month of the COVID-19 outbreak in Massachusetts, 6 patients were placed on VV ECMO for refractory hypoxemic respiratory failure.
32452947,The median (interquartile range) age was 47 years (43-53) with most patients being male (83%) and obese (67%).
32452947,All cannulations were performed at the bedside in the intensive care unit in patients who had undergone a trial of rescue therapies for acute respiratory distress syndrome including lung protective ventilation, paralysis, prone positioning, and inhaled nitric oxide.
32452947,At the time of this report, 83% (5/6) of the patients are still alive with 1 death on ECMO, attributed to hemorrhagic stroke. 67% of patients (4/6) have been successfully decannulated, including 2 that have been successfully extubated and one who was discharged from the hospital.
32452947,The median duration of VV ECMO therapy for patients who have been decannulated is 12 days (4-18 days).
32452947,This is 1 the first case series describing VV ECMO outcomes in COVID-19 patients.
32452947,Our initial data suggest that VV ECMO can be successfully utilized in appropriately selected COVID-19 patients with advanced respiratory failure.
32452954,To analyze the impact of COVID-19 emergency on elective oncological surgical activity in Italy.
32452954,COVID-19 emergency shocked national health systems, subtracting resources from treatment of other diseases.
32452954,Its impact on surgical oncology is still to elucidate.
32452954,A 56-question survey regarding the oncological surgical activity in Italy during the COVID-19 emergency was sent to referral centers for hepato-bilio-pancreatic, colorectal, esophago-gastric, and sarcoma/soft-tissue tumors.
32452954,The survey portrays the situation 5 weeks after the first case of secondary transmission in Italy.
32452954,In total, 54 surgical Units in 36 Hospitals completed the survey (95%).
32452954,After COVID-19 emergency, 70% of Units had reduction of hospital beds (median -50%) and 76% of surgical activity (median -50%).
32452954,The number of surgical procedures decreased: 3.8 (interquartile range 2.7-5.4) per week before the emergency versus 2.6 (22-4.4) after (P = 0.036).
32452954,In Lombardy, the most involved district, the number decreased from 3.9 to 2 procedures per week.
32452954,The time interval between multidisciplinary discussion and surgery more than doubled: 7 (6-10) versus 3 (3-4) weeks (P &lt; 0.001).
32452954,Two-third (n = 34) of departments had repeat multidisciplinary discussion of patients.
32452954,The commonest criteria to prioritize surgery were tumor biology (80%), time interval from neoadjuvant therapy (61%), risk of becoming unresectable (57%), and tumor-related symptoms (52%).
32452954,Oncological hub-and-spoke program was planned in 29 departments, but was active only in 10 (19%).
32452954,This survey showed how surgical oncology suffered remarkable reduction of the activity resulting in doubled waiting-list.
32452954,The oncological hub-and-spoke program did not work adequately.
32452954,The reassessment of healthcare systems to better protect the oncological path seems a priority.
32452979,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may lead to a severe inflammatory response referred to as a cytokine storm.
32452979,We describe a case of severe COVID-19 infection in a recently diagnosed pediatric Crohn's disease patient successfully treated with Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α) blockade.
32452979,The patient presented with five days of fever, an erythematous maculopapular facial rash, and abdominal pain without respiratory symptoms.
32452979,SARS-CoV-2 PCR was positive.
32452979,Despite inpatient treatment for COVID-19 and a perianal abscess, the patient acutely decompensated, with worsening fever, tachycardia, fluid-refractory hypotension, elevation of liver enzymes, and transformation of the rash into purpura extending from the face to the trunk, upper and lower extremities, including the palmar and plantar surfaces of the hands and feet.
32452979,Cytokine profile revealed rising levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and TNF-α, higher than those described in either inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or severe COVID-19 alone.
32452979,The patient was treated with infliximab for TNF-α blockade to address both moderately to severely active Crohn's disease and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) temporally related to COVID-19.
32452979,Within hours of infliximab treatment, fever, tachycardia and hypotension resolved.
32452979,Cytokine profile improved with normalization of TNF-α, a decrease in IL-6, and IL-8 concentrations.
32452979,This case supports a role for blockade of TNF-α in the treatment of COVID-19 inflammatory cascade.
32452979,The role of anti-TNF agents in patients with MIS-C temporally related to COVID-19 requires further investigation.
32453656,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had a devastating impact around the world.
32453656,With high rates of transmission and no curative therapies or vaccine yet available, the current cornerstone of management focuses on prevention by social distancing.
32453656,This includes decreased health care contact for patients.
32453656,Patients with lung cancer are a particularly vulnerable population, where the risk of mortality from cancer must now be balanced by the potential risk of a life-threatening infection.
32453656,In these unprecedented times, a collaborative and multidisciplinary approach is required to streamline but not compromise care.
32453656,We have developed guidelines at our academic cancer center to standardize management of patients with lung cancer across our health care system and provide guidance to the larger oncology community.
32453656,We recommend that general principles of lung cancer treatment continue to be followed in most cases where delays could result in rapid cancer progression.
32453656,We recognize that our recommendations may change over time based on clinical resources and the evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic.
32453656,In principle, however, treatment paradigms must continue to be individualized, with careful consideration of risks and benefits of continuing or altering lung cancer-directed therapy.
32453685,We describe 2 cases in coronavirus disease patients in France involving presumed thrombotic stroke that occurred during ongoing anticoagulation treatment for atrial fibrillation stroke prophylaxis; 1 patient had positive antiphospholipid antibodies.
32453685,These cases highlight the severe and unique consequences of coronavirus disease-associated stroke.
32453687,Passive immunotherapy with plasma derived from convalescent patients recovering from SARS-CoV-2 infection can be a promising approach in the treatment of COVID-19 patients.
32453687,It is important that blood establishments are ready to satisfy requests for immune plasma by defining the requirements applicable to plasma donors and the standards for preparation, qualification, storage, distribution, and control of product use.
32453687,This Position paper aims to give recommendations on the biological characteristics of a plasma preparation from convalescent donors and to support the evaluation of this therapeutic approach in more rigorous investigations.
32453702,International data indicate that arterial, venous and microvascular thrombosis or disseminated intravascular coagulation occur in more than 30% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19.
32453702,This condition is characterized by high levels of D-dimer and fibrinogen, prolonged prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time.
32453702,Blood samples from three COVID-19 patients treated in a Hungarian intensive care unit were collected and analyzed with ClotPro® tests.
32453702,EX-tests, IN-test, FIB-tests, RVV-tests, and TPA-tests were performed.
32453702,The results were interpreted with respect to the clinical condition of the patients.
32453702,Procoagulation, hypercoagulation and either fibrinolysis or a &quot;shut down&quot; phenomenon of the fibrinolytic process were found with ClotPro®.
32453702,The ClotPro® parameters were consistent with the conventional coagulation tests and corresponded with the criteria of non-overt disseminated intravascular coagulation.
32453702,These findings encourage further investigations to elucidate the underlying pathophysiology of thromboembolic events in COVID-19 patients and may support the introduction of full dose anticoagulation with or without antiplatelet therapy.
32453702,Interventional clinical trials may be helpful in defining the appropriate drug(s), for this purpose, the algorithms of administration, and the optimal duration of therapy.
32453702,At present, the authorization of a clinical trial that attempts to answer these questions is in progress.

32454090,Fighting the current COVID-19 pandemic, we must not forget to prepare for the next.
32454090,Since elderly and frail people are at high risk, we wish to predict their vulnerability, and intervene if possible.
32454090,For example, it would take little effort to take additional swabs or dried blood spots.
32454090,Such minimally-invasive sampling, exemplified here during screening for potential COVID-19 infection, can yield the data to discover biomarkers to better handle this and the next respiratory disease pandemic.
32454090,Longitudinal outcome data can then be combined with other epidemics and old-age health data, to discover the best biomarkers to predict (i) coping with infection &amp; inflammation and thus hospitalization or intensive care, (ii) long-term health challenges, e.g. deterioration of lung function after intensive care, and (iii) treatment &amp; vaccination response.
32454090,Further, there are universal triggers of old-age morbidity &amp; mortality, and the elimination of senescent cells improved health in pilot studies in idiopathic lung fibrosis &amp; osteoarthritis patients alike.
32454090,Biomarker studies are needed to test the hypothesis that resilience of the elderly during a pandemic can be improved by countering chronic inflammation and/or removing senescent cells.
32454090,Our review suggests that more samples should be taken and saved systematically, following minimum standards, and data be made available, to maximize healthspan &amp; minimize frailty, leading to savings in health care, gains in quality of life, and preparing us better for the next pandemic, all at the same time.
32454157,The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by 2019-nCov/SARS-CoV-2 has become a pandemic with an urgent need for understanding the mechanisms and identifying a treatment.
32454157,Viral infections including SARS-CoV are associated with increased levels of reactive oxygen species, disturbances of Ca<sup>++</sup> caused by unfolded protein response (UPR) mediated by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and is due to the exploitation of virus's own protein i.e., viroporins into the host cells.
32454157,Several clinical trials are on-going including testing Remdesivir (anti-viral), Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine derivatives (anti-malarial drugs) etc.
32454157,Unfortunately, each drug has specific limitations.
32454157,Herein, we review the viral protein involvement to activate ER stress transducers (IRE-1, PERK, ATF-6) and their downstream signals; and evaluate combination therapies for COVID-19 mediated ER stress alterations.
32454157,Melatonin is an immunoregulator, anti-pyretic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and ER stress modulator during viral infections.
32454157,It enhances protective mechanisms for respiratory tract disorders.
32454157,Andrographolide, isolated from Andrographis paniculata, has versatile biological activities including immunomodulation and determining SARS-CoV-2 binding site.
32454157,Considering the properties of both compounds in terms of anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-pyrogenic, anti-viral and ER stress modulation and computational approaches revealing andrographolide docks with the SARS-CoV2 binding site, we predict that this combination therapy may have potential utility against COVID-19.
32454184,The COVID-19 pandemic has led to high numbers of critically ill and dying patients in need of expert management of dyspnea, delirium, and serious illness communication.
32454184,The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 creates surges of infected patients requiring hospitalization and puts palliative care programs at risk of being overwhelmed by patients, families, and clinicians seeking help.
32454184,In response to this unprecedented need for palliative care, our program sought to create a collection of palliative care resources for non-palliative care clinicians.
32454184,A workgroup of interdisciplinary palliative care clinicians developed the Palliative Care Toolkit, consisting of a detailed chapter in a COVID-19 online resource, a mobile and desktop web application, one-page guides, pocket cards, and communication skills training videos.
32454184,The suite of resources provides expert and evidence-based guidance on symptom management including dyspnea, pain, and delirium, and also on serious illness communication, including conversations about goals of care, code status, and end-of-life.
32454184,We also created a nurse resource hotline staffed by palliative care nurse practitioners and virtual office hours staffed by a palliative care attending physician.
32454184,Since its development, the Toolkit has helped us disseminate best practices to non-palliative care clinicians delivering primary palliative care, allowing our team to focus on the highest-need consults, and increasing acceptance of palliative care across hospital settings.
32454186,As healthcare institutions mobilize resources to address the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, palliative care may potentially be underutilized.
32454186,It is important to assess the use of palliative care in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
32454186,This is a retrospective single center study of patients with COVID-19 diagnosed via reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay (RT-PCR) admitted between 3/1/2020 and 4/24/2020.
32454186,An analysis of the utilization of palliative care in accordance with patient comorbidities and other characteristics was performed while considering clinical outcomes.
32454186,Chi square test was used to determine associations between categorical variables while T tests were used to compare continuous variables.
32454186,The overall mortality rate was 21.5% (n=52) and in 48% (n=25) of these patients, palliative care was not involved.
32454186,Fifty nine percent (n=24) of those who had palliative consults eventually elected for comfort measures and transitioned to hospice care.
32454186,Among those classified as having severe COVID-19, only 40% (n=31) had palliative care involvement.
32454186,Of these patients with severe COVID-19, 68% (n=52) died.
32454186,Patients who got palliative care consults were of older age, had higher rates of intubation, need for vasopressors, and death.
32454186,There was a low utilization rate of palliative care in patients with COVID-19.
32454186,Conscious utilization of palliative care is needed at the time of COVID-19.
32454187,As COVID-19 cases continue to rise globally, evidence from large randomised controlled trials is still lacking.
32454187,Currently, numerous trials testing potential treatment and preventative options are undertaken all over the world.
32454187,We summarised all registered clinical trials examining treatment and prevention options for COVID-19.
32454187,Additionally, we evaluated the quality of the retrieved studies.
32454187,Clinicaltrials.gov, the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry and the European Union Clinical Trials Register were systematically searched.
32454187,Registered clinical trials examining treatment and/or prevention options for COVID-19 were included.
32454187,No language, country or study design restrictions were applied.
32454187,We excluded withdrawn or cancelled studies and trials not reporting therapeutic or preventative strategies for COVID-19. and interventions: No restrictions in terms of participants' age and medical background or type of intervention were enforced.
32454187,The registries were searched using the term &quot;coronavirus&quot; or &quot;COVID-19&quot; from their inception until 26<sup>th</sup> March 2020.
32454187,Additional manual search of the registries was also performed.
32454187,Eligible studies were summarised and tabulated.
32454187,Interventional trials were methodologically analysed, excluding expanded access studies and trials testing Traditional Chinese Medicine.
32454187,In total, 309 trials evaluating therapeutic management options, 23 studies assessing preventive strategies and 3 studies examining both were retrieved.
32454187,Finally, 214 studies were methodologically reviewed.
32454187,Interventional treatment studies were mostly randomised (n=150, 76%) and open-label (n=73, 37%) with a median number of planned inclusions of 90 (IQR 40-200).
32454187,Major categories of interventions that are currently being investigated are discussed.
32454187,Numerous clinical trials have been registered since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.
32454187,Summarised data on these trials will assist physicians and researchers to promote patient care and guide future research efforts for COVID-19 pandemic containment.
32454253,During the COVID-19 pandemic, surgical departments were forced to re-schedule their activity giving priority to urgent procedures and non-deferrable oncological cases.
32454253,There is a lack of evidence-based literature providing clinical and organizational guidelines for the management of a general surgery department.
32454253,Aim of our study was to review the available recommendations published by general Surgery Societies and Health Institutions and evaluate the underlying Literature.
32454253,A review of the English Literature was conducted according to the AMSTAR and to the 2009 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines.
32454253,After eligibility assessment, a total of 22 papers and statements were analyzed.
32454253,Surgical societies have established criteria for triage and prioritization in order to identify procedures that can be postponed after the pandemic and those that should not.
32454253,Prioritization among oncologic cases represents a difficult task: clinicians have to balance a possible delay in cancer diagnosis or treatment against the risk for a potential COVID-19 exposure.
32454253,There is broad agreement among guidelines that indication to proceed with surgery should be discussed in virtual Tumor Boards taking into consideration alternative therapeutic approaches.
32454253,Several guidelines deal with the role of laparoscopic surgery during the pandemic: a tailored approach is currently suggested, with a case-by-case evaluation provided that appropriate personal protective equipment is available in order to minimize the potential risk of transmission.
32454253,Finally, there is a considerable agreement in the published Literature concerning the management of the personnel during the peri- and intraoperative phase and on the technical advices regarding the induction, operative and recover maneuvers in COVID-19 cases.
32454253,During COVID-19 pandemic, it is of paramount importance to face the emergency in the most effective and efficient manner, retrieving resources from non-essential settings and, at the same time, providing care to high priority non-COVID-19 related diseases.
32454500,Critically ill COVID-19 patients are generally admitted to the ICU for respiratory insufficiency which can evolve into a multiple-organ dysfunction syndrome requiring extracorporeal organ support.
32454500,Ongoing advances in technology and science and progress in information technology support the development of integrated multi-organ support platforms for personalized treatment according to the changing needs of the patient.
32454500,Based on pathophysiological derangements observed in COVID-19 patients, a rationale emerges for sequential extracorporeal therapies designed to remove inflammatory mediators and support different organ systems.
32454500,In the absence of vaccines or direct therapy for COVID-19, extracorporeal therapies could represent an option to prevent organ failure and improve survival.
32454500,The enormous demand in care for COVID-19 patients requires an immediate response from the scientific community.
32454500,Thus, a detailed review of the available technology is provided by experts followed by a series of recommendation based on current experience and opinions, while waiting for generation of robust evidence from trials.
32454512,An outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)<sup>1-3</sup>, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)<sup>4</sup> spread globally.
32454512,Countermeasures are needed to treat and prevent further dissemination of the virus.
32454512,In this study, we report the isolation of 2 specific human monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) from a convalescent COVID-19 patient.
32454512,CA1 and CB6 demonstrated potent SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralization activity in vitro against SARS-CoV-2.
32454512,In addition, CB6 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in rhesus monkeys at both prophylactic and treatment settings.
32454512,Further structural studies revealed that CB6 recognizes an epitope that overlaps with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-binding sites in SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD), thereby interfering with the virus/receptor interactions by both steric hindrance and direct interface-residue competition.
32454512,Our results suggest CB6 deserves further clinical translation.
32454888,The Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an acute respiratory infectious disease.
32454888,At present, COVID-19 has no specific therapeutic drugs, and the main clinical treatment is symptomatic treatment and control of complications.
32454888,On March 5, 2020, the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China issued the <i>Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Novel Coronavirus</i> (<i>2019</i>-<i>nCoV</i>) <i>Infection</i> (<i>Trial Version 7</i>), which integrated traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) into the treatment of COVID-19.
32454888,The purpose of this study is to summarize recent studies on the clinic application, pharmacological action, chemical substances and mechanism of Qingwen Baidu Decoction (QBD) on the treatment of various diseases.
32454888,The results suggested that QBD has multiple pharmacological effects such as anti-inflammation, antiviral, antibacterial, immunomodulatory, antipyretic and so on.
32454888,It has been used in the treatment of sepsis, epidemic hemorrhagic fever, epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis, infantile pneumonia, sepsis-related encephalopathy, epidemic encephalitis B and other diseases.
32454888,In addition, this study attempts to explore the possible mechanism of QBD in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.
32454888,Through the analysis of the chemical substances, pharmacological action and mechanism of QBD, this paper will provide a reference theoretical basis for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 by QBD.
32454982,Amid <b>COVID</b>-<b>19</b> Crisis, reporting adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and medical device incidents (MDIs) to Health Canada or health authorities in every country is crucial for monitoring medication safety and improving public health.
32454982,Health Canada, for example, through their online database, has facilitated the process of reporting side effects relating to drugs and medical devices.
32454982,However, several patients and health care professionals still fail to voluntarily report adverse events.
32454982,For health care providers, some barriers to reporting may include fear of negative feedback, apathy, legal concerns, and uncertainty about whether an incident qualifies as an ADR.
32454982,In the current <b>COVID-19</b> Crisis, it is especially important for health care providers to be diligent about reporting Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs), since misinformation propagated by the media is causing patients to misuse certain medications.
32454982,We need to shift the current thought process about ADR reporting in order to encourage a positive reporting culture by patients and health care providers.
32454983,Background Coronavirus is causing a shortage of critical inhalers needed by patients with Asthma and respiratory illness.
32454983,Patients with Asthma are at higher risk if they tract the novel Coronavirus.
32454983,As the coronavirus continues to spread, hospitals are turning to use more salbutamol MDI.
32454983,Salbutamol MDI has become the line of defence for physicians in the emergency room who are treating patients with Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and have respiratory distress .[
32454983,Hui et al 2020 ,and Center for Drug Evaluation and Research 2020] During the COVID pandemic, there has been a drastic increase in the use of MDI inhalers; therefore, it led to a decrease in availability and a break in the supply chain.
32454983,Patients with Asthma are at higher risk if they tract the novel Coronavirus, and an inhaler could be a life or death for them.
32454983,As the coronavirus continues to spread, hospitals are turning to use more salbutamol Metered Dose inhaler (MDI).
32454983,Salbutamol MDI is now on short supply as the COVID-19 continues to spread.
32454983,Salbutamol MDI has become the line of defence for physicians in the emergency room who are treating patients with COVID-19 and have respiratory distress.
32454983,The current shortage of salbutamol MDI could be a result of stockpiling and hoarding of this life-saving inhaler.
32454983,That had led to a critical shortage of Salbutamol MDI, and even the case shortage continues with some other alternatives such as Ipratropium MDI and even with long-acting B-agonists such as Salmeterol and Formoterol which also starting to have a limitation on ordering these agents.
32454983,Coronavirus sparks fear of medication shortage.
32454983,Coronavirus panic-buying also may have led to a shortage of critical inhalers.
32454983,We have also got elderly patients with COPD who may need Ventolin MDI and also premature babies who may have caught Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and need salbutamol MDI to support their lungs have since been compromised, and they rely heavily on Asthma inhalers.
32454983,Finding a safe and creative strategy is essential during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32454984,Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has reached pandemic proportions.
32454984,Most of the drugs that are being tried for the treatment have not been evaluated in any randomized controlled trials.
32454984,The purpose of this review was to summarize the in-vitro and in-vivo efficacy of these drugs on Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) and related viruses (SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) and evaluate their potential for re-purposing them in the management of COVID-19.
32455090,The recent outbreak of COVID-19 has put significant strain on the current health system and has exposed dangers previously overlooked.
32455090,The pathogen known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2), is notable for attacking the pulmonary system causing acute respiratory distress, but it can also severely affect other systems in at-risk individuals including cardiovascular compromise, gastrointestinal distress, acute kidney injury, coagulopathies, cutaneous manifestations, and ultimately death from multi-organ failure.
32455090,Unfortunately, the reliability of negative test results is questionable and the high infectious burden of the virus calls for extended safety precautions, especially in symptomatic patients.
32455090,We present a confirmed COVID-19 case that was transferred to our burn center for concern of Steven Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN) overlap syndrome after having two negative confirmatory COVID-19 tests at an outside hospital.
32455090,A 58-year-old female with a history of morbid obesity, HTN, gout, CML managed with imatinib, and chronic kidney disease presented as a transfer from a community hospital to our burn center.
32455090,The patient was admitted to her community hospital with febrile, acute respiratory distress.
32455090,Imaging and clinical presentation was consistent with COVID-19 and lab tests for the pathogen were ordered.
32455090,During observation, while waiting for results, she was placed under patient under investigation (PUI) protocol.
32455090,Once negative results were obtained, the PUI protocol was abandoned despite ongoing symptoms.
32455090,Subsequently, dermatological symptoms developed and transfer to our burn center was initiated.
32455090,After a second negative test result, the symptomatic patient was transferred to our burn center for expert wound management.
32455090,Given the lack of resolve of respiratory symptoms and concern for the burn patient population, the patient was placed in PUI protocol and an internal COVID-19 was ordered.
32455090,The patient's initial exam under standard COVID-19 airborne precautions revealed 5% total body surface area of loss of epidermis affecting bilateral thighs, bilateral arms, and face.
32455090,A dermatopathological biopsy suggested a bullous drug reaction with an erythema multiform-like reaction pattern versus SJS/TEN.
32455090,Moreover, the internal COVID-19 test returned positive.
32455090,The delayed positive test results and complicated hospital course with our patient required us to scale back and notify every patient and staff member whom they came in contact with, across multiple institutions.
32455090,We suggest that whenever a suspected COVID-19 patient is transferred to a specialized center, they should be isolated and re-checked before joining the new patient population for treatment of the unique condition.
32455168,The need for life-saving interventions such as mechanical ventilation may threaten to outstrip resources during the Covid-19 pandemic.
32455168,Allocation of these resources to those most likely to benefit can be supported by clinical prediction models.
32455168,The ethical and practical considerations relevant to predictions supporting decisions about microallocation are distinct from those that inform shared decision-making in ways important for model design.
32455168,We review three issues of importance for microallocation: (1) Prediction of benefit (or of medical futility) may be technically very challenging; (2) When resources are scarce, calibration is less important for microallocation than is ranking to prioritize patients, since capacity determines thresholds for resource utilization; (3) The concept of group fairness, which is not germane in shared decision-making, is of central importance in microallocation.
32455168,Therefore, model transparency is important.
32455168,Prediction supporting allocation of life-saving interventions should be explicit, data-driven, frequently updated and open to public scrutiny.
32455168,This implies a preference for simple, easily understood and easily applied prognostic models.
32455475,SARS-CoV-2 poses new challenges in all aspects of healthcare.
32455475,Patients with preexisting cardio-vascular conditions are at higher risk of developing severe symptoms and worse outcome.
32455475,Data also suggest that cancer patients are particularly vulnerable, but differences between tumor entities and cancer treatments may exist.
32455475,Little is known how cancer treatment engaging immune checkpoints affects the course of COVID-19.
32455478,We read with interest the article by Recalcati et al. about the report of cutaneous manifestations in COVID-19 patients.
32455478,We would like to highlight that some potentially severe manifestations in these patients are not directly related to the coronavirus but to the medications administered.
32455515,<b>Objective:</b> To analyse the clinical history, laboratory tests and pathological data of a patient who suffered from novel coronavirus pneumonia(COVID-19) and provide reference for the clinical treatment of similar cases. <b>Methods:</b> Data of clinical manifestation, laboratory examination, bronchoscopy, echocardiography and cardiopulmonary pathological results were retrospectively reviewed in a case of COVID-19 with rapid exacerbation from mild to critical condition. <b>Results:</b> This patient hospitalized at day 9 post 2019 novel coronavirus(2019-nCoV) infection, experienced progressive deterioration from mild to severe at day 11, severe to critical at day 18 and underwent extracorporeal membrane oxygenation(ECMO) and continuous renal replacement therapy(CRRT) as well as heart lung transplantation during day 28-45 day post infection, and died on the second day post heart and lung transplantation.
32455515,The patient had suffered from hypertension for 8 years.
32455515,At the early stage of the disease, his symptoms were mild and the inflammatory indices increased and the lymphocyte count decreased continuously.
32455515,The patient's condition exacerbated rapidly with multi-organ infections, and eventually developed pulmonary hemorrhage and consolidation, pulmonary hypertension, right heart failure, malignant ventricular arrhythmias, liver dysfunction, etc.
32455515,His clinical manifestations could not be improved despite viral RNAs test results became negative.
32455515,The patient underwent lung and heart transplantation and finally died of multi organ failure at the second day post lung and heart transplantation.
32455515,Pathological examination indicated massive mucus, dark red secretions and blood clots in bronchus.
32455515,The pathological changes were mainly diffused pulmonary hemorrhagic injuries and necrosis, fibrosis, small vessel disease with cardiac edema and lymphocyte infiltration. <b>Conclusions:</b> The clinical course of COVID-19 can exacerbate rapidly from mild to critical with lung, liver and heart injuries.
32455515,Steadily increased inflammation indices are suggestive of irreversible disease progression and worse outcome.
32455515,In the early stages of the disease, the progress of the disease should be closely observed and evaluated, and the factors related to the progress of the disease should be identified and managed. <b>目的：</b> 分析新型冠状病毒肺炎（COVID-19）患者的临床资料和心肺病理特征，为类似病例的临床救治提供借鉴。
32455515,<b>方法：</b> 回顾性分析1例COVID-19患者从发病到危重型快速进展过程中的临床指标、实验室检查、支气管镜及超声心动图结果的动态变化和心肺病理解剖结果。
32455515,<b>结果：</b> 该例患者在新型冠状病毒（2019-nCoV）感染后第9天入院。
32455515,患者起病后从轻症到重症，再到危重症分别经历了11和18 d，在第28至45天期间接受了体外膜肺氧合（ECMO）联合连续性肾脏替代疗法（CRRT）以及心肺联合移植术，术后第二天死亡。
32455515,患者有8年高血压病史。
32455515,早期症状轻，炎症指标升高、淋巴细胞减少。
32455515,治疗效果差，病情进展迅速，多次病毒核酸检测转阴之后病情仍加重，并逐渐发展为肺出血和实变，大量分泌物和肺内出血导致肺功能丧失、肺动脉高压、右心衰竭、恶性心律失常及肝功能异常。
32455515,予右肺移植和原位心脏移植术后不能维持循环稳定而死亡。
32455515,肺病理检查可见气管及支气管内存在大量粘液、暗红色分泌物和血块，病理改变主要为肺组织出血坏死、肺泡炎、纤维素性渗出和小血管病变，心肌细胞水肿和少量炎症细胞浸润。
32455515,<b>结论：</b> COVID-19危重型患者从轻症到危重症、死亡进展快速，危重症阶段发生肺、心和肝脏损伤，逐渐升高的炎症指标预示着不可逆的病情恶化及预后不良。
32455515,提示在疾病早期应严密观察并评估病情进展，识别及处理与病情进展相关的因素。.
32455534,The rapid outbreak of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China followed by its spread around the world poses a serious global concern for public health.
32455534,To this date, no specific drugs or vaccines are available to treat SARS-CoV-2 despite its close relation to the SARS-CoV virus that caused a similar epidemic in 2003.
32455534,Thus, there remains an urgent need for the identification and development of specific antiviral therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2.
32455534,To conquer viral infections, the inhibition of proteases essential for proteolytic processing of viral polyproteins is a conventional therapeutic strategy.
32455534,In order to find novel inhibitors, we computationally screened a compound library of over 606 million compounds for binding at the recently solved crystal structure of the main protease (M<sup>pro</sup>) of SARS-CoV-2.
32455534,A screening of such a vast chemical space for SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> inhibitors has not been reported before.
32455534,After shape screening, two docking protocols were applied followed by the determination of molecular descriptors relevant for pharmacokinetics to narrow down the number of initial hits.
32455534,Next, molecular dynamics simulations were conducted to validate the stability of docked binding modes and comprehensively quantify ligand binding energies.
32455534,After evaluation of potential off-target binding, we report a list of 12 purchasable compounds, with binding affinity to the target protease that is predicted to be more favorable than that of the cocrystallized peptidomimetic compound.
32455534,In order to quickly advise ongoing therapeutic intervention for patients, we evaluated approved antiviral drugs and other protease inhibitors to provide a list of nine compounds for drug repurposing.
32455534,Furthermore, we identified the natural compounds (-)-taxifolin and rhamnetin as potential inhibitors of M<sup>pro</sup>.
32455534,Rhamnetin is already commercially available in pharmacies.
32455629,Genes required for SARS-CoV-2 entry into human cells, ACE2 and FURIN, were employed as baits to build genomic-guided molecular maps of upstream regulatory elements, their expression and functions in the human body, and pathophysiologically relevant cell types.
32455629,Repressors and activators of the ACE2 and FURIN genes were identified based on the analyses of gene silencing and overexpression experiments as well as relevant transgenic mouse models.
32455629,Panels of repressors (<i>VDR; GATA5; SFTPC; HIF1a</i>) and activators (<i>HMGA2; INSIG1; RUNX1; HNF4a; JNK1/c-FOS</i>) were then employed to identify existing drugs manifesting in their effects on gene expression signatures of potential coronavirus infection mitigation agents.
32455629,Using this strategy, vitamin D and quercetin have been identified as putative 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) mitigation agents.
32455629,Quercetin has been identified as one of top-scoring candidate therapeutics in the supercomputer SUMMIT drug-docking screen and Gene Set Enrichment Analyses (GSEA) of expression profiling experiments (EPEs), indicating that highly structurally similar quercetin, luteolin, and eriodictyol could serve as scaffolds for the development of efficient inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32455629,In agreement with this notion, quercetin alters the expression of 98 of 332 (30%) of human genes encoding protein targets of SARS-CoV-2, thus potentially interfering with functions of 23 of 27 (85%) of the SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins in human cells.
32455629,Similarly, Vitamin D may interfere with functions of 19 of 27 (70%) of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins by altering expression of 84 of 332 (25%) of human genes encoding protein targets of SARS-CoV-2.
32455629,Considering the potential effects of both quercetin and vitamin D, the inference could be made that functions of 25 of 27 (93%) of SARS-CoV-2 proteins in human cells may be altered.
32455629,GSEA and EPEs identify multiple drugs, smoking, and many disease conditions that appear to act as putative coronavirus infection-promoting agents.
32455629,Discordant patterns of testosterone versus estradiol impacts on SARS-CoV-2 targets suggest a plausible molecular explanation of the apparently higher male mortality during the coronavirus pandemic.
32455629,Estradiol, in contrast with testosterone, affects the expression of the majority of human genes (203 of 332; 61%) encoding SARS-CoV-2 targets, thus potentially interfering with functions of 26 of 27 SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins.
32455629,A hypothetical tripartite combination consisting of quercetin/vitamin D/estradiol may affect expression of 244 of 332 (73%) human genes encoding SARS-CoV-2 targets.
32455629,Of major concern is the ACE2 and FURIN expression in many human cells and tissues, including immune cells, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may infect a broad range of cellular targets in the human body.
32455629,Infection of immune cells may cause immunosuppression, long-term persistence of the virus, and spread of the virus to secondary targets.
32455629,Present analyses and numerous observational studies indicate that age-associated vitamin D deficiency may contribute to the high mortality of older adults and the elderly.
32455629,Immediate availability for targeted experimental and clinical interrogations of potential COVID-19 pandemic mitigation agents, namely vitamin D and quercetin, as well as of the highly selective (Ki, 600 pm) intrinsically specific FURIN inhibitor (a1-antitrypsin Portland (a1-PDX), is considered an encouraging factor.
32455629,Observations reported in this contribution are intended to facilitate follow-up targeted experimental studies and, if warranted, randomized clinical trials to identify and validate therapeutically viable interventions to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.
32455629,Specifically, gene expression profiles of vitamin D and quercetin activities and their established safety records as over-the-counter medicinal substances strongly argue that they may represent viable candidates for further considerations of their potential utility as COVID-19 pandemic mitigation agents.
32455629,In line with the results of present analyses, a randomized interventional clinical trial evaluating effects of estradiol on severity of the coronavirus infection in COVID19+ and presumptive COVID19+ patients and two interventional randomized clinical trials evaluating effects of vitamin D on prevention and treatment of COVID-19 were listed on the ClinicalTrials.gov website.
32455777,In response to the 2008 economic and financial crisis and to its effects on healthcare systems, dental care has become unaffordable for many people, and a huge number of patients worldwide are avoiding or skipping necessary dental treatments [...].
32455894,The recent novel coronavirus, named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has developed into an international pandemic affecting millions of individuals with hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide.
32455894,The highly infectious nature and widespread prevalence of this disease create a new set of obstacles for the bladder cancer community in both delivering and receiving care.
32455894,In this manuscript, we address the unique issues regarding treatment prioritization for the patient with bladder cancer and how we at City of Hope have adjusted our clinical practices using a team-based approach that utilizes shared decision making with all stakeholders (physicians, patients, caregivers) to optimize outcomes during this difficult time.
32455894,In addition to taking standard precautions for minimizing COVID-19 risk of exposure for those entering a healthcare facility (screening all personnel upon entry and donning facemasks at all times), we suggest the following three measures: (1) delay post-treatment surveillance visits until there is a decrease in local COVID-19 cases, (2) continue curative intent treatments for localized bladder cancer with COVID-19 precautions (i.e., choosing gemcitabine/cisplatin (GC) over dose-dense methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, cisplatin (ddMVAC) neoadjuvant chemotherapy), and (3) increase the off-treatment period between cycles of palliative systemic therapy in metastatic urothelial carcinoma patients.
32455961,COVID-19 is a highly infectious respiratory disease which leads to several clinical conditions related to the dysfunction of the respiratory system along with other physical and psychological complaints.
32455961,Severely affected patients are referred to intensive care units (ICUs), limiting their possibilities for physical exercise.
32455961,Whole body vibration (WBV) exercise is a non-invasive, physical therapy, that has been suggested as part of the procedures involved with pulmonary rehabilitation, even in ICU settings.
32455961,Therefore, in the current review, the World Association of Vibration Exercise Experts (WAVEX) reviewed the potential of WBV exercise as a useful and safe intervention for the management of infected individuals with COVID-19 by mitigating the inactivity-related declines in physical condition and reducing the time in ICU.
32455961,Recommendations regarding the reduction of fatigue and the risk of dyspnea, the improvement of the inflammatory and redox status favoring cellular homeostasis and the overall improvement in the quality of life are provided.
32455961,Finally, practical applications for the use of this paradigm leading to a better prognosis in bed bound and ICU-bound subjects is proposed.
32456064,Patients with diabetes have been reported to have enhanced susceptibility to severe or fatal COVID-19 infections, including a high risk of being admitted to intensive care units with respiratory failure and septic complications.
32456064,Given the global prevalence of diabetes, affecting over 450 million people worldwide and still on the rise, the emerging COVID-19 crisis poses a serious threat to an extremely large vulnerable population.
32456064,However, the broad heterogeneity and complexity of this dysmetabolic condition, with reference to etiologic mechanisms, degree of glycemic derangement and comorbid associations, along with the extensive sexual dimorphism in immune responses, can hamper any patient generalization.
32456064,Even more relevant, and irrespective of glucose-lowering activities, DPP4 inhibitors and GLP1 receptor agonists may have a favorable impact on the modulation of viral entry and overproduction of inflammatory cytokines during COVID-19 infection, although current evidence is limited and not univocal.
32456064,Conversely, SGLT2 inhibitors may increase the likelihood of COVID-19-related ketoacidosis decompensation among patients with severe insulin deficiency.
32456064,Mindful of their widespread popularity in the management of diabetes, addressing potential benefits and harms of novel antidiabetic drugs to clinical prognosis at the time of a COVID-19 pandemic deserves careful consideration.
32456123,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused a worldwide outbreak of respiratory illness.
32456123,This review aims to evaluate the effectiveness and adverse events of herbal medicines for the treatment of COVID-19.
32456123,Twelve databases were searched through 12 May 2020.
32456123,Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs assessing the effects of herbal medicines for the treatment of COVID-19 were eligible.
32456123,The study selection and data extraction were performed by two independent reviewers.
32456123,The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used for the assessment of the risk of bias in all included RCTs.
32456123,Mean differences (MDs), risk ratios (RRs) and odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated, and the effect sizes of the studies were pooled.
32456123,Seven RCTs with a total of 855 patients were included.
32456123,All included trials compared the combined therapy of herbal medicine with Western medicine to Western medicine alone.
32456123,The combined therapy significantly improved the total effective rate (RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.34, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), cough symptom disappearance rate (RR 1.45, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.89, <i>p</i> = 0.005), and sputum production symptom disappearance rate (RR 1.73, 95% CI 1.19 to 2.50, <i>p</i> = 0.004).
32456123,Beneficial effects of the combined therapy were also seen in TCM syndrome score of cough (MD -1.18, 95% CI -1.34 to -1.03, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), fever (MD -0.62, 95% CI -0.79 to -0.45, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), dry and sore throat (MD -0.83, 95% CI -1.45 to -0.20, <i>p</i> = 0.009), and fatigue (MD -0.60, 95% CI -1.04 to -0.17, <i>p</i> = 0.007).
32456123,The overall risk of bias of the included studies was unclear.
32456123,No serious adverse events were reported.
32456123,Significant effects of the combined therapy of herbal medicine with Western medicine were found, and revealed the potential role of herbal medicine in treating COVID-19.
32456123,More high-quality RCTs are needed to further validate the effectiveness and adverse events of herbal medicine in the treatment of COVID-19.
32456286,Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a viral disease with a high morbidity and mortality by the FIP virus (FIPV, virulent feline coronavirus).
32456286,Several antiviral drugs for FIP have been identified, but many of these are expensive and not available in veterinary medicine.
32456286,Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is a drug approved by several countries to treat malaria and immune-mediated diseases in humans, and its antiviral effects on other viral infections (e.g., SARS-CoV-2, dengue virus) have been confirmed.
32456286,We investigated whether HCQ in association with interferon-ω (IFN-ω) is effective for FIPV in vitro.
32456286,A total of 100 μM of HCQ significantly inhibited the replication of types I and II FIPV.
32456286,Interestingly, the combination of 100 μM of HCQ and 10<sup>4</sup> U/mL of recombinant feline IFN-ω (rfIFN-ω, veterinary registered drug) increased its antiviral activity against type I FIPV infection.
32456286,Our study suggested that HCQ and rfIFN-ω are applicable for treatment of FIP.
32456286,Further clinical studies are needed to verify the combination of HCQ and rIFN-ω will be effective and safe treatment for cats with FIP.
32456368,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global public health emergency threatening people's lives around the world.
32456368,Although the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) induced by COVID-19 is similar to the ARDS caused by other diseases in terms of pathophysiological basis and clinical manifestations, they are also different in many aspects, which lead to different clinical therapies.
32456368,Therefore, understanding the differences and similarities of ARDS induced by COVID-19 and other diseases currently are the basis for clinicians to make decisions for the treatment of COVID-19 induced ARDS.
32456368,新型冠状病毒肺炎(COVID－19)已成为全球公共卫生事件，对全球人民生命安全构成极大的威胁。
32456368,而COVID－19导致的急性呼吸窘迫综合征(ARDS)与其他疾病导致的ARDS在病理生理基础、临床表现等方面有相同的地方，但也有很大的区别，从而导致临床治疗的差异。
32456368,因此，了解COVID－19导致的ARDS与其他病因导致ARDS的异同，是目前临床医师对COVID－19导致的ARDS进行临床决策的基础。.
32456753,The COVID-19 pandemic is a rapidly evolving phenomenon that presents serious practical challenges and complex clinical considerations for health care workers, health care administrators, and policy formulators. <i>The Senior Care Pharmacist</i> carries periodic updates addressing matters relevant to pharmacotherapeutics and pharmacy practice as these relate to the care of older people in the time of the pandemic.
32456753,The brief news items that are provided here are not intended to be substitutes for a careful and comprehensive consideration of the issues involved, but rather, they serve to provide initial awareness of concepts and to stimulate more complete situational analysis.
32456948,A novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused pneumonia, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), broke out in Wuhan, China in December 2019, and spread all over the world.
32456948,Patients with COVID-19 showed huge differences in the hospital stay, progression, and prognosis.
32456948,As reported, the comorbidities may play an important role in COVID-19.
32456948,Here, we aim to address the role of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the progression and prognosis of COVID-19.
32456948,Eighty-three confirmed COVID-19 patients were divided into CVD (n = 42) and non-CVD (n = 41) group according to their medical history.
32456948,Medical records including demographic data, medical history, clinical characteristics, laboratory examinations, chest computed tomography (CT), and treatment measures were collected, analyzed, and compared between the two groups.
32456948,COVID-19 patients with CVD showed (1) more severe pathological changes in the lungs, (2) elevated injury-related enzymes including α-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (HDBH), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT), creatine kinase (CK), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), (3) significantly increased uncontrolled inflammation related markers, such as c-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-6, serum ferritin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and serum amyloid A (SAA), (4) serious hypercoagulable status reflected by increased D-dimer and serum fibrinogen (FIB), and (5) higher mortality, compared to COVID-19 patients without CVD.
32456948,Our data indicated that CVD is a strong risk factor for rapid progression and bad prognosis of COVID-19.
32456948,More intensive medical care should be applied to patients with CVD to prevent rapid deterioration of the disease.
32457036,COVID-19 pandemic challenges health system capacities in many countries.
32457036,National healthcare services have to manage unexpected shortage of healthcare resources that have to be reallocated according to the principles of fair and ethical prioritisation, in order to maintain the highest levels of care to all patients, ensure the safety of patients and healthcare workers and save as many lives as possible.
32457036,Beyond that, cancer care services have to pursue restructuring, following the same evidence-based dispositions.
32457036,In this article, we propose guidance to the management of colorectal cancer during the pandemic, prioritised according to a three-tiered framework, based on expert clinical judgement and magnitude of benefit expected from specific interventions.
32457036,Since the availability of resources for diagnostic procedures, surgery and postoperative care, systemic therapy and radiotherapy may differ, authors did separate prioritisation analyses.
32457036,The impact of postponing or abrogating cancer interventions on outcomes according to a high, medium or low priority scale, is outlined and discussed.
32457036,The implementation of healthcare services using telemedicine is explored: it reveals itself as functional and effective for limiting patients' need to travel to centres and thereby has the potential to reduce diffusion of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.
32457036,Colorectal cancer demands a considerable amount of medical resources.
32457036,Therefore, the redefinition of its diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms with a rigorous method is crucial in order to ensure the highest quality of continuum of care in the broader context of the pandemic and the challenged healthcare systems.
32457038,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in the death of more than 328,000 persons worldwide in the first 5 months of 2020.
32457038,Herculean efforts to rapidly design and produce vaccines and other antiviral interventions are ongoing.
32457038,However, newly evolving viral mutations, the prospect of only temporary immunity, and a long path to regulatory approval pose significant challenges and call for a common, readily available and inexpensive treatment.
32457038,Strategic drug repurposing combined with rapid testing of established molecular targets could provide a pause in disease progression.
32457038,SARS-CoV-2 shares extensive structural and functional conservation with SARS-CoV-1 including engagement of the same host cell receptor (ACE2) localized in cholesterol-rich microdomains.
32457038,These lipid-enveloped viruses encounter the endosomal/lysosomal host compartment in a critical step of infection and maturation.
32457038,Niemann-Pick type C (NP-C) disease is a rare, monogenic neurodegenerative disease caused by deficient efflux of lipids from the late endosome/lysosome (LE/L).
32457038,The NP-C disease-causing gene (NPC1) has been strongly associated with viral infection, as a filovirus receptor (e.g., Ebola) and through LE/L lipid trafficking.
32457038,This suggests NPC1 inhibitors or NP-C disease mimetics could serve as anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents.
32457038,Fortunately, there are such clinically approved molecules that elicit antiviral activity in pre-clinical studies, without causing NP-C disease.
32457038,Inhibition of NPC1 may impair viral SARS-CoV-2 infectivity via several lipid-dependent mechanisms, which disturb the microenvironment optimum for viral infectivity.
32457038,We suggest that known mechanistic information on NPC1 could be utilized to identify existing and future drugs to treat COVID-19.
32457048,To investigate differences in manifestations and outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection between those with and without rheumatic disease.
32457048,We conducted a comparative cohort study of patients with rheumatic disease and COVID-19 (confirmed by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 PCR), compared in a 1:2 ratio with matched comparators on age, sex and date of COVID-19 diagnosis, between 1 March and 8 April 2020, at Partners HealthCare System in the greater Boston, Massachusetts area.
32457048,We examined differences in demographics, clinical features and outcomes of COVID-19 infection.
32457048,The main outcomes were hospitalisation, intensive care admission, mechanical ventilation and mortality.
32457048,We identified 52 rheumatic disease patients with COVID-19 (mean age, 63 years; 69% female) and matched these to 104 non-rheumatic disease comparators.
32457048,The majority (39, 75%) of patients with rheumatic disease were on immunosuppressive medications.
32457048,Patients with and without rheumatic disease had similar symptoms and laboratory findings.
32457048,A similar proportion of patients with and without rheumatic disease were hospitalised (23 (44%) vs 42 (40%)), p=0.50) but those with rheumatic disease required intensive care admission and mechanical ventilation more often (11 (48%) vs 7 (18%), multivariable OR 3.11 (95% CI 1.07 to 9.05)).
32457048,Mortality was similar between the two groups (3 (6%) vs 4 (4%), p=0.69).
32457048,Patients with rheumatic disease and COVID-19 infection were more likely to require mechanical ventilation but had similar clinical features and hospitalisation rates as those without rheumatic disease.
32457048,These findings have important implications for patients with rheumatic disease but require further validation.
32457086,During the Covid-19 pandemic, a strategy to minimise face-to-face (FtF) visits and limit viral spread is essential.
32457086,Video consultations offer clinical assessment despite restricted movement of people.We undertook a rapid literature review to identify the highest currently available level of evidence to inform this major change in clinical practice.
32457086,We present a narrative synthesis of the one international and one national guideline and two systematic reviews-all published within the last 18 months.The global evidence appears to support video consultations as an effective, accessible, acceptable and cost-effective method of service delivery.
32457086,Organisations must ensure software is simple, effective, reliable and safe, with the highest level of security for confidentiality.Although video consultations cannot fully replace FtF, they can radically reduce the need for FtF and the risk of Covid-19 spread in our communities while maintaining high standards of care.
32457086,For patient safety, it will be critical to follow the WHO guidance regarding: a standard operating procedure; clinical protocols for when video consultations can (and cannot) be used; policies to ensure equity of access in disadvantaged populations; adequate staff training; and administrative support to coordinate appointments.
32457133,COVID-19 is impacting provision of renal transplantation in the UK with a reduction in clinical activity.
32457133,Publicly available Renal Registry and NHS Blood and Transplant reports were analysed to model the number of missed transplant opportunities, waiting list size and change in dialysis population over a six-month period starting 5 March 2020.
32457133,An estimated 1,670 kidney transplant opportunities may be lost, which will lead to 6,317 active patients on the kidney-alone waiting list, compared to 4,649 based on usual activity estimates.
32457133,This will result in 1,324 additional patients on dialysis who would otherwise have been transplanted.
32457133,COVID-19 will lead to a marked loss of transplant opportunities and a significantly larger national waiting list.
32457133,The existing strain on dialysis capacity will be exacerbated as patients remain on dialysis as the only available form of renal replacement therapy.
32457133,These findings will help inform policy and service specific strategies.
32457227,To describe a novel case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-associated acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE) in a patient with aplastic anemia where there was early brain stem-predominant involvement.
32457227,Evaluation of cause, clinical symptoms, and treatment response.
32457227,A 59-year-old woman with a background of transfusion-dependent aplastic anemia presented with seizures and reduced level of consciousness 10 days after the onset of subjective fever, cough, and headache.
32457227,Nasopharyngeal swab testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was positive, and CT during admission demonstrated diffuse swelling of the brain stem.
32457227,She required intubation and mechanical ventilation for airway protection, given her reduced level of consciousness.
32457227,The patient's condition deteriorated, and MRI on day 6 demonstrated worsening brain stem swelling with symmetrical hemorrhagic lesions in the brain stem, amygdalae, putamina, and thalamic nuclei.
32457227,Appearances were consistent with hemorrhagic ANE with early brain stem involvement.
32457227,The patient showed no response to steroid therapy and died on the eighth day of admission.
32457227,COVID-19 may be associated with an acute severe encephalopathy and, in this case, was considered most likely to represent an immune-mediated phenomenon.
32457227,As the pandemic continues, we anticipate that the spectrum of neurologic presentation will broaden.
32457227,It will be important to delineate the full clinical range of emergent COVID-19-related neurologic disease.
32457932,The media have featured the antimalarials chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) to treat coronavirus (COVID-19).
32457932,Political leaders have touted their use and recommended availability to the public.
32457932,These anti-inflammatory agents have substantial human toxicity with a narrow therapeutic window.
32457932,CQ and HCQ poisoning cause myocardial depression and profound hypotension due to vasodilation.
32457932,Bradycardia and ventricular escape rhythms arise from impaired myocardial automaticity and conductivity due to sodium and potassium channel blockade.
32457932,With cardiotoxicity, ECGs may show widened QRS, atrioventricular heart block and QT interval prolongation.
32457932,CQ may also cause seizures, often refractory to standard treatment.
32457932,Of concern is pediatric poisoning, where 1-2 pills of CQ or HCQ can cause serious and potentially fatal toxicity in a toddler.
32457932,The treatment of CQ/HCQ poisoning includes high-dose intravenous diazepam postulated to have positive ionotropic and antidysrhythmic properties that may antagonize the cardiotoxic effects of CQ.
32457932,Infusions of epinephrine titrated to treat unstable hypotension, as well as potassium for severe hypokalemia may be required.
32457932,Current scientific evidence does not support treatment or prophylactic use of these agents for COVID-19 disease.
32457932,Regulatory and public health authorities recognize that CQ/HCQ may offer little clinical benefit and only add risk requiring further investigation before wider public distribution.
32458019,As the novel coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) spreads, a decrease in the number of patients with acute appendicitis (AA) has been noted in our institutions.
32458019,The aim of this study was to compare the incidence and severity of AA before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32458019,A retrospective cohort analysis was performed between December 2019 and April 2020 in the four high-volume centres that provide health care to the municipality of Jerusalem, Israel.
32458019,Two groups were created.
32458019,Group A consisted of patients who presented in the 7 weeks prior to COVID-19 first being diagnosed, whilst those in the 7 weeks after were allocated to Group B.
32458019,A comparison was performed between the clinicopathological features of the patients in each group as was the changing incidence of AA.
32458019,A total of 378 patients were identified, 237 in Group A and 141 in Group B (62.7% vs.
32458019,37.3%).
32458019,Following the onset of COVID-19, the weekly incidence of AA decreased by 40.7% (p = 0.02).
32458019,There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of the length of preoperative symptoms or surgery, need for postoperative peritoneal drainage or the distribution of complicated versus uncomplicated appendicitis.
32458019,The significant decrease in the number of patients admitted with AA during the onset of COVID-19 possibly represents successful resolution of mild appendicitis treated symptomatically by patients at home.
32458019,Further research is needed to corroborate this assumption and identify those patients who may benefit from this treatment pathway.
32458021,Acute kidney injury (AKI) requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT) is common in critically ill patients with COVID-19.
32458021,Unparalleled numbers of patients with AKI and shortage of dialysis machines and operative resources prompted consideration of expanded use of urgent-start peritoneal dialysis (PD) and evaluation of the safety and efficacy of bedside surgical placement of PD catheters.
32458021,Bedside, open PD catheter insertions were performed in early April 2020, at a large academic center in New York City.
32458021,Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and AKI and ambulatory patients with chronic kidney disease and impending need for RRT were included.
32458021,Detailed surgical technique is described.
32458021,Fourteen catheters were placed at the bedside over 2 weeks, 11 in critically ill COVID-19 patients and three in ambulatory patients.
32458021,Mean patient age was 61.9 years (43-83), and mean body mass index was 27.1 (20-37.6); four patients had prior abdominal surgery.
32458021,All catheters were placed successfully without routine radiographic studies or intraoperative complications.
32458021,One patient (7%) experienced primary nonfunction of the catheter requiring HD.
32458021,One patient had limited intraperitoneal bleeding while anticoagulated, which was managed by mechanical compression of the abdominal wall and temporarily holding anticoagulation.
32458021,All other catheters had an adequate function at 3-18 days of follow-up.
32458021,Bedside placement of PD catheters is safe and effective in ICU and outpatient clinic settings.
32458021,Our surgical protocols allowed for optimization of critical hospital resources, minimization of hazardous exposure to healthcare providers and a broader application of urgent-start PD in selected patients.
32458021,Long-term follow-up is warranted.
32458121,The indications and timing for tracheostomy in patients with SARS CoV2-related are controversial.
32458121,In a recent issue published in the European Archives of Otorhinolaryngology, Mattioli et al. published a short communication about tracheostomy timing in patients with COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019); they reported that the tracheostomy could allow early Intensive Care Units discharge and, in the context of prolonged Invasive Mechanical Ventilation, should be suggested within 7 and 14 days to avoid potential tracheal damages.
32458121,In this Letter to the Editor we would like to present our experience with tracheostomy in a Hub Covid Hospital. 8 patients underwent open tracheostomy in case of intubation prolonged over 14 days, bronchopulmonary overlap infections, and patients undergoing weaning.
32458121,They were followed up and the number and timing of death were recorded.
32458121,Two patients died after tracheostomy; the median time between tracheostomy and death was 3 days.
32458121,A negative prognostic trend was observed for a shorter duration of intubation.
32458121,In our experience, tracheostomy does not seem to influence the clinical course and prognosis of the disease, in the face of possible risks of contagion for healthcare workers.
32458121,The indication for tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients should be carefully evaluated and reserved for selected patients.
32458121,Although it is not possible to define an optimal timing, it is our opinion that tracheostomy in a stable or clinically improved COVID-19 patient should not be proposed before the 20th day after orotracheal intubation.
32458149,The current COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has prompted investigators worldwide to search for an effective anti-viral treatment.
32458149,A number of anti-viral drugs such as ribavirin, remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, antibiotics such as azithromycin and doxycycline, and anti-parasite such as ivermectin have been recommended for COVID-19 treatment.
32458149,In addition, sufficient pre-clinical rationale and evidence have been presented to use chloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19.
32458149,Furthermore, Zn has the ability to enhance innate and adaptive immunity in the course of a viral infection.
32458149,Besides, Zn supplement can favour COVID-19 treatment using those suggested and/or recommended drugs.
32458149,Again, the effectiveness of Zn can be enhanced by using chloroquine as an ionophore while Zn inside the infected cell can stop SARS-CoV-2 replication.
32458149,Given those benefits, this perspective paper describes how and why Zn could be given due consideration as a complement to the prescribed treatment of COVID-19.
32458150,The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has revolutionized global healthcare in an unprecedented way and with unimaginable repercussions.
32458150,Resource reallocation, socioeconomic confinement and reorganization of production activities are current challenges being faced both at the national and international levels, in a frame of uncertainty and fear.
32458150,Hospitals have been restructured to provide the best care to COVID-19 patients while adopting preventive strategies not to spread the infection among healthcare providers and patients affected by other diseases.
32458150,As a consequence, the concept of urgency and indications for elective treatments have been profoundly reshaped.
32458150,In addition, several providers have been recruited in COVID-19 departments despite their original occupation, resulting in a profound rearrangement of both inpatient and outpatient care.
32458150,Orthopaedic daily practice has been significantly affected by the pandemic.
32458150,Surgical indications have been reformulated, with elective cases being promptly postponed and urgent interventions requiring exceptional attention, especially in suspected or COVID-19<sup>+</sup> patients.
32458150,This has made a strong impact on inpatient management, with the need of a dedicated staff, patient isolation and restrictive visiting hour policies.
32458150,On the other hand, outpatient visits have been limited to reduce contacts between patients and the hospital personnel, with considerable consequences on post-operative quality of care and the human side of medical practice.In this review, we aim to analyze the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the orthopaedic practice.
32458150,Particular attention will be dedicated to opportune surgical indication, perioperative care and safe management of both inpatients and outpatients, also considering repercussions of the pandemic on resident education and ethical implications.
32458206,Of huge importance now is to provide a fast, cost-effective, safe, and immediately available pharmaceutical solution to curb the rapid global spread of SARS-CoV-2.
32458206,Recent publications on SARS-CoV-2 have brought attention to the possible benefit of chloroquine in the treatment of patients infected by SARS-CoV-2.
32458206,Whether chloroquine can treat SARS-CoV-2 alone and also work as a prophylactic is doubtful.
32458206,An effective prophylactic medication to prevent viral entry has to contain, at least, either a protease inhibitor or a competitive virus ACE2-binding inhibitor.
32458206,Using bromhexine at a dosage that selectively inhibits TMPRSS2 and, in so doing, inhibits TMPRSS2-specific viral entry is likely to be effective against SARS-CoV-2.
32458206,We propose the use of bromhexine as a prophylactic and treatment.
32458206,We encourage the scientific community to assess bromhexine clinically as a prophylactic and curative treatment.
32458206,If proven to be effective, this would allow a rapid, accessible, and cost-effective application worldwide.
32458279,Remdesivir is one of the most promising drugs to treat COVID-19 based on the following facts: remdesivir has a broad-spectrum antiviral mechanism of action; it demonstrated in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 and in vivo efficacy in animal models against the similar coronavirus MERS-CoV; its safety profile has been tested in Ebola patients and in compassionate use in COVID-19 patients.
32458279,Currently, remdesivir is being investigated in ten randomized controlled trials against COVID-19.
32458279,The dose regimen of remdesivir is an IV loading dose of 200 mg on day 1 followed by daily IV maintenance doses of 100 mg for 5-9 days.
32458279,Based on our data analysis, however, remdesivir with IV administration alone is unlikely to achieve excellent clinical efficacy.
32458279,This analysis is based on the following observations: plasma exposures of remdesivir and its active metabolite are unlikely to be correlated with its clinical efficacy; remdesivir and its active metabolites are unlikely to be adequate in the lung to kill the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
32458279,Even if remdesivir demonstrates benefits in the current randomized controlled trials, its efficacy may be limited.
32458279,We suggest that a combination of an IV and pulmonary delivery dose regimen should be studied immediately to realize a potentially more effective antiviral therapy against COVID-19.
32458279,Graphical abstract.
32458356,The early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic have focused on containing SARS-CoV-2 infection and identifying treatment strategies.
32458356,While controlling this communicable disease is of utmost importance, the long-term effect on individuals with non-communicable diseases (NCD) is significant.
32458356,Although certain NCDs appear to increase the severity of COVID-19 and mortality risk, SARS-CoV-2 infection in survivors with NCDs may also affect the progression of their pre-existing clinical conditions.
32458356,Infection containment measures will have substantial short- and long-term consequences; social distancing and quarantine restrictions will reduce physical activity and increase other unhealthy lifestyles, thus increasing NCD risk factors and worsening clinical symptoms.
32458356,Vitamin D levels might decrease and there might be a rise in mental health disorders.
32458356,Many countries have made changes to routine management of NCD patients, e.g., cancelling non-urgent outpatient visits, which will have important implications for NCD management, diagnosis of new-onset NCDs, medication adherence, and NCD progression.
32458356,We may have opportunities to learn from this unprecedented crisis on how to leverage healthcare technologies and improve procedures to optimize healthcare service provision.
32458356,This article discusses how the COVID-19 outbreak and related infection control measures could hit the most frail individuals, worsening the condition of NCD patients, while further jeopardizing the sustainability of the healthcare systems.
32458356,We suggest ways to define an integrated strategy that could involve both public institutional entities and the private sector to safeguard frail individuals and mitigate the impact of the outbreak.
32458370,Many healthcare resources have been and continue to be allocated to the management of patients with COVID-19.
32458370,Therefore, the ongoing care of patients receiving oral anticoagulation with warfarin is likely to be compromised amid this unprecedented crisis.
32458370,This article discusses a stepwise algorithm for the management of outpatient warfarin therapy.
32458370,Alternative management strategies are presented and discussed, including alternative pharmacological therapy options and self-monitoring.
32458370,Our algorithm aims to help clinicians safely optimize the treatment of patients requiring anticoagulation therapy in the context of the global response to the current pandemic.
32458488,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has challenged healthcare systems around the world.
32458488,Unfortunately, failure has ensued: high-income countries have succumbed to the global emergency despite highly prepared human and technological assets.
32458488,There is no current consensus on pharmacological management of COVID-19, but chloroquine phosphate (CQ) has emerged as a possible therapeutical candidate.
32458488,However, no conclusive evidence has been published on the efficacy of CQ against SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32458488,The Colombian government has approved the use of CQ for COVID-19, a measure that could negatively impact a large number of patients who depend on this drug for the treatment of other life-threatening diseases such as malaria and rheumatic autoimmune diseases.
32458488,Careful consideration should be taken by Colombian authorities regarding the use of CQ in context of the ongoing pandemic.

32458502,SARS-CoV-2 is highly infectious, and infection by this virus results in COVID-19, manifesting predominantly respiratory symptoms in the lower respiratory system.
32458502,Detection of viral genomic materials by RT-PCR is the gold standard for diagnosis.
32458502,Suspected COVID-19 patients who had a documented history of exposure and exhibited symptoms, but did not have positive PCR test results, were generally self-quarantined with prescriptions aiming to help attenuate their symptoms.
32458502,These prescriptions are however neither specific nor highly effective for COVID-19 treatment.
32458502,Given the rapidly growing pandemic and overwhelmed medical system, the number of self-quarantined patients is increasing.
32458502,There is an urgent need of alternative medicine to help patients relieve symptoms during self-quarantine, and to potentially help increase their chances of survival and recovery from the infection.
32458502,We report here a case of COVID-19 that never had a positive PCR test result during disease progression but was confirmed with antibody test post recovery.
32458502,This patient was self-quarantined and received diammonium glycyrrhizinate, a steroid-like molecule, in combination with Vitamin C as alternative medicine.
32458502,This patient went through severe COVID-19 but eventually recovered upon the implementation of this treatment regimen, suggesting potential therapeutic effects of diammonium glycyrrhizinate as alternative medicine to help relieve COVID-19 symptoms.

32458530,Immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory therapies are important in dermatology, but indications are influenced by SARS-CoV-2.
32458530,We will focus on are skin disorders such as autoimmune connective tissue disorders, neutrophilic dermatoses and vasculitis.
32458530,Immunomodulators such as colchicine and antimalarials can easily be preferred taking their beneficial effects on Covid-19 into consideration and also given their wide spectrum of action.
32458530,Among the conventional therapies, methotrexate, azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil increase the risk of infection, and thus their use is recommended only when necessary and at low doses.
32458530,On the other hand, use of cyclosporine is also not recommended as it increases the risk of hypertension, which is susceptible to Covid-19.
32458530,Anti-TNF agents from among the biological therapies appear to be slightly risky in terms of susceptibility to infection.
32458530,However, there are ongoing studies which suggest that some biological treatments may reduce cytokine storm impeding the Covid-19 progression as a result, in spite of their susceptibilities to Covid-19.
32458530,Patients, who will be started on immunosuppressive therapy, should be tested for Covid-19 prior to the therapy, and in the event that Covid-19 is suspected, the therapy should be discontinued.

32458536,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is responsible for at least 2,546,527 cases and 175,812 deaths as of April 21, 2020.
32458536,Psoriasis and atopic dermatitis are common, chronic, inflammatory skin conditions, with immune dysregulation as a shared mechanism; therefore, mainstays of treatment include systemic immunomodulating therapies.
32458536,It is unknown whether these therapies are associated with increased to COVID-19 susceptibility or worse outcomes in infected patients.
32458536,In this review, we discuss overall infection risks of non-biologic and biologic systemic medications for psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, and provide therapeutic recommendations.
32458536,In summary, in patients with active infection, systemic conventional medications, the JAK inhibitor tofacitinib, and biologics for psoriasis should be temporarily held until there is more data; in uninfected patients switching to safer alternatives should be considered.
32458536,Interleukin (IL)-17, IL-12/23 and IL-23 inhibitors are associated with low infection risk, with IL-17 and IL-23 favored over IL-12/23 inhibitors.
32458536,Pivotal trials and postmarketing data also suggest that IL-17 and IL-23 blockers are safer than TNF-blockers.
32458536,Apremilast, acitretin and dupilumab, have favorable safety data, and may be safely initiated and continued in uninfected patients.
32458536,Without definitive COVID-19 data, these recommendations may be useful in guiding treatment of psoriasis and atopic dermatitis patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.

32458588,Because of the COVID-19 emergency, on March 9, 2020 Italy went in lock-down imposing the closure of non-urgent outpatient clinics devoted to care of chronic, severe, inflammatory skin diseases that require periodic follow-up.
32458588,In this emergency situation, due to the lack of a teledermatology platform and in order not to leave our vulnerable high-need patients without proper follow-up, we started a teledermatologic service in smartworking using phone calls and emails.
32458588,The total number of patients scheduled was 195; in 12 cases we were not able to talk to the patients.
32458588,Remote monitoring was performed in 183 patients (126 moderate to severe psoriasis, 10 severe acne, 11 severe atopic dermatitis, 11 hidradenitis suppurativa, 9 blistering autoimmune diseases, 16 other autoimmune skin diseases).
32458588,During remote-visits several interventions were conducted: triage for COVID-19 suspected symptoms, email check of clinical pictures and of laboratory examinations, advices for topical and systemic therapy continuation or discontinuation/switch and re-schedule of next appointment.
32458588,Only 5 patients required personal office visit (2.6%), reducing consistently the number of face-to face visits.
32458588,Our real-life experience shows that remote monitoring was effective in preventing unnecessary worsening of severe chronic skin diseases and poor outcomes due to withdrawal of current therapy.

32458596,The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has rapidly spread globally.
32458596,Cancer patients are at a higher risk of being infected with the coronavirus and are more likely to develop severe complications, as compared to the general population.
32458596,The increasing spread of COVID-19 presents challenges for the clinical care of patients with gynecological malignancies.
32458596,Concerted efforts should be put into managing gynecological malignancies in an orderly manner by strictly implementing the measures that are specifically developed for controlling the spread of COVID-19.
32458596,We have drafted <i>Recommendations on Management of Gynecological Malignancies during the COVID-19 Pandemic</i> based on our experience on controlling COVID-19 pandemic in China.
32458596,We recommend that patients with gynecological malignancies should be managed in hierarchical and individualized manners in combination with local conditions related to COVID-19.
32458596,Medical care decision should be balanced between controlling COVID-19 pandemic spread and timely diagnosis and treatment for gynecologic oncology patients.
32458597,The World Health Organization (WHO) classified the novel coronavirus (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]) as a global public health emergency.
32458597,COVID-19 threatens to curtail patient access to evidence-based treatment.
32458597,Medicine is changing, basically due to the limited available resources.
32458597,In the field of gynecologic oncology, we have to re-design our treatments' paradigm.
32458597,During COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, the highest priority is to achieve the maximum benefit from less demanding procedures.
32458597,Extensive procedures should be avoided, in order to reduce hospitalization and postoperative events that might increase the in-hospital spread of the virus.
32458597,There are ongoing concerns on the use of laparoscopic procedures, related to the possible contamination of the staff working in the operation room.
32458597,Other minimally invasive techniques, including, vaginal surgery as well as robotic-assisted and isobaric procedures would be preferred over laparoscopy.
32458597,A fair allocation of resources is paramount adequate treatments.
32458599,A novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was identified in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China by the end of 2019, and then, the disease spread across China and became a global pandemic.
32458599,Nevertheless, there are no effective treatments or vaccines for COVID-19 until now.
32458599,In addition to the treatment of patients with COVID-19, the China Medical Treatment Expert Group for COVID-19 is active to study and screen effective antiviral drugs, and has found that chloroquine, an old antimalarial,shows activity against SARS-CoV-2.
32458599,Then, chloroquine was included in the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 in China (version 6) issued by National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
32458599,Currently, chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine sulfate, two chloroquine derivatives, are under clinical use.
32458599,Although these two agents exhibit similar mechanisms of drug actions, there is a difference between these two chemicals in terms of target populations, therapeutic efficacy and adverse reactions.
32458599,This paper summarizes the currently available data and experiences from clinical treatment for malaria with chloroquine drugs, so as to provide insights into the more rational use of chloroquine agents for the treatment of COVID-19. <b>［摘要］</b> 2019 年底, 我国湖北省武汉市出现了新型冠状病毒肺炎 疫情, 随后在全国扩散并成为全球大流行。
32458599,由于尚无针对新型冠 状病毒的特效治疗药物和疫苗, 我国新型冠状病毒感染救治临床 专家团队在救治新型冠状病毒感染患者的同时, 积极研究和筛选 有效抗病毒治疗药物, 发现一种古老的抗疟药——氯喹有一定抗 新型冠状病毒效果, 随后纳入我国新型冠状病毒肺炎诊疗方案。
32458599,目前, 临床应用的是氯喹衍生物磷酸氯喹和硫酸羟氯喹, 这两种药物虽药理机制相近, 但其治疗对象、疗效和不良反应均存在一定差异。
32458599,本文拟通过对氯喹类药物已有研究和在疟疾临床治疗 中的经验总结, 为我国临床专家更科学合理地使用氯喹类药物进 行新型冠状病毒肺炎治疗提供参考。.
32458694,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), having gradually developed into a pandemic and endangered global health.
32458694,The continued use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) which are part of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors in COVID-19 patients with hypertension has become controversial.
32458694,We conducted a meta-analysis by searching Pubmed, Web of Science, Scopus and Embase up to 13 May 2020.
32458694,Data analyses were performed by the Cochrane Collaboration's Review Manager 5.3 software.
32458694,Finally, we included 9 studies comprising 3936 patients with hypertension and COVID-19 infection.
32458694,Compared with non-ACEI/ARB treatment, ACEI/ARB treatment was not associated with disease severity (OR 0.71, 95 % CI 0.46-1.08, P 0.11, I<sup>2</sup> 59%) but was related to lower mortality of COVID-19 in patients with hypertension (OR 0.57, 95 % CI 0.38-0.84, P 0.004, I<sup>2</sup> 0).
32458694,In summary, ACEI/ARB therapy did not aggravate disease severity of COVID-19.
32458694,Besides, ACEI/ARB therapy can decrease the mortality of COVID-19.
32458694,Current evidence suggested that RAAS inhibitors should be continued in COVID-19 patients with hypertension.
32458694,Future well-designed randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings.
32458969,More than 1.6 million Americans have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and &gt;10 times that number carry antibodies to it.
32458969,High-risk patients presenting with progressing symptomatic disease have only hospitalization treatment with its high mortality.
32458969,An outpatient treatment that prevents hospitalization is desperately needed.
32458969,Two candidate medications have been widely discussed: remdesivir, and hydroxychloroquine+azithromycin.
32458969,Remdesivir has shown mild effectiveness in hospitalized inpatients, but no trials have been registered in outpatients.
32458969,Hydroxychloroquine+azithromycin has been widely misrepresented in both clinical reports and public media, and outpatient trials results are not expected until September.
32458969,Early outpatient illness is very different than later hospitalized florid disease and the treatments differ.
32458969,Evidence about use of hydroxychloroquine alone, or of hydroxychloroquine+azithromycin in inpatients, is irrelevant concerning efficacy of the pair in early high-risk outpatient disease.
32458969,Five studies, including two controlled clinical trials, have demonstrated significant major outpatient treatment efficacy.
32458969,Hydroxychloroquine+azithromycin has been used as standard-of-care in more than 300,000 older adults with multicomorbidities, with estimated proportion diagnosed with cardiac arrhythmias attributable to the medications 47/100,000 users, of which estimated mortality is &lt;20%, 9/100,000 users, compared to the 10,000 Americans now dying each week.
32458969,These medications need to be widely available and promoted immediately for physicians to prescribe.
32459061,The novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has changed health care, challenged by resource constraints and fears of transmission.
32459061,We report the surgical practice pattern changes in a Head and Neck Surgery department of a tertiary cancer care center and discuss the issues surrounding multidisciplinary care during the pandemic.
32459061,We report data regarding outpatient visits, multidisciplinary treatment planning conference, surgical caseload, and modifications of oncologic therapy during this pandemic and compared this data to the same interval last year.
32459061,We found a 46.7% decrease in outpatient visits and a 46.8% decrease in surgical caseload, compared to 2019.
32459061,We discuss the factors involved in the decision-making process and perioperative considerations.
32459061,Surgical practice patterns in head and neck oncologic surgery will continue to change with the evolving pandemic.
32459061,Despite constraints, we strive to prioritize and balance the oncologic and safety needs of patients with head and neck cancer in the face of COVID-19.
32459123,SARS-CoV-2 was identified as the causative pathogen in an outbreak of viral pneumonia cases originating in Wuhan, China, with an ensuing rapid global spread that led it to be declared a pandemic by the WHO on March 11, 2020.
32459123,Given the threat to public health posed by sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the literature surrounding patient presentation in severe and non-severe cases, transmission rates and routes, management strategies, and initial clinical trial results have become available at an unprecedented pace.
32459123,In this review we collate current clinical and immunologic reports, comparing these to reports of previous coronaviruses to identify mechanisms driving progression to severe disease in some patients.
32459123,In brief, we propose a model wherein dysregulated type I interferon signalling leads to aberrant recruitment and accumulation of innate immune lineages in the lung, impairing establishment of productive adaptive responses, and permitting a pathologic pro-inflammatory state.
32459123,Finally, we extend these findings to suggest possible treatment options that may merit investigation in randomized clinical trials.
32459144,The outbreak of viral pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 that began in December 2019 caused high mortality.
32459144,It has been suggested that the main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 may be an important target to discover pharmaceutical compounds for the therapy of this life-threatening disease.
32459144,Remdesivir, ritonavir and chloroquine have all been reported to play a role in suppressing SARS-CoV-2.
32459144,Here, we applied a molecular docking method to study the binding stability of these drugs with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.
32459144,It appeared that the ligand-protein binding stability of the alliin and SARS-CoV-2 Mpro complex was better than others.
32459144,The results suggested that alliin may serve as a good candidate as an inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.
32459144,Therefore, the present research may provide some meaningful guidance for the prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
32459192,The global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has presented major challenges for clinical laboratories, from initial diagnosis to patient monitoring and treatment.
32459192,Initial response to this pandemic involved the development, production, and distribution of diagnostic molecular assays at an unprecedented rate, leading to minimal validation requirements and concerns regarding their diagnostic accuracy in clinical settings.
32459192,In addition to molecular testing, serological assays to detect antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are now becoming available from numerous diagnostic manufacturers.
32459192,In both cases, the lack of peer-reviewed data and regulatory oversight, combined with general misconceptions regarding their appropriate use, have highlighted the importance of laboratory professionals in robustly validating and evaluating these assays for appropriate clinical use.
32459192,The International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) Task Force on COVID-19 has been established to synthesize up-to-date information on the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and laboratory diagnosis and monitoring of COVID-19, as well as to develop practical recommendations on the use of molecular, serological, and biochemical tests in disease diagnosis and management.
32459192,This review summarizes the latest evidence and status of molecular, serological, and biochemical testing in COVID-19 and highlights some key considerations for clinical laboratories operating to support the global fight against this ongoing pandemic.
32459192,Confidently this consolidated information provides a useful resource to laboratories and a reminder of the laboratory's critical role as the world battles this unprecedented crisis.
32459372,Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers are extensively used worldwide to treat many cardiovascular disorders, where they are effective in reducing both mortality and morbidity.
32459372,These drugs are known to induce an increased expression of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2).
32459372,ACE2 acts as receptor for the novel SARS-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) which raising the important issue of possible detrimental effects that RAS blockers could exert on the natural history and pathogenesis of the COronaVIrus Disease 19 (COVID-19) and associated excessive inflammation, myocarditis, and cardiac arrhythmias.
32459372,We review the current knowledge on the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 infection and RAS blockers and suggest a scientific rationale for continuing RAS blockers therapy in patients with COVID-19 infection.
32459529,Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have antiviral effects in vitro against severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32459529,To summarize evidence about the benefits and harms of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine for the treatment or prophylaxis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32459529,PubMed (via MEDLINE), EMBASE (via Ovid), Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, bioRxiv, Preprints, ClinicalTrials.gov, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and the Chinese Clinical Trials Registry from 1 December 2019 until 8 May 2020.
32459529,Studies in any language reporting efficacy or safety outcomes from hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine use in any setting in adults or children with suspected COVID-19 or at risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32459529,Independent, dually performed data extraction and quality assessments.
32459529,Four randomized controlled trials, 10 cohort studies, and 9 case series assessed treatment effects of the medications, but no studies evaluated prophylaxis.
32459529,Evidence was conflicting and insufficient regarding the effect of hydroxychloroquine on such outcomes as all-cause mortality, progression to severe disease, clinical symptoms, and upper respiratory virologic clearance with antigen testing.
32459529,Several studies found that patients receiving hydroxychloroquine developed a QTc interval of 500 ms or greater, but the proportion of patients with this finding varied among the studies.
32459529,Two studies assessed the efficacy of chloroquine; 1 trial, which compared higher-dose (600 mg twice daily for 10 days) with lower-dose (450 mg twice daily on day 1 and once daily for 4 days) therapy, was stopped owing to concern that the higher dose therapy increased lethality and QTc interval prolongation.
32459529,An observational study that compared adults with COVID-19 receiving chloroquine phosphate 500 mg once or twice daily with patients not receiving chloroquine found minor fever resolution and virologic clearance benefits with chloroquine.
32459529,There were few controlled studies, and control for confounding was inadequate in observational studies.
32459529,Evidence on the benefits and harms of using hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine to treat COVID-19 is very weak and conflicting.
32459529,Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.
32459567,In late 2019 a viral pneumonia began to spread across the world.
32459567,The viral disease, COVID-19, is now officially a pandemic, causing concern for the potential risk of systemic therapies for patients with psoriasis.
32459567,The purpose of this review is to analyze what is currently known about COVID-19 in regard to the safety of systemic treatment, and to provide guidelines for use in psoriasis during this pandemic.
32459567,Review of guidelines from various dermatologic regulatory bodies regarding the use of systemic medications during the COVID-19 pandemic was performed and summarized.
32459567,The AAD,NPF and IPC are in agreement regarding their recommendation that patients with active COVID-19 infection should discontinue any biologic therapy.
32459567,Patients with active COVID-19 infections should discontinue systemic treatment for psoriasis.
32459567,Patients with risk factors should discuss continuing treatment on a case by case basis.
32459571,While access to healthcare for permanent residents in Canada is well known, this is not the case for migrants without healthcare coverage.
32459571,This is the first large-scale study that examines the unmet healthcare needs of migrants without healthcare coverage in Montreal. 806 participants were recruited: 436 in the community and 370 at the NGO clinic.
32459571,Proportions of individuals reporting unmet healthcare needs were similar (68.4% vs.
32459571,69.8%)<i>.</i> The main reason invoked for these unmet needs was lacking money (80.6%).
32459571,Situations of not working or studying, not having had enough food in the past 12 months, not having a medical prescription to get medication and having had a workplace injury were all significantly associated with higher odds of having unmet healthcare needs.
32459571,Unmet healthcare needs were more frequent among migrants without healthcare coverage than among recent immigrants or the citizens with health healthcare coverage (69%, 26%, 16%).
32459571,Canada must take measures to enable these individuals to have access to healthcare according to their needs in order to reduce the risk of worsening their health status, something that may have an impact on the healthcare system and population health.
32459571,The Government of Quebec announced that all individuals without any healthcare coverage will have access to COVID-19 related health care.
32459571,We hope that this right, the application of which is not yet obvious, can continue after the pandemic for all health care.
32459574,In spite of the relatively high morbidity and mortality, there is no approved medication yet for COVID-19.
32459574,There are more than 200 ongoing trials on different drugs or vaccines, but new medications may take until 2021 to develop.
32459574,Defining the optimal number of patients to be included in a study is a considerable challenge in these interventional researches.
32459574,Ethical considerations prompt researchers to minimize the number of patients included in a trial.
32459574,This gains particular importance when the disease is rare or lethal which is particularly so in the case of COVID-19.
32459574,It is of paramount importance to explore some of the available tools that could help accelerate the adoption of any or some of the many proposed modalities for the treatment of diseases.
32459574,These tools should be effective, yet efficient, for rapid testing of such treatments.
32459574,Sequential analysis has not been frequently used in many clinical trials where it should have been used.
32459574,None of the authors in published literature, as far as we know, used sequential analysis techniques to test potential drugs for COVID-19.
32459574,In addition to its usefulness when the results of new forms of treatment are quickly needed, other important benefit of sequential analysis includes the ability to reach a similar conclusion about the utility of a new drug without unduly exposing more patients to the side effect of the old drug, in particularly, for the treatment of a rare disease.
32459621,As a result of the coronavirus disease pandemic, commercial hand hygiene products have become scarce and World Health Organization (WHO) alcohol-based hand rub formulations containing ethanol or isopropanol are being produced for hospitals worldwide.
32459621,Neither WHO formulation meets European Norm 12791, the basis for approval as a surgical hand preparation, nor satisfies European Norm 1500, the basis for approval as a hygienic hand rub.
32459621,We evaluated the efficacy of modified formulations with alcohol concentrations in mass instead of volume percentage and glycerol concentrations of 0.5% instead of 1.45%.
32459621,Both modified formulations met standard requirements for a 3-minute surgical hand preparation, the usual duration of surgical hand treatment in most hospitals in Europe.
32459621,Contrary to the originally proposed WHO hand rub formulations, both modified formulations are appropriate for surgical hand preparation after 3 minutes when alcohol concentrations of 80% wt/wt ethanol or 75% wt/wt isopropanol along with reduced glycerol concentration (0.5%) are used.
32459655,Due to demographic change and, more recently, the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), the importance of modern intensive care units (ICU) is becoming apparent.
32459655,One of the key components of an ICU is the continuous monitoring of patients' vital parameters.
32459655,However, existing advances in informatics, signal processing, or engineering that could alleviate the burden on ICUs have not yet been applied.
32459655,This could be related to the lack of user involvement in research and development.
32459655,This study focused on satisfaction of ICU staff with the current patient monitoring and their suggestions for future improvements.
32459655,We aimed to identify aspects disturbing patient care, display devices for remote monitoring, use cases for artificial intelligence (AI), and whether ICU staff is willing to improve their digital literacy or contribute to the improvement of patient monitoring.
32459655,We further desired to uncover differences in the responses of the professional groups.
32459655,This survey study was realized with ICU staff from four ICUs of a German university hospital between November 2019 and January 2020.
32459655,We developed a web-based 36-item survey questionnaire by analyzing a preceding qualitative interview study with ICU staff about clinical requirements of future patient monitoring.
32459655,Statistical analyses of questionnaire results included median values with their bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals, and Chi-square tests to compare the distributions of item responses of the professional groups.
32459655,Eighty-six of the 270 ICU physicians and nurses completed the survey questionnaire.
32459655,The majority stated to feel confident using the patient monitoring, but high rates of false positive alarms and the many sensor cables were considered to disturb patient care.
32459655,Wireless sensors, reduction of false positive alarms and hospital standard operating procedures (SOP) for alarm management were demanded.
32459655,Responses to the display devices proposed for remote patient monitoring were split.
32459655,Regarding its use, most respondents indicated responsibility for multiple wards or earlier alerting.
32459655,AI for ICUs would be useful for early detection of complications and increased risk of mortality, as well as to have guidelines for therapy and diagnostics proposed.
32459655,Transparency, interoperability, usability, and staff training were essential to promote usage of an AI.
32459655,The majority wanted to learn more about new technologies for ICU and desired more time for it.
32459655,Physicians had fewer reservations than nurses about using mobile phones for remote monitoring, and AI-based intelligent alarm management.
32459655,This survey study among ICU staff revealed key improvements for patient monitoring in intensive care medicine.
32459655,Hospital providers and medical device manufacturers should focus on reducing false alarms, implementing hospital alarm SOPs, introducing wireless sensors, preparing for the use of AI, and enhancing digital literacy of ICU staff.
32459655,Our results may contribute to the user-centered transfer of digital technologies into practice to alleviate challenges in intensive care medicine.

32459664,Two population-based surveys on coronavirus disease-2019 (Covid-19)-like symptoms were conducted by BVA-Doxa on representative samples of the general population from Italy and its largest region, Lombardy, with over 10 million inhabitants and heavily struck by Covid-19, on 27-30 March and 3-7 April, on a total of 2000 individuals - 353 from Lombardy.
32459664,Overall, 14.2% of Italians - and 19.6% in Lombardy - reported Covid-19-like symptoms.
32459664,The estimated prevalence was higher in the young, in smokers, and in Lombardy over the period 20 March to 7 April.
32459664,Although the influenza season was ended by mid-March, at least part of the symptoms may be not Covid-19 related.
32459664,Even assuming that only half are, at least 7% of Italians and 10% in Lombardy had been affected by Covid-19.
32459664,To these, asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic cases have to be added.
32459664,These estimates are at least one or two orders of magnitude larger than official registered cases.
32459664,This has major implications for cancer prevention, management and treatment.
32459790,Spain has been one of the countries most severely affected by the coronavirus disease 2019.
32459790,This study aims to describe a series of children admitted to a PICU due to coronavirus disease 2019 infection.
32459790,Prospective observational study.
32459790,Tertiary hospital in Madrid, Spain.
32459790,Children admitted to the PICU with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) infection, from March 1, 2020, to April 15, 2020.
32459790,Observational study.
32459790,Epidemiologic data, previous clinical characteristics, support therapy needed, imaging tests, laboratory observations on admission, and pharmacologic therapy.
32459790,Eleven children were admitted to the PICU, with suspected coronavirus disease 2019; the polymerase chain reaction test was positive in seven.
32459790,The median age was 100.7 months (range, 0.5-162).
32459790,Five were admitted from the emergency department and two from the ward.
32459790,The Pediatric Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score was 3 (range, 0-9), and Pediatric Risk of Mortality II score was 4 (range, 0-16).
32459790,All children were previously healthy except one (allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation).
32459790,Respiratory symptoms and fever were prevalent.
32459790,A chest radiograph led to a pneumonia diagnosis.
32459790,Not all patients presented with lymphopenia on admission.
32459790,D-Dimer and ferritin were elevated.
32459790,All patients needed oxygen therapy through a nasal cannula; five patients received high-flow nasal cannula therapy, which was later substituted with noninvasive ventilation in four.
32459790,Mechanical ventilation was necessary in two patients on the first day of PICU admission.
32459790,Two children required mechanical ventilation and inotropic support.
32459790,Tocilizumab was applied in two intubated children.
32459790,Also, four children received heparin.
32459790,No patients died.
32459790,On the whole, the children were previously healthy and are more than 1 year old.
32459790,Respiratory symptoms were the leading cause of PICU admission, making respiratory support the principal therapy.
32459790,Patients requiring mechanical ventilation showed deterioration on the first day of admission.
32459790,These children seemed to require close monitoring, and multicenter studies are necessary.
32459919,Remdesivir is an RNA polymerase inhibitor with potent antiviral activity in vitro and efficacy in animal models of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19).
32459919,We conducted a randomized, open-label, phase 3 trial involving hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, oxygen saturation of 94% or less while they were breathing ambient air, and radiologic evidence of pneumonia.
32459919,Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive intravenous remdesivir for either 5 days or 10 days.
32459919,All patients received 200 mg of remdesivir on day 1 and 100 mg once daily on subsequent days.
32459919,The primary end point was clinical status on day 14, assessed on a 7-point ordinal scale.
32459919,In total, 397 patients underwent randomization and began treatment (200 patients for 5 days and 197 for 10 days).
32459919,The median duration of treatment was 5 days (interquartile range, 5 to 5) in the 5-day group and 9 days (interquartile range, 5 to 10) in the 10-day group.
32459919,At baseline, patients randomly assigned to the 10-day group had significantly worse clinical status than those assigned to the 5-day group (P = 0.02).
32459919,By day 14, a clinical improvement of 2 points or more on the ordinal scale occurred in 64% of patients in the 5-day group and in 54% in the 10-day group.
32459919,After adjustment for baseline clinical status, patients in the 10-day group had a distribution in clinical status at day 14 that was similar to that among patients in the 5-day group (P = 0.14).
32459919,The most common adverse events were nausea (9% of patients), worsening respiratory failure (8%), elevated alanine aminotransferase level (7%), and constipation (7%).
32459919,In patients with severe Covid-19 not requiring mechanical ventilation, our trial did not show a significant difference between a 5-day course and a 10-day course of remdesivir.
32459919,With no placebo control, however, the magnitude of benefit cannot be determined.
32459919,(Funded by Gilead Sciences; GS-US-540-5773 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04292899.).
32460086,To determine whether the course of COVID-19 is more severe in patients with MS and if MS disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) affect the risk of contracting the disease.
32460086,In a cross-sectional survey, data were collected by sending a questionnaire to 2000 patients with a demyelinating disease through an online portal system.
32460086,Collected data included the current MS DMT and patient-reported disability level, history of recent sick contact, recent fever, respiratory symptoms, diagnosis with COVID-19, and the disposition after the diagnosis.
32460086,We defined a COVID-19-suspect group as patients having fever and cough or fever and shortness of breath, or a presumptive diagnosis based on suggestive chest computed tomography.
32460086,We calculated the proportion of COVID-19-suspect patients and compared their demographics, clinical characteristics, and DMT categories with the rest of survey-responders, using univariable and multivariable models.
32460086,Out of 712 patients, 34 (4.8%) fulfilled our criteria for being in the COVID-19-suspect group.
32460086,Only two patients required hospitalization.
32460086,No patient required intensive care.
32460086,In a multivariable model, disease duration (p-value=0.017), DMT category (p-value=0.030), and history of sick contact (p-values&lt;0.001) were associated with the risk of being in the COVID-19-suspect group.
32460086,Being on B-cell depleting antibodies (as compared to non-cell depleting, non-cell trafficking inhibitor DMTs) was associated with a 2.6-fold increase in the risk of being in the COVID-19-suspect group.
32460086,(RR: 3.55, 95%CI: 1.45, 8.68, p-value=0.005).
32460086,The course of infection in patients with MS suspected of having COVID-19 was mild to moderate, and all patients had a full recovery.
32460086,B-cell depleting antibodies may increase the susceptibility to contracting COVID-19.
32460133,SARS-CoV2 infection is an emerging issue worldwide.
32460133,Cancer patient are at increased risk of infection compared to general population.
32460133,On the other hand, these patients are at major risk of drug interactions caused by renal and hepatic impairment background.
32460133,Because of the long-term use of chemotherapy drugs, drug interactions are important in these patients especially with SARS-CoV2 treatments now.
32460133,This paper is review of reported drug interactions of current treatments for COVID-19 and anticancer agents.
32460184,Macroeconomic indicators, notably unemployment, are significant moderators of suicide.
32460184,We projected the number of excess suicides in Canada as a consequence of the impact of COVID-19 on unemployment.
32460184,Annual suicide mortality (2000-2018) and unemployment (2000-2019) data were derived from Statistics Canada.
32460184,Time-trend regression models were used to evaluate and predict the number of excess suicides in 2020 and 2021 for two possible projection scenarios following the COVID-19 pandemic: 1) an increase in unemployment of 1.6% in 2020, 1.2% in 2021, or 2) an increase in unemployment of 10.7% in 2020, 8.9% in 2021.
32460184,A percentage point increase in unemployment was associated with a 1.0% increase in suicide between 2000 and 2018.
32460184,In the first scenario, the rise in unemployment rates resulted in a projected total of 418 excess suicides in 2020-2021 (suicide rate per 100,000: 11.6 in 2020).
32460184,In the second scenario, the projected suicide rates per 100,000 increased to 14.0 in 2020 and 13.6 in 2021, resulting in 2114 excess suicides in 2020-2021.
32460184,These results indicate that suicide prevention in the context of COVID-19-related unemployment is a critical priority.
32460184,Furthermore, timely access to mental healthcare, financial provisions and social/labour support programs, as well as optimal treatment for mental disorders is urgently needed.
32460208,A novel human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (also referred to as CoV-19) that emerged in late 2019 causes Covid-19 disease a respiratory tract infection which provokes about 4 million deaths per year.
32460208,Unfortunately, to date, there is no specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
32460208,Mast cells (MCs) are immune cells implicated in the pathogenesis of viral infections, where they mediate inflammation.
32460208,Microbes, including virus, activate MCs through TLR releasing chemical pro-inflammatory compounds and cytokines.
32460208,Although, in biomedical literature there are only few reports on MCs activation by SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32460208,The production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by MC viral activation leads to increase pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis.
32460208,Sodium Chromo-Glycate (SCG) described as a MC stabilizer, prevents the release of inflammatory chemical compounds, improve mouse survival and respiratory pathological changes in lung viral infection and suppresses inflammation.
32460208,Furthermore, palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) a nuclear factor agonist, an endogenous fatty acid amide, which exerts a variety of biological effects, related to chronic inflammation and pain, is involved also in MCs homeostasis with an inhibitory and protective effect on the respiratory tract during viral infections.
32460208,Here, we hypothesize for the first time, that SCG and/or PEA suppress MC activation and pro-inflammatory mediators release, playing an anti-inflammatory therapeutic role in the inflamed lung of patients with COVID-19.
32460364,To present seven pediatric patients with appendicitis, all with late diagnosis resulting from different aspects of the fear from the current global COVID-19 pandemic.
32460364,Cases were collected from three pediatric surgical wards.
32460364,Comparison between complicated appendicitis rates in the COVID-19 era and similar period in previous year was performed.
32460364,All seven children presented with complicated appendicitis.
32460364,Main reasons for the delayed diagnosis during the COVID-19 era were parental concern, telemedicine use and insufficient evaluation.
32460364,Higher complication rates were found during the COVID-19 era compared to similar period in previous year (22% vs. 11%, p-value 0.06).
32460364,The fear from COVID-19 pandemic may result in delayed diagnosis and higher complication rates in common pediatric medical conditions.
32460364,We believe care givers as well as healthcare providers should not withhold necessary medical care since delay in diagnosis and treatment in these routinely seen medical emergencies may become as big of a threat as COVID-19 itself.
32460369,Since there is still no definitive conclusion regarding which non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are most effective and safe in viral respiratory infections, we decided to evaluate the efficacy and safety of various NSAIDs in viral respiratory infections so that we can reach a conclusion on which NSAID is best choice for COVID-19.
32460369,A search was performed in Medline (via PubMed), Embase, and CENTRAL databases until 23 March 2020.
32460369,Clinical trials on application of NSAIDs in viral respiratory infections were included.
32460369,Six clinical trials were included.
32460369,No clinical trial has been performed on COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome infections.
32460369,Studies show that ibuprofen and naproxen not only have positive effects in controlling cold symptoms but also do not cause serious side effects in rhinovirus infections.
32460369,In addition, it was found that clarithromycin, naproxen and oseltamivir combination leads to decrease in mortality rate and duration of hospitalization in patients with pneumonia due to influenza.
32460369,Although based on existing evidence, NSAIDs have been effective in treating respiratory infections caused by influenza and rhinovirus, since there is no clinical trial on COVID-19 and case-reports and clinical experiences are indicative of elongation of treatment duration and exacerbation of the clinical course of patients with COVID-19, it is recommended to use substitutes such as acetaminophen for controlling fever and inflammation and be cautious about using NSAIDs in management of COVID-19 patients until there are enough evidence.
32460369,Naproxen may be a good choice for future clinical trials.
32460390,Solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients may be at risk for severe COVID-19.
32460390,Data on the clinical course of COVID-19 in immunosuppressed patients are limited and the effective treatment strategy for these patients is unknown.
32460390,We describe our institutional experience with COVID-19 in SOT.
32460390,Demographic, clinical and treatment data were extracted from the electronic patient files.
32460390,A total of 23 SOT transplant recipients suffering from COVID-19 were identified (n = 3 heart; n =15 kidney; n = 1 kidney-after-heart; n = 3 lung and n = 1 liver transplant recipient).
32460390,The presenting symptoms were similar to non-immunocompromised patients Eighty-three percent (19/23) of the patients required hospitalization but only two of these were transferred to the intensive care unit.
32460390,Five patients died from COVID-19; all had high Clinical Frailty scores.
32460390,In four of these patients, mechanical ventilation was deemed futile.
32460390,In 57% of patients, the immunosuppressive therapy was not changed and only 3 patients were treated with chloroquine.
32460390,Most patients recovered without experimental anti-viral therapy.
32460390,Modification of the immunosuppressive regimen alone could be a therapeutic option for SOT recipients suffering from moderate to severe COVID-19.
32460390,Pre-existent frailty is associated with death from COVID-19.
32460417,In December 2019 an epidemic outbreak of a new virus disease in the Chinese area of Wuhan was reported.
32460417,The new disease caused primarily symptoms of a respiratory tract infection with cough, shortness of breath, and viral pneumonia.
32460417,The clinical spectrum showed mostly mild symptoms with some patients developing bilateral pneumonia needing partly intensive care treatment and causing death(1).
32460417,It became apparent, that this new disease was highly contagious, and - intensive care - patients numbers were rapidly rocketing, overwhelming the capacity of local health care facilities.
32460421,The most frequent cancer worldwide is skin cancer, occurring at epidemic rates in countries exposed to high levels of chronic ultraviolet radiation such as Australia and New Zealand (ANZ).
32460421,Australia has the highest incidence of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) in the world.
32460421,NMSC is predominantly a cancer of the middle aged or elderly and accounts for considerable consulting and treatment time in most radiation oncology departments.
32460421,Many patients also suffer from medical co-morbidity, an important factor in any treatment decision.
32460457,As the novel coronavirus (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]) outbreak progresses rapidly, staying home is recommended for suspected patients; however, the safety of this recommendation is uncertain.
32460457,In Korea, non-hospital facilities called &quot;living and treatment centers (LTCs)&quot; have been established since 5 March 2020.
32460457,The LTCs provided a unique opportunity to evaluate the safety of selection criteria for low-risk groups.
32460457,Between 5 March and 9 April 2020, patients with COVID-19 who met the following criteria were admitted to the LTC; alert, age below 65 years old, no underlying disease or well-controlled underlying disease, body temperature below 38.0°C, whether taking antipyretics or not, and no dyspnea.
32460457,Patients were closely observed by doctors or nurses' interviews twice a day and transferred to hospitals when symptoms worsened.
32460457,A total of 113 patients were admitted to the LTC; 52.2% were female, with a median age of 25 years (interquartile range, 21.5 to 39.5).
32460457,Of 113 patients, 54 (47.8%) were asymptomatic at diagnosis, and 15 (13.3%) had no symptoms until they were released from isolation.
32460457,During the follow-up period, two (1.8%) patients were transferred to a hospital but did not progress to severe status during hospitalization.
32460457,The risk of progression was negligible in COVID-19 patients who met the admission criteria for LTC at the time of diagnosis.
32460457,LTCs could be a safe alternative considering shortage of hospital beds.
32460458,As the coronavirus disease-2019 global pandemic progresses, screening of antiviral agents effective against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is urgently needed.
32460458,In addition, considering the viral load kinetics of SARS-CoV-2, which peaks early in the illness, and the massive burden of the disease, which may increase in the near future, identifying well-tolerated oral antivirals becomes increasingly important.
32460458,We examined the in vitro activity of lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine on SARS-CoV-2, at concentrations which can be used to treat coronavirus-19 patients with little concern of toxicity.
32460458,Lopinavir/ritonavir (7/1.75 μg/mL), hydroxychloroquine base (1 or 2 μg/mL), or a combination thereof were administered 1 hour after the inoculation of SARS-CoV-2 to Vero cells at a multiplicity of infection of 0.05.
32460458,We examined cytopathic effects of virus 48 hours after administration of the respective treatments and measured viral loads at three time points (0, 24, and 48 hours post-treatment) by quantitative real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, and compared the results obtained from the different antiviral regimens tested.
32460458,The severity of cytopathic effects was lower in lopinavir/ritonavir-treated cells, and viral load was significantly reduced in this group compared with the control group (p &lt; 0.001).
32460458,However, hydroxychloroquine did not show significant inhibitory effects on anti-SARS-CoV-2-mediated cytotoxicity or on viral load at either concentration.
32460458,Lopinavir/ritonavir showed significant inhibitory effects on SARS-CoV-2 in vitro at its usual plasma concentration.
32460458,However, the in vitro antiviral activity of hydroxychloroquine at concentrations commonly used in humans was minimal, whether used alone or in combination with lopinavir/ritonavir.
32460624,The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID 19), spreading from China all around the world in early 2020, has led scientists to investigate the immuno-mediated mechanisms underlying the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) infection.
32460624,Depending on the amount of cytokines released as the result of the immunological activation induced by SARS-CoV2, three major clinical phenotypes can be identified: &quot;mild&quot;,symbolized as a &quot;drizzle&quot; of cytokines, severe as a &quot;storm&quot;, and critical as a &quot;hurricane&quot;.
32460624,In patients with mild symptoms, the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines is balanced to obtain a defense response against the virus which is often self-limiting and overcomes without tissue damage.
32460624,In severe phenotype, resembling a &quot;cytokine-release syndrome&quot;, SARS-CoV2 causes the lysis of the immune-mediators leading to a cytokine storm able to induce lung epithelium damage and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
32460624,In critical patients, the immune response may become uncontrolled, thus the cytokine burst resembles a form of secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis which may result in a multi organ failure.
32460624,In addition to the standard of care, an immune-modulatory therapy tailored to each one of the different phenotypes should be used in order to prevent or reduce the release of cytokines responsible for organ damage and disease progression.
32460632,<b> <i>Background:</i> </b> Viral infections after burns are less common than bacterial infections but usually occur in the more severely burned patients and have been associated with poor outcomes. <b> <i>Methods:</i> </b> Retrospective reviews and case series were examined to provide an overview of the management of viral infections in the burn patient. <b> <i>Results:</i> </b> The most common viral pathogens in these patients are the herpesviruses, which include herpes simplex, varicella zoster, cytomegalovirus, and human herpesvirus 6.
32460632,Established viral infections that may complicate patient management include human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B and C, and, more recently, the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
32460632,Herpesvirus infections can occur as primary or nosocomial pathogens but clinical manifestations most commonly are re-activation of latent viral infection.
32460632,Because of the paucity of data in the burn population, much of the evidence for specific treatments is extrapolated from patients with severe immunosuppression or critical illness.
32460632,Antiviral therapy is employed for the burn patient with herpesvirus infections.
32460632,This is an area of active study, and further research is needed to better understand the risks, clinical manifestations, and attributable morbidity and mortality of viral infections. <b> <i>Conclusions:</i> </b> Major burn injury results in immunosuppression and viral infection in a small number of patients.
32460632,Recognition and antiviral therapy are employed, but additional studies are necessary to improve outcomes in these patients.
32460829,Cancer patients have been reported to be at higher risk of COVID-19 complications and deaths.
32460829,We report the characteristics and outcome of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 during breast cancer treatment at Institut Curie hospitals (ICH, Paris area, France).
32460829,An IRB-approved prospective registry was set up at ICH on March 13, 2020, for all breast cancer patients with COVID-19 symptoms or radiologic signs.
32460829,Registered data included patient history, tumor characteristics and treatments, COVID-19 symptoms, radiological features, and outcome.
32460829,Data extraction was done on April 25, 2020.
32460829,COVID-19 patients were defined as those with either a positive RNA test or typical, newly appeared lung CT scan abnormalities.
32460829,Among 15,600 patients actively treated for early or metastatic breast cancer during the last 4 months at ICH, 76 patients with suspected COVID-19 infection were included in the registry and followed.
32460829,Fifty-nine of these patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 based on viral RNA testing (N = 41) or typical radiologic signs: 37/59 (63%) COVID-19 patients were treated for metastatic breast cancer, and 13/59 (22%) of them were taking corticosteroids daily.
32460829,Common clinical features mostly consisted of fever and/or cough, while ground-glass opacities were the most common radiologic sign at diagnosis.
32460829,We found no association between prior radiation therapy fields or extent of radiation therapy sequelae and extent of COVID-19 lung lesions.
32460829,Twenty-eight of these 59 patients (47%) were hospitalized, and 6 (10%) were transferred to an intensive care unit.
32460829,At the time of analysis, 45/59 (76%) patients were recovering or had been cured, 10/59 (17%) were still followed, and 4/59 (7%) had died from COVID-19.
32460829,All 4 patients who died had significant non-cancer comorbidities.
32460829,In univariate analysis, hypertension and age (&gt; 70) were the two factors associated with a higher risk of intensive care unit admission and/or death.
32460829,This prospective registry analysis suggests that the COVID-19 mortality rate in breast cancer patients depends more on comorbidities than prior radiation therapy or current anti-cancer treatment.
32460829,Special attention must be paid to comorbidities when estimating the risk of severe COVID-19 in breast cancer patients.
32460839,The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has grown to be a global public health emergency since patients were first detected in Wuhan, China.
32460839,Thus far, no specific drugs or vaccines are available to cure the patients with COVID-19 infection.
32460839,The immune system and inflammation are proposed to play a central role in COVID-19 pathogenesis.
32460839,Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been shown to possess a comprehensive powerful immunomodulatory function.
32460839,Intravenous infusion of MSCs has shown promising results in COVID-19 treatment.
32460839,Here, we report a case of a severe COVID-19 patient treated with human umbilical cord Wharton's jelly-derived MSCs (hWJCs) from a healthy donor in Liaocheng People's Hospital, China, from February 24, 2020.
32460839,The pulmonary function and symptoms of the patient with COVID-19 pneumonia was significantly improved in 2 days after hWJC transplantation, and recovered and discharged in 7 days after treatment.
32460839,After treatment, the percentage and counts of lymphocyte subsets (CD3<sup>+</sup>, CD4<sup>+</sup>, and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell) were increased, and the level of IL-6, TNF-α, and C-reactive protein is significantly decreased after hWJC treatment.
32460839,Thus, the intravenous transplantation of hWJCs was safe and effective for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, especially for the patients in a critically severe condition.
32460839,This report highlights the potential of hWJC infusions as an effective treatment for COVID-19 pneumonia.
32460926,As the Covid-19 pandemic escalates worldwide it is apparent that many patients with more severe illness will also experience delirium.
32460926,These patients pose a particular challenge in the application of optimal care due to issues with infectious risk, respiratory compromise and potential interactions between medications that can be used to manage delirium with antiviral and other treatments used for Covid-19.
32460926,We describe a guidance resource adapted from existing guidelines for delirium management that has been tailored to the specific challenge of managing delirium in patients with Covid-19 infection.
32460926,Issues around the assessment and treatment of these patients are examined and distilled into a simple (one-paged guidance resource that can assist clinicians in managing suspected delirium.
32461141,The novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 originates in the lungs, but may extend to other organs, causing, in severe cases, multiorgan damage, including cardiac injury and acute kidney injury.
32461141,In severe cases, the presence of kidney injury is associated with increased risk of death, highlighting the relevance of this organ as a target of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32461141,COVID-19-associated tissue injury is not primarily mediated by viral infection, but rather is a result of the inflammatory host immune response, which drives hypercytokinemia and aggressive inflammation that affect lung parenchymal cells, diminishing oxygen uptake but also endothelial cells, resulting in endotheliitis and thrombotic events and intravascular coagulation.
32461141,The complement system represents the first response of the host immune system to SARS-CoV-2 infection, but there is growing evidence that unrestrained activation of complement induced by the virus in the lungs and other organs plays a major role in acute and chronic inflammation, endothelial cell dysfunction, thrombus formation and intravascular coagulation, and ultimately contributes to multiple organ failure and death.
32461141,In this review we will discuss the relative role of the different complement activation products in the pathogenesis of COVID-19-associated tissue inflammation and thrombosis and propose the hypothesis that blockade of the terminal complement pathway may represent a potential therapeutic option for the prevention and treatment of lung and multi-organ damage.
32461198,The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread all around the world in a very short period of time.
32461198,Recent data are showing significant prevalence of arterial hypertension and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) among patients with COVID-19, which raised many questions about higher susceptibility of patients with these comorbidities to the novel coronavirus, as well as the role of hypertension and CVD in progression and the prognosis of COVID-19 patients.
32461198,There is a very limited amount of data, usually obtained from a small population, regarding the effect of the underlying disease on the outcome in patients with COVID-19.
32461198,The evaluation of the treatment of these comorbidities at baseline and during COVID-19 is scarce and the results are conflicting.
32461198,Hypertension and CVD, after the adjustment for other clinical and demographic parameters, primarily age, did not remain independent predictors of the lethal outcome in COVID-19 patients.
32461198,Some investigations speculated about the association between the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and susceptibility to COVID-19, as well as the relationship between RAAS inhibitors and the adverse outcome in these patients.
32461198,Withdrawing or switching RAAS inhibitors would have uncertain benefits, but it would definitely have many disadvantages such as uncontrolled hypertension, cardiac function deterioration and renal function impairment, which could potentially induce more complications in patients with COVID-19 than the infection of coronavirus itself.
32461198,The aim of this review article was to summarize the prevalence of hypertension and CVD in patients with COVID-19, their influence on the outcome and the effect of treatment of hypertension and CVD in COVID-19 patients.
32461261,Many ethical issues arise concerning the care of critically ill and dying patients during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
32461261,In this issue's Ethics Rounds, we present 2 cases that highlight 2 different sorts of ethical issues.
32461261,One is focused on the decisions that have to be made when the surge of patients with respiratory failure overwhelm ICUs.
32461261,The other is focused on the psychological issues that arise for parents who are caring for a dying child when infection-control policies limit the number of visitors.
32461261,Both of these situations raise challenges for caregivers who are trying to be honest, to deal with their own moral distress, and to provide compassionate palliative care.
32461415,To describe the experience of tele-consultations addressed at the centre of excellence of a multi-tier ophthalmology hospital network in India during the ongoing novel coronavirus (COVID-19) lockdown.
32461415,This cross-sectional hospital-based study included 7,008 tele-consultations presenting between March 23<sup>rd</sup> and April 19<sup>th</sup> 2020.
32461415,A three-level protocol was implemented to triage the calls.
32461415,The data of patient queries were collected using a Google Form/Sheets and the tele-calls were returned using the patient information retrieved from the electronic medical record system.
32461415,Overall, 7,008 tele-calls were addressed, of which 2,805 (40.02%) patients where a clinical-related query was answered were included for analysis.
32461415,The most common queries were related to redness/pain/watering/blurring of vision (31.52%), closely followed by usage of medications (31.05%).
32461415,The majority of the queries were directed to the department of cornea (34.15%), followed by retina (24.74%).
32461415,Less than one-fifth of the patients were from the lower socio-economic class (16.08%) and one-fourth were new patients (23.96%).
32461415,The most common advice given to the patient was related to management of medications (54.15%) followed by appointment related (17.79%).
32461415,Emergency requests requiring further evaluation by an ophthalmologist accounted for a small percentage (16.36%) of patients.
32461415,Tracking of tele-consultations and access to patient information from the electronic medical records enabled a timely response in an ongoing lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
32461415,The current experience provided valuable insights to the possibility of managing patient follow-up visits remotely in the future.
32461502,The reported number of new cases underestimates the real spread of COVID-19 pandemic because of non-tested asymptomatic people and limited global access to reliable diagnostic tests.
32461502,In this context, COVID-19 mortality with confirmed diagnosis becomes an attractive source of information to be included in the analysis of perspectives and proposals.
32461502,Objective data are required to calculate the capacity of resources provided by health systems.
32461502,New strategies are needed to stabilize or minimize the mortality surge.
32461502,However, we will not afford this goal until more alternatives were available.
32461502,We still need an effective treatment, an affordable vaccine, or a collective achievement of sufficient immunity (reaching up to 70% of the whole population).
32461502,At any time, the arriving waves of the pandemic are testing the capacity of governments.
32461502,The health services struggle to keep the plateau in a steady-state below 100 deaths per million inhabitants.
32461502,Therefore, it is necessary to increase the alternatives and supplies based on the current and near-future expected demands imposed by the number of deaths by COVID-19.
32461502,Estimating COVID-19 mortality in various scenarios with the gradual release of social constraints will help predict the magnitude of those arriving waves.
32461973,A new endemic disease has spread across Wuhan City, China, in December 2019.
32461973,Within few weeks, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a novel coronavirus designated as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32461973,In late January 2020, WHO declared the outbreak of a &quot;public-health emergency of international concern&quot; due to the rapid and increasing spread of the disease worldwide.
32461973,Currently, there is no vaccine or approved treatment for this emerging infection; thus, the objective of this study is to design a multiepitope peptide vaccine against COVID-19 using an immunoinformatics approach.
32461973,Several techniques facilitating the combination of the immunoinformatics approach and comparative genomic approach were used in order to determine the potential peptides for designing the T-cell epitope-based peptide vaccine using the envelope protein of 2019-nCoV as a target.
32461973,Extensive mutations, insertion, and deletion were discovered with comparative sequencing in the COVID-19 strain.
32461973,Additionally, ten peptides binding to MHC class I and MHC class II were found to be promising candidates for vaccine design with adequate world population coverage of 88.5% and 99.99%, respectively.
32461973,The T-cell epitope-based peptide vaccine was designed for COVID-19 using the envelope protein as an immunogenic target.
32461973,Nevertheless, the proposed vaccine rapidly needs to be validated clinically in order to ensure its safety and immunogenic profile to help stop this epidemic before it leads to devastating global outbreaks.
32461981,Recently, a large-scale novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) outbreak swept China.
32461981,As of Feb. 9, 2020, a total of 40,260 patients have been diagnosed with NCP, and 23,589 patients were suspected to have infected by the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19), which puts forward a great challenge for public health and clinical treatment in China.
32461981,Until now, we are in the high-incidence season of NCP.
32461981,Thus, the analysis of the transmissibility change of NCP and its potential factors may provide a reliable reference for establishing effective prevention and control strategies.
32461981,By means of the method of calculating the instantaneous basic reproduction number <i>R</i><sub>0<i>t</i></sub> proposed by Cori et al. (2013), we use <i>R</i><sub>0<i>t</i></sub> to describe the transmissibility change of COVID-19 in China, 2019-2020.
32461981,In addition, the Baidu Index (BDI) and Baidu Migration Scale (BMS) were selected to measure the public awareness and the effect of Wuhan lockdown (restricted persons in Wuhan outflow from the epidemic area) strategy, respectively.
32461981,The Granger causality test (GCT) was carried out to explore the association between public awareness, the effect of the Wuhan lockdown strategy, and the transmissibility of COVID-19.
32461981,The estimated averaged basic reproduction number of NCP in China was 3.44 with 95% CI (2.87, 4.0) during Dec. 8, 2019, to Feb.
32461981,9, 2020.
32461981,The instantaneous basic reproduction numbers (<i>R</i><sub>0<i>t</i></sub> ) have two waves and reaching peaks on Jan. 8 and Jan. 27, respectively.
32461981,After reaching a peak on Jan. 27, <i>R</i><sub>0<i>t</i></sub> showed a continuous decline trend.
32461981,On Feb. 9, <i>R</i><sub>0<i>t</i></sub> has fallen to 1.68 (95% CI: 1.66, 1.7), but it is still larger than 1.
32461981,We find a significantly negative association between public awareness and the transmissibility change of COVID-19, with one unit increase in cumulative BDI leading to a decrease of 0.0295% (95% CI: 0.0077, 0.051) <i>R</i><sub>0<i>t</i></sub> .
32461981,We also find a significantly negative association between the effect of the Wuhan lockdown strategy and the transmissibility change of COVID-19, and a one unit decrease in BMS may lead to a drop of 2.7% (95% CI: 0.382, 4.97) <i>R</i><sub>0<i>t</i></sub> .
32461981,The current prevention and control measures have effectively reduced the transmissibility of COVID-19; however, <i>R</i><sub>0<i>t</i></sub> is still larger than the threshold 1.
32461981,The results show that the government adopting the Wuhan lockdown strategy plays an important role in restricting the potential infected persons in Wuhan outflow from the epidemic area and avoiding a nationwide spread by quickly controlling the potential infection in Wuhan.
32461981,Meanwhile, since Jan. 18, 2020, the people successively accessed COVID-19-related information via the Internet, which may help to effectively implement the government's prevention and control strategy and contribute to reducing the transmissibility of NCP.
32461981,Therefore, ongoing travel restriction and public health awareness remain essential to provide a foundation for controlling the outbreak of COVID-19.
32462098,Considering the population density, healthcare capacity, limited resources and existing poverty, environmental factors, social structure, cultural norms, and already more than 18,863 people infected, the community transmission of COVID-19 is happening fast.
32462098,These exacerbated a complex fear among the public.
32462098,The aim of this article is, therefore, to understand the public perception of socioeconomic crisis and human stress in resource-limited settings of Bangladesh during the COVID-19 outbreak.
32462098,The sample comprised of 1066 Bangladeshi participants.
32462098,Principal component analysis (PCA) was considered to design a standardized scale to measure the mental stress and socioeconomic crisis, one-way ANOVA and t-test were conducted to perceive different demographic risk groups; multiple linear regression was applied to estimate the statistically significant association between each component, and classical test theory (CTT) analysis was applied to examine the reliability of each item according to the components to develop a composite score.
32462098,Without safeguarding the fundamental needs for the vulnerable ultra-poor group can undeniably cause the socioeconomic crisis and mental stress due to the COVID-19 lockdown.
32462098,It has further created unemployment, deprivation, hunger, and social conflicts.
32462098,The weak governance in the fragile healthcare system exacerbates the general public's anxiety as the COVID-19 testing facilities are centered around in the urban areas, a long serial to be tested, minimum or no treatment facilities in the dedicated hospital units for COVID-19 patients are the chief observations hampered along with the disruption of other critical healthcare services.
32462098,One-way ANOVA and t-test confirmed food and nutritional deficiency among the vulnerable poorest section due to loss of livelihood.
32462098,Also, different emergency service provider professions such as doctors, healthcare staff, police forces, volunteer organizations at the frontline, and bankers are at higher risk of infection and subsequently mentally stressed.
32462098,Proper risk assessment of the pandemic and dependable risk communications to risk groups, multi-sectoral management taskforce development, transparency, and good governance with inter-ministerial coordination is required along with strengthening healthcare capacity was suggested to reduce mental and social stress causing a socioeconomic crisis of COVID-19 outbreak.
32462098,Moreover, relief for the low-income population, proper biomedical waste management through incineration, and preparation for the possible natural disasters such as flood, cyclones, and another infectious disease such as dengue was suggested.
32462098,Finally, this assessment process could help the government and policymakers to judge the public perceptions to deal with COVID-19 pandemic in densely populated lower-middle-income and limited-resource countries like Bangladesh.
32462267,Coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19) has become a worldwide pandemic affecting people at high risk and particularly at advanced age, cardiovascular and pulmonary disease.
32462267,As cardiovascular patients are at high risk but also have dyspnea and fatigue as leading symptoms, prevention, diagnostics and treatment in these patients are important to provide adequate care for those with or without COVID-19 but most importantly when comorbid cardiovascular conditions are present.
32462267,Severe COVID-19 with acute respiratory distress (ARDS) is challenging as patients with elevated myocardial markers such as troponin are at enhanced high risk for fatal outcomes.
32462267,As angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is regarded as the viral receptor for cell entry and as the Coronavirus is downregulating this enzyme, which provides cardiovascular and pulmonary protection, there is ongoing discussions on whether treatment with cardiovascular drugs, which upregulate the viral receptor ACE2 should be modified.
32462267,As most of the COVID-19 patients have cardiovascular comorbidities like hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease and heart failure, which imposes a high risk on these patients, cardiovascular therapy should not be modified or even withdrawn.
32462267,As cardiac injury is a common feature of COVID-19 associated ARDS and is linked with poor outcomes, swift diagnostic management and specialist care of cardiovascular patients in the area of COVID-19 is of particular importance and deserves special attention.
32462289,The novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV, COVID-19) is historically one of the most severe acute respiratory syndromes and pandemics to affect the globe in the twenty-first century.
32462289,Originating in Wuhan, the virus rapidly spread and impacted subsets of populations with initial unclear risk factors contributing to worsening morbidity and mortality.
32462289,Patients with diagnosis of cancer and undergoing treatment further represent a population at risk for worsening cardiopulmonary outcomes.
32462289,This review explores specific risk factors, diagnoses, and treatment options that impact cardio-oncologic patients with COVID-19.
32462289,Multiple studies globally, including Italy, China, and the USA, have documented severe outcomes.
32462289,Cancer patients are at increased risk of cardiac injury which itself is a risk factor for mortality.
32462289,Additionally, elderly cancer patients undergoing recent anti-cancer treatment may be at greater risk for sustaining worse outcomes, although data remains suboptimal in this population.
32462289,Major gaps remain regarding risk associated with type of cancer and type of anti-cancer treatment, as well as the layered risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer.
32462289,Immunomodulatory therapies used to treat cytokine release syndrome secondary to anti-cancer therapies, as well as other agents being traditionally used to treat cardiovascular and cancer disease states, are being investigated for treatment of COVID-19.
32462289,Hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer have been associated with more severe COVID-19 infection and worse outcomes.
32462289,Patients undergoing anti-cancer therapy or those who have suffered from coronavirus infection may develop long-standing changes, not limited to pulmonary fibrosis, hyperlipidemia, and worsening atherosclerosis.
32462289,Those undergoing anti-cancer therapy are at theoretically increased susceptibility for infection, with type of cancer not necessarily dictating outcome.
32462289,A review of the literature of patients with cardiovascular and/or cancer disease is presented, as well as proposed strategies to attenuate risk regarding treatment, management, and surveillance in this vulnerable population.
32462412,The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) emerged as a global pandemic.
32462412,Historically, the group of human coronaviruses can also affect the central nervous system leading to neurological symptoms; however, the causative mechanisms of the neurological manifestations of COVID-19 disease are not well known.
32462412,Seizures have not been directly reported as a part of COVID-19 outside of patients with previously known brain injury or epilepsy.
32462412,We report two cases of acute symptomatic seizures, in non-epileptic patients, associated with severe COVID-19 disease.
32462412,Two advanced-age, non-epileptic, male patients presented to our northeast Ohio-based health system with concern for infection in Mid-March 2020.
32462412,Both had a history of lung disease and during their hospitalization tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.
32462412,They developed acute encephalopathy days into their hospitalization with clinical and electrographic seizures.
32462412,Resolution of seizures was achieved with levetiracetam.
32462412,Patients with COVID-19 disease are at an elevated risk for seizures, and the mechanism of these seizures is likely multifactorial.
32462412,Clinical (motor) seizures may not be readily detected in this population due to the expansive utilization of sedatives and paralytics for respiratory optimization strategies.
32462412,Many of these patients are also not electrographically monitored for seizures due to limited resources, multifactorial risk for acute encephalopathy, and the risk of cross-contamination.
32462412,Previously, several neurological symptoms were seen in patients with more advanced COVID-19 disease, and these were thought to be secondary to multi-system organ failure and/or disseminated intravascular coagulopathy-related brain injury.
32462412,However, these patients may also have an advanced breakdown of the blood-brain barrier precipitated by pro-inflammatory cytokine reactions.
32462412,The neurotropic effect and neuroinvasiveness of SARS-Coronavirus-2 have not been directly established.
32462412,Acute symptomatic seizures are possible in patients with COVID-19 disease.
32462412,These seizures are likely multifactorial in origin, including cortical irritation due to blood-brain barrier breakdown, precipitated by the cytokine reaction as a part of the viral infection.
32462412,Patients with clinical signs of seizures or otherwise unexplained encephalopathy may benefit from electroencephalography monitoring and/or empiric anti-epileptic therapy.
32462412,Further studies are needed to elucidate the risk of seizures and benefit of monitoring in this population.
32462423,COVID-19 outbreak has quickly spread worldwide, causing a high pressure on the health-care system.
32462423,In Italy, from March 8, 2020, all the deferrable clinical activities have been suspended to increase the health care offer for COVID-19 patients.
32462423,The hospital organization has been modified also in order to assure non-COVID-19 patients assistance.
32462423,The Scleroderma Unit of ASST Pini-CTO Hospital, in Milan, in the region mostly hit by SARS-CoV-2 in Italy, follows more than 600 patients affected by systemic sclerosis (SSc).
32462423,Patients with SSc need a close follow-up with a regular screening of organ involvement and frequent intravenous treatments.
32462423,All SSc patients have been educated about ministerial directives to limit COVID-19 spread.
32462423,The organization of our Scleroderma Unit has been quickly rethought to assure SSc patients assistance in safety for them and for health-care workers during urgent visits or infusion therapies.
32462423,Using electronic way of communication with frequent virtual contact and guarantying home deliveries of some therapies, we allowed a continuity of care also outside the Hospital.
32462497,COVID-19 pandemic poses an enormous challenge to healthcare system in Egypt.
32462497,This document is a position statement from the Egyptian Society of Cardiology.
32462497,It aims to provide information to cardiovascular healthcare providers in Egypt to guarantee delivery of quality patient care and ensure adequate levels of protection against infection during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32462497,Older patients and those with cardiovascular disease are at higher risk of mortality.
32462497,The current situation requires unusual allocation of resources which may negatively impact the care of patients with cardiovascular disease.
32462497,Cardiologists should be prepared in the COVID-19 pandemic.
32462497,The challenge is in providing the best quality of care despite limited resources while keeping all medical staff as safe as possible.
32462497,Consider deferring elective procedures whenever possible.
32462497,All medical staff should undergo rigorous training on infection control and the use of high-quality personal protection equipment.
32462497,Cardiologists should promote telemedicine in the outpatient setting, prioritize outpatient contacts, and avoid nosocomial dissemination of the virus to patients and healthcare providers.
32462497,A much conservative approach for emergent cardiac patients is recommended, and invasive interventions are reserved for high risk hemodynamically unstable patients.
32462497,During the pandemic, the most important principles of treatment should be controlling the spread of infection as the first priority, prompt assessment of patient risk, recommending conservative medical therapy rather than invasive interventions, and strict infection control measures to limit infection spread within the hospital and to healthcare workers.
32462545,The emergence of SARS-CoV-2/2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has created a global pandemic with no approved treatments or vaccines.
32462545,Many treatments have already been administered to COVID-19 patients but have not been systematically evaluated.
32462545,We performed a systematic literature review to identify all treatments reported to be administered to COVID-19 patients and to assess time to clinically meaningful response for treatments with sufficient data.
32462545,We searched PubMed, BioRxiv, MedRxiv, and ChinaXiv for articles reporting treatments for COVID-19 patients published between 1 December 2019 and 27 March 2020.
32462545,Data were analyzed descriptively.
32462545,Of the 2706 articles identified, 155 studies met the inclusion criteria, comprising 9152 patients.
32462545,The cohort was 45.4% female and 98.3% hospitalized, and mean (SD) age was 44.4 years (SD 21.0).
32462545,The most frequently administered drug classes were antivirals, antibiotics, and corticosteroids, and of the 115 reported drugs, the most frequently administered was combination lopinavir/ritonavir, which was associated with a time to clinically meaningful response (complete symptom resolution or hospital discharge) of 11.7 (1.09) days.
32462545,There were insufficient data to compare across treatments.
32462545,Many treatments have been administered to the first 9152 reported cases of COVID-19.
32462545,These data serve as the basis for an open-source registry of all reported treatments given to COVID-19 patients at www.CDCN.org/CORONA.
32462545,Further work is needed to prioritize drugs for investigation in well-controlled clinical trials and treatment protocols.
32462701,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 infections has led to substantial unmet need for treatments, many of which will require testing in appropriate animal models of this disease.
32462701,Vaccine trials are already underway, but there remains an urgent need to find other therapeutic approaches to either target SARS-CoV-2 or the complications arising from viral infection, particularly the dysregulated immune response and systemic complications which have been associated with progression to severe COVID-19.
32462701,At the time of writing, in vivo studies of SARS-CoV-2 infection have been described using macaques, cats, ferrets, hamsters, and transgenic mice expressing human angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
32462701,These infection models have already been useful for studies of transmission and immunity, but to date only partially model the mechanisms implicated in human severe COVID-19.
32462701,There is therefore an urgent need for development of animal models for improved evaluation of efficacy of drugs identified as having potential in the treatment of severe COVID-19.
32462701,These models need to recapitulate key mechanisms of COVID-19 severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and reproduce the immunopathology and systemic sequelae associated with this disease.
32462701,Here, we review the current models of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-related disease mechanisms and suggest ways in which animal models can be adapted to increase their usefulness in research into COVID-19 pathogenesis and for assessing potential treatments.
32462717,COVID-19 leads to mortality of several patients and the cytokine storm is reportedly critical in the patients.
32462717,In order to reduce the cytokine storm, we would like to propose the IL6 receptor antagonist therapy for the COVID-19 patients.
32462717,Two humanized monoclonal antibodies are in clinical trial following IL6R antagonist therapies namely tocilizumab and sarilumab.
32462717,However, researchers and physicians should look for more IL6 receptor antagonists for the therapy of cytokine storm syndrome SARS-CoV-2 infected persons to enhance the therapeutic options for cytokine storm.

32462719,In the midst of a worldwide pandemic of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), a paucity of data precludes derivation of COVID-19-specific recommendations for nutritional therapy.
32462719,Until more data are available, the focus needs to center on principles of critical care nutrition modified for the constraints of this disease process, i.e., COVID-19-relevant recommendations.
32462719,Delivery of nutritional therapy must include strategies to reduce exposure and spread of the disease by providing clustered care, adequate protection of healthcare providers, and preservation of personal protective equipment.
32462719,Enteral nutrition (EN) should be initiated early after admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) using a standard isosmolar polymeric formula, starting at trophic doses and advancing as tolerated while monitoring for gastrointestinal intolerance, hemodynamic instability, and metabolic derangements.
32462719,Intragastric EN may be provided safely, even with use of prone positioning and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.
32462719,Clinicians, though, should have a lower threshold for switching to parenteral nutrition in cases of intolerance, high risk of aspiration, or escalating vasopressor support.
32462719,While data extrapolated from experience in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) warrants use of fiber additives and probiotic organisms.
32462719,The lack of demonstrated benefit precludes a recommendation for micronutrient supplementation.
32462719,Practices which increase exposure or contamination of equipment, such as use of gastric residual volumes as a monitor, indirect calorimetry to calculate requirements, endoscopy or fluoroscopy to achieve enteral access, or transport out of the ICU for additional imaging should be avoided.
32462719,At all times, strategies for nutritional therapy need to be assessed on a risk/benefit basis, paying attention to risk for both the patient and the healthcare provider.

32462756,The coronavirus disease 2019 is currently of global concern.
32462756,Cancer patients are advised to stay at home in case of potential infection, which may cause delays of routine diagnosis and necessary treatment.
32462756,How colorectal surgeons should manage this during the epidemic remains a big challenge.
32462756,To evaluate the feasibility of routine colorectal surgery during coronavirus disease 2019 and to offer some Chinese recommendations to colorectal surgeons throughout the world.
32462756,A total of 166 patients receiving colorectal surgery from 20th December 2019 to 20th March 2020 at Department of General Surgery in Chinese General Hospital of People's Liberation Army were enrolled, and further divided into two groups based on before or after admission date of 20th January 2020.
32462756,Clinicopathologic data such as hospital stay and economic data such as total costs were collected and analyzed retrospectively.
32462756,Longer hospital stay, higher proportion of non-local patients and more hospitalization cost were found in the post-20 January group (special-time group) (P &lt; 0.001; P &lt; 0.05; P &lt; 0.05 respectively).
32462756,Apart from this, no difference existed with regard to baseline demographical data such as age, sex and height, as well as clinicopathological data such as previous history, surgery time, operation extent and TNM staging.
32462756,This real-world study indicated that performing colorectal surgery during coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic might be safe and feasible based on comprehensive screening and investigation.
32462756,We have summarized several recommendations here, hoping to help surgeons from related departments across the world.

32462841,Obesity represents a higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection, which may lead to the requirement of a mechanical ventilation in intensive care units and premature death.
32462841,The underlying mechanisms are multiple: alteration of the respiratory performance, presence of comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension or obstructive sleep apnea, finally inadequate and excessive immunological responses, possibly aggravated by ectopic intrathoracic fat depots.
32462841,Thus, COVID-19 may challenge the so-called « obesity paradox » commonly reported by intensivists in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome.
32462841,These findings require reinforced preventive and curative measures among obese patients to limit the risk of progression towards an unfavorable outcome in case of COVID-19.
32462841,L’obésité représente un risque accru d’infection COVID-19 sévère, amenant les patients en soins intensifs pour une assistance respiratoire avec risque de décès.
32462841,Les raisons en sont multiples : altération de la mécanique ventilatoire, présence de comorbidités comme le diabète, l’hypertension ou les apnées obstructives du sommeil, enfin, des réactions immunologique et inflammatoire inappropriées et excessives, possiblement encore accentuées par des dépôts de graisse ectopique intrathoraciques.
32462841,Ainsi, le COVID-19 pourrait remettre en cause le concept, appelé « obesity paradox », décrit par les médecins intensivistes chez les patients avec détresse respiratoire aiguë.
32462841,Ces données imposent de renforcer les mesures préventives et curatives chez les patients obèses pour limiter le risque d’évolution défavorable en cas de COVID-19.
32462858,The aim of the multicentre study promoted by Nuova FIO is to evaluate the beneficial effects of the systemic Oxygen-Ozone (O2O3) therapy in patients suffering from SARS COV-2 disease in the early phases of the disease, before worsening, up to the need of tracheal intubation.
32462858,The study is based on the rationale on that the systemic oxygen-ozone treatment could be effective, positively influencing the disease evolution and/or being able to mitigate the onset of the cytokine storm syndrome at least partially.
32462968,Prior research on nanotechnologies in diagnostics, prevention and treatment of coronavirus infections is reviewed.
32462968,Gold nanoparticles and semiconductor quantum dots in colorimetric and immunochromatographic assays, silica nanoparticles in a polymerase chain reaction and spike protein nanospheres as antigen carriers and adjuvants in vaccine formulations present notable examples in diagnostics and prevention, while uses of nanoparticles in coronavirus infection treatments have been merely sporadic.
32462968,The current absence of antiviral therapeutics that specifically target human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, might be largely due to the underuse of nanotechnologies.
32462968,Elucidating the interface between nanoparticles and coronaviruses is timely, but presents the only route to the rational design of precisely targeted therapeutics for coronavirus infections.
32462968,Such a fundamental approach is also a viable prophylaxis against future pandemics of this type.
32462970,SARS-CoV-2 is causative agent of COVID 19, which is responsible for severe social and economic disruption globally.
32462970,Lack of vaccine or antiviral drug with clinical efficacy suggested that drug repurposing approach may provide a quick therapeutic solution to COVID19.
32462970,Nonstructural Protein-15 (NSP15) encodes for an uridylate-specific endoribonuclease (EndoU) enzyme, essential for virus life cycle and an attractive target for drug development.
32462970,We have performed <i>in silico</i> based virtual screening of FDA approved compounds targeting EndoU in search of COVID19 drugs from commercially available approved molecules.
32462970,Two drugs Glisoxepide and Idarubicin used for treatment for diabetes and leukemia respectively were selected as stronger binder of EndoU.
32462970,Both the drugs bound to the active site of the viral endonuclease by forming attractive intermolecular interactions with catalytically essential amino acid residues, His235, His250 and Lys290.
32462970,Molecular dynamics simulation studies showed stable conformation dynamics upon drugs binding to endoU.
32462970,The binding free energies for Glisoxepide and Idarubicin were calculated to be -141 ± 11 and -136 ± 16 kJ/mol respectively.
32462970,The IC<sub>50</sub> were predicted to be 9.2µM and 30µM for Glisoxepide and Idarubicin respectively.
32462970,Comparative structural analysis showed the stronger binding of EndoU to Glisoxepide and Idarubicin than uridine monophosphate (UMP).
32462970,Surface area calculations showed buried are of 361.8Å<sup>2</sup> by Glisoxepide which is almost double of the area occupied by UMP suggesting stronger binding of the drug than the ribonucleotide.
32462970,However, further studies on these drugs for evaluation of their clinical efficacy and dose formulations may be required, which may provide a quick therapeutic option to treat COVID-19.<b>Abbreviation</b>: COVID-19: Coronavirus Disease 2019; PCA: Principal Component Analysis; MD: Molecular Dynamics; MM/PBSA: Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area; nCoV: Novel Coronavirus; PME: Particle-Mesh Ewald; RMSD: Root Mean Square Deviations; RMSF: Root Mean Square Fluctuations; SARS-CoV-2: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2; SASA: Solvent Accessible Surface Area; SPC: Simple Point Charge.
32462984,The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused significant mortality around the world and the focus has been on reducing the number of infections.
32462984,In order not to compromise treatment of oncology patients, reducing the number of patients with COVID-19 undergoing treatment is mandatory.
32462984,We reviewed the experience of the National Institute of Cancer in Milan and compared it with our experience.
32462988,The rapid global spread of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has created an unprecedented healthcare crisis.
32462988,The treatment for the severe respiratory illness caused by this virus is primarily symptomatic at this point, although the usage of a broad antiviral drug Remdesivir has been allowed on emergency basis by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
32462988,The ever-increasing death toll highlights an urgent need for development of specific antivirals.
32462988,In this work, we have utilized docking and simulation methods to identify small molecule inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Membrane (M) and Envelope (E) proteins, which are essential for virus assembly and budding.
32462988,A total of 70 compounds from an Indian medicinal plant source (<i>Azadirachta indica</i> or Neem) were virtually screened against these two proteins and further analyzed with molecular dynamics simulations, which resulted in the identification of a few common compounds with strong binding to both structural proteins.
32462988,The compounds bind to biologically critical regions of M and E, indicating their potential to inhibit the functionality of these components.
32462988,We hope that our computational approach may result in the identification of effective inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 assembly.
32463077,The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services should immediately update current policies to include reimbursement for Medicare patients receiving intravenous antibiotics at home.
32463077,The majority of these patients are over the age of 65 and at increased risk for severe illness due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32463077,Requiring them to travel to an infusion center, stay in a skilled nursing facility or remain in the hospital longer than necessary to receive treatment results in avoidable risk of exposure amidst a pandemic.
32463077,Current policy has significant implications for increased cost and harm to both these patients and the US healthcare system.
32463204,The Emergency Department in Trondheim has prepared for a large influx of patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
32463204,We conducted a study comparing patients in the Emergency Department in the first weeks of the pandemic in Norway (weeks 11 and 12) with the average number of patient visits.
32463204,Data from patients at the Emergency Department of St Olav's Hospital in the period 6 January 2020-22 March 2020 were retrieved from the Emergency Department's database.
32463204,Logistical patient data concerning patient numbers, chief complaints, length of stay in the Emergency Department, acuity level, isolation status, and treatment level were analysed.
32463204,In week 12, 331 patients were referred to the Emergency Department, a reduction of 39 % compared with the average of 541 patients in weeks 2-10.
32463204,There was a general reduction in all patient groups, but particularly those discharged from the Emergency Department.
32463204,In week 12 there were 56 more patients isolated with suspected/potentially infectious disease (187 %) compared with the average for weeks 2-10, and these patients spent almost two hours longer in the Emergency Department than other patients.
32463204,There was a reduction in patient visits to the Emergency Department in the first weeks of the pandemic.
32463204,The percentage of patients isolated for infection control increased, and the time spent in the Emergency Department for these patients was greater than for other patients.
32463204,The reduction in the inflow of patients is expected to be temporary, and the Emergency Department at St Olav's Hospital expects a large influx of patients with suspected COVID-19 disease.
32463221,Higher rates of serious illness and death from coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection among older people and those who have comorbidities suggest that age- and disease-related biological processes make such individuals more sensitive to environmental stress factors including infectious agents like coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
32463221,Specifically, impaired redox homeostasis and associated oxidative stress appear to be important biological processes that may account for increased individual susceptibility to diverse environmental insults.
32463221,The aim of this Viewpoint is to justify (1) the crucial roles of glutathione in determining individual responsiveness to COVID-19 infection and disease pathogenesis and (2) the feasibility of using glutathione as a means for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 illness.
32463221,The hypothesis that glutathione deficiency is the most plausible explanation for serious manifestation and death in COVID-19 patients was proposed on the basis of an exhaustive literature analysis and observations.
32463221,The hypothesis unravels the mysteries of epidemiological data on the risk factors determining serious manifestations of COVID-19 infection and the high risk of death and opens real opportunities for effective treatment and prevention of the disease.
32463289,The COVID-19 pandemic has caused many Veterans Healthcare Administration providers working with veterans diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder to question the feasibility and appropriateness of continuing to provide trauma-focused treatment during this crisis.
32463289,The Veterans Healthcare Administration is in a unique position to continue to provide trauma-informed care because of its capacity to offer telemental health services.
32463289,Data from a Veterans Affairs medical center's posttraumatic stress disorder clinical team suggest that not only are veterans interested in continuing with treatment but also that the treatments can be modified to accommodate the current climate.

32463308,The SARS-Cov-2 viral pandemic causing COVID-19 disease begs for rapid and innovative treatments.
32463308,In addition to flu-like respiratory symptoms, acute cardiac manifestations include cardiac injury, shock and arrhythmia.
32463308,Several pharmacological therapies have been suggested including repurposing of existing drugs such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, sometimes co-administered with azithromycin.
32463308,Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine were developed in the World War II era for treatment and prophylaxis of malaria, long before modern drug safety surveillance programs.
32463308,Clinically they can prolong the QT interval to potentially initiate ventricular arrhythmias including torsades de pointes, and also cause QRS widening.
32463308,Chloroquine interacts with multiple cardiac ion channels including the hERG potassium channel that is essential for normal electrical activity in the heart.
32463308,A reduction in hERG channel potassium current is the principle cause of drug-induced long QT syndrome.
32463308,Azithromycin also can cause modest QT interval prolongation, but not through potent hERG channel blockade, rather when used chronically through an increase in peak and late cardiac sodium current to cause potential loading of cardiomyocytes with sodium and calcium to produce calcium overload.
32463308,How should we proceed with the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, potentially combined with azithromycin, for COVID-19 given that these agents bring some cardiac toxicity risk and their mechanisms for cardiac toxicity may not be the same?
32463308,Is combining different and potentially additive mechanisms of cardiotoxicity wise?
32463308,How great the risk is relative to the benefit in critically ill COVID-19 patients will need to await the outcome of ongoing, controlled clinical trials.
32463348,Background Despite a lack of clinical evidence, hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin are being administered widely to patients with verified or suspected COVID-19.
32463348,Both drugs may increase risk of lethal arrhythmias associated with QT interval prolongation.
32463348,Methods and Results We performed a case series of COVID-19 positive/suspected patients admitted between 2/1/2020 and 4/4/2020 who were treated with azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine, or a combination.
32463348,We evaluated baseline and post-medication QT interval (QTc, Bazett's) using 12-lead ECGs.
32463348,Critical QTc prolongation was defined as: a) maximum QTc ≥500 ms (if QRS &lt;120 ms) or QTc ≥550 ms (if QRS ≥120 ms) and b) increased QTc of ≥60 ms.
32463348,Tisdale score and Elixhauser comorbidity index were calculated.
32463348,Of 490 COVID-19 positive/suspected patients, 314 (64%) received either/both drugs, and 98 (73 COVID-19 positive, 25 suspected) met study criteria (age 62±17 yrs, 61% male).
32463348,Azithromycin was prescribed in 28%, hydroxychloroquine in 10%, and both in 62%.
32463348,Baseline mean QTc was 448±29 ms and increased to 459±36 ms (p=0.005) with medications.
32463348,Significant prolongation was observed only in men (18±43 ms vs -0.2±28 ms in women, p=0.02). 12% of patients reached critical QTc prolongation.
32463348,Changes in QTc were highest with the combination compared to either drug, with much greater prolongation with combination vs. azithromycin (17±39 vs.
32463348,0.5±40 ms, p=0.07).
32463348,No patients manifested torsades de pointes.
32463348,Conclusions Overall 12% of patients manifested critical QTc prolongation, and the combination caused greater prolongation than either drug alone.
32463348,The balance between uncertain benefit and potential risk when treating COVID-19 patients should be carefully assessed.
32463377,On the 12th March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the COVID-19 virus outbreak as a pandemic.
32463377,On that date there were 134,576 reported cases and 4,981 deaths worldwide.
32463377,By 26th March, just two weeks later, reported cases had increased fourfold to 531,865 and deaths fivefold to 24,073.
32463377,Older people are both major users of telehealth services and are more likely to die as a result of COVID-19.
32463377,This paper examines the extent to which Australia, the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (US) during the two weeks following the pandemic announcement, sought to promote telehealth as a tool that could help identify COVID-19 among older people who may live alone, be frail and/or be self-isolating; and give support or facilitate the treatment of people who are or maybe infected.
32463377,The paper reports, for the two-week period or immediately prior, on activities and initiatives in the three countries taken by governments or their agencies (at national or state levels); together with publications of or guidance issued by professional, trade and charitable bodies.
32463377,Different sources of information are drawn upon that point to the perceived likely benefits of telehealth in fighting the pandemic.
32463377,It is not the purpose of this paper to draw together or analyse information that reflects growing knowledge about COVID-19, except where telehealth is seen as a component.
32463377,The picture that emerges for the three countries, based on the sources identified, shows a number of differences.
32463377,These differences centre on the nature of their health services; the extent of attention given to older people (and the circumstances that can relate to them); the different geographies (notably concerned with rurality) and the changes to funding frameworks that impact on these.
32463377,Common to all three countries is the value attributed to maintaining quality safeguards in the wider context of their health services but where such services are noted as sometimes having precluded significant telehealth use.
32463377,The COVID-19 pandemic is forcing changes and may help to establish telehealth more firmly in its aftermath.
32463377,Some of the changes may not be long-lasting.
32463377,However, the momentum is such that telehealth will almost certainly find a stronger place within health service frameworks for each of the three countries and is likely to have increased acceptance among both patients and healthcare providers.
32463478,The treatment of patients with cancer who test positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses unique challenges.
32463478,In this commentary, the authors describe the ethical rationale and implementation details for the creation of a novel, multidisciplinary treatment prioritization committee, including physicians, frontline staff, an ethicist, and an infectious disease expert.
32463478,Organizational obligations to health care workers also are discussed.
32463478,The treatment prioritization committee sets a threshold of acceptable harm to patients from decreased cancer control that is justified to reduce risk to staff.
32463478,The creation of an ethical, consistent, and transparent decision-making process involving such frontline stakeholders is essential as departments across the country are faced with decisions regarding the treatment of SARS-CoV-2-positive patients with cancer.
32463545,The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 run from asymptomatic disease to severe acute respiratory syndrome.
32463545,Older age and comorbidities are associated to more severe disease.
32463545,A role of obesity is suspected.
32463545,We enrolled patients hospitalized in the medical COVID-19 ward with SARS-CoV-2 related pneumonia.
32463545,Primary outcome of the study was to assess the relationship between the severity of COVID-19 and obesity classes according to BMI. 92 patients (61.9% males; age 70.5±13.3 years) were enrolled.
32463545,Patients with overweight and obesity were younger than normal-weight patients (68.0±12.6 and 67.0±12.6 years vs.
32463545,76.1±13.0 years, p&lt;0.01).
32463545,A higher need for assisted ventilation beyond pure oxygen support (Invasive Mechanical Ventilation or Non-Invasive Ventilation) and a higher admission to intensive or semi-intensive care units was observed in patients with overweight and obesity (p&lt;0.01 and p &lt; 0.05, respectively) even after adjusting for sex, age and comorbidities (p&lt;0.05 and p&lt;0.001, respectively), or when patients with dementia or advanced cancer were removed from the analysis (p&lt;0.05).
32463545,Patients with overweight and obesity admitted in a medical ward for SARS-CoV-2 related pneumonia, despite their younger age, required more frequently assisted ventilation and access to intensive or semi-intensive care units than normal weight patients.
32463803,Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is an emerging infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2.
32463803,Anti-viral immune response is crucial to achieve pathogen clearance, however in some patients an excessive and aberrant host immune response can lead to an acute respiratory distress syndrome.
32463803,The comprehension of the mechanisms that regulate pathogen elimination, immunity, and pathology is essential to better characterize disease progression and widen the spectrum of therapeutic options.
32463803,We performed a flow cytometric characterization of immune cells subsets from 30 COVID-19 patients and correlated these data with clinical outcomes.
32463803,COVID-19 patients showed decreased numbers of circulating T, B and NK cells, and exhibited a skewing of CD8+ T cells towards a terminally differentiated/senescent phenotype.
32463803,In agreement, T CD4+, T CD8+ but also NK cells displayed reduced anti-viral cytokine production capability.
32463803,Moreover, a reduced cytotoxic potential was identified in COVID-19 patients, particularly in those that required intensive care.
32463803,The latter group of patients showed also increased serum IL-6 levels, that correlated to the frequency of granzyme-expressing NK cells.
32463803,Off-label treatment with tocilizumab restored the cytotoxic potential of NK cells.
32463803,In conclusion, the association between IL-6 serum levels and the impairment of cytotoxic activity suggests the possibility that targeting this cytokine may restore anti-viral mechanisms.
32463803,This study was supported by funds of Dept. of Experimental and Clinical Medicine of University of Florence (ex-60%) derived from Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Università e della Ricerca (Italy).
32464095,In the midst of a global public health emergency, some businesses are taking advantage of widespread fears by marketing purported stem cell treatments for COVID-19.
32464095,Such businesses target prospective clients with misleading claims, expose patients to potentially risky stem cell-based products, and undermine efforts to develop evidence-based treatments for COVID-19.
32464097,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32464097,Without approved antiviral therapeutics or vaccines to this ongoing global threat, type I and type III interferons (IFNs) are currently being evaluated for their efficacy.
32464097,Both the role of IFNs and the use of recombinant IFNs in two related, highly pathogenic coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, have been controversial in terms of their protective effects in the host.
32464097,In this review, we describe the recent progress in our understanding of both type I and type III IFN-mediated innate antiviral responses against human coronaviruses and discuss the potential use of IFNs as a treatment strategy for COVID-19.
32464098,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has had devastating global impacts and will continue to have dramatic effects on public health for years to come.
32464098,A better understanding of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 will be critical for the application and development of therapeutics.
32464098,The degree to which the innate immune response confers protection or induces pathogenesis through a dysregulated immune response remains unclear.
32464098,In this review, we discuss what is known about the role of the innate immune system during SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggest directions for future studies, and evaluate proposed COVID-19 immunomodulating therapeutics.
32464333,Several studies have demonstrated the advantages of environmental surveillance through the monitoring of sewage for the assessment of viruses circulating in a given community (wastewater-based epidemiology, WBE).
32464333,During the COVID-19 public health emergency, many reports have described the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in stools from COVID-19 patients, and a few studies reported the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewaters worldwide.
32464333,Italy is among the world's worst-affected countries in the COVID-19 pandemic, but so far there are no studies assessing the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in Italian wastewaters.
32464333,To this aim, twelve influent sewage samples, collected between February and April 2020 from Wastewater Treatment Plants in Milan and Rome, were tested adapting, for concentration, the standard WHO procedure for Poliovirus surveillance.
32464333,Molecular analysis was undertaken with three nested protocols, including a newly designed SARS-CoV-2 specific primer set.
32464333,SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection was accomplished in volumes of 250 ml of wastewaters collected in areas of high (Milan) and low (Rome) epidemic circulation, according to clinical data.
32464333,Overall, 6 out of 12 samples were positive.
32464333,One of the positive results was obtained in a Milan wastewater sample collected a few days after the first notified Italian case of autochthonous SARS-CoV-2.
32464333,The study confirms that WBE has the potential to be applied to SARS-CoV-2 as a sensitive tool to study spatial and temporal trends of virus circulation in the population.
32464584,SARS-CoV-2 viral infection causes COVID-19 that can result in severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which can cause significant mortality, leading to concern that immunosuppressive treatments for multiple sclerosis and other disorders have significant risks for both infection and ARDS.
32464584,To examine the biology that potentially underpins immunity to the SARS-Cov-2 virus and the immunity-induced pathology related to COVID-19 and determine how this impinges on the use of current disease modifying treatments in multiple sclerosis.
32464584,Although information about the mechanisms of immunity are scant, it appears that monocyte/macrophages and then CD8 T cells are important in eliminating the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
32464584,This may be facilitated via anti-viral antibody responses that may prevent re-infection.
32464584,However, viral escape and infection of leucocytes to promote lymphopenia, apparent CD8 T cell exhaustion coupled with a cytokine storm and vascular pathology appears to contribute to the damage in ARDS.
32464584,In contrast to ablative haematopoietic stem cell therapy, most multiple-sclerosis-related disease modifying therapies do not particularly target the innate immune system and few have any major long-term impact on CD8 T cells to limit protection against COVID-19.
32464584,In addition, few block the formation of immature B cells within lymphoid tissue that will provide antibody-mediated protection from (re)infection.
32464584,However, adjustments to dosing schedules may help de-risk the chance of infection further and reduce the concerns of people with MS being treated during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32464585,The new severe acute respiratory syndrome- coronavirus 2 is reported to affect the nervous system.
32464585,Among the reports of the various neurological manifestations, there are a few documented specific processes to explain the neurological signs.
32464585,We report a para-infectious encephalitis patient with clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings during evolution and convalescence phase of coronavirus infection.
32464585,This comprehensive overview can illuminate the natural history of similar cases.
32464585,As the two previously reported cases of encephalitis associated with this virus were not widely discussed regarding the treatment, we share our successful approach and add some recommendations about this new and scarce entity.
32464624,The real issue with the COVID-19 pandemic is that a rapidly increasing number of patients with life-threatening complications are admitted in hospitals and are not well-administered.
32464624,Although a limited number of patients use the intensive care unit (ICU), they consume medical resources, safety equipment, and enormous equipment with little possibility of rapid recovery and ICU discharge.
32464624,This work reviews effective methods of using filtration devices in treatment to reduce the level of various inflammatory mediators and discharge patients from the ICU faster.
32464624,Extracorporeal technologies have been reviewed as a medical approach to absorb cytokines.
32464624,Although these devices do not kill or remove the virus, they are a promising solution for treating patients and their faster removal from the ICU, thus relieving the bottleneck.
32464637,The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is a healthcare crisis caused by insufficient knowledge applicable to effectively combat the virus.
32464637,Therefore, different scientific discovery strategies need to be connected, to generate a rational treatment which can be made available as rapidly as possible.
32464637,This relies on a solid theoretical understanding of the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and host responses, which is coupled to the practical experience of clinicians that are treating patients.
32464637,Because SARS-CoV-2 enters the cell by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), targeting ACE2 to prevent such binding seems an obvious strategy to combat infection.
32464637,However, ACE2 performs its functions outside the cell and was found to enter the cell only by angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R)-induced endocytosis, after which ACE2 is destroyed.
32464637,This means that preventing uptake of ACE2 into the cell by blocking AT1R would be a more logical approach to limit entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the cell.
32464637,Since ACE2 plays an important protective role in maintaining key biological processes, treatments should not disrupt the functional capacity of ACE2, to counterbalance the negative effects of the infection.
32464637,Based on known mechanisms and knowledge of the characteristics of SARS-CoV we propose the hypothesis that the immune system facilitates SARS-CoV-2 replication which disrupts immune regulatory mechanisms.
32464637,The proposed mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 causes disease immediately suggests a possible treatment, since the AT1R is a key player in this whole process.
32464637,AT1R antagonists appear to be the ideal candidate for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32464637,AT1R antagonists counterbalance the negative consequences of angiotesnin II and, in addition, they might even be involved in preventing the cellular uptake of the virus without interfering with ACE2 function.
32464637,AT1R antagonists are widely available, cheap, and safe.
32464637,Therefore, we propose to consider using AT1R antagonists in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
32464662,The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has exacerbated staffing challenges already facing critical care nurses in intensive care units.
32464662,Many intensive care units have been understaffed and the majority of nurses working in these units have little experience.
32464662,To describe how the skilled tele-intensive care unit nurses in our health system quickly changed from a patient-focused strategy to a clinician-focused approach during the coronavirus disease 2019 crisis.
32464662,We modified workflows, deployed home workstations, and changed staffing models with the goal of providing additional clinical support to bedside colleagues while reducing exposure time and conserving personal protective equipment for those caring for this highly contagious patient population.
32464662,The unit changed focus and granted more than 300 clinicians access to technology that enabled them to care for patients remotely, added nearly 200 mobile carts, and allowed more than 20 tele-intensive care unit nurses to work from home.
32464662,Tele-intensive care unit nursing provided clinical knowledge to the nurses covering current and expanded critical care units.
32464662,Using technology, virtual rounding, and increased collaboration with nurses, tele-intensive care unit nursing minimized the risk to bedside nurses while maintaining a high level of care for patients.
32464662,Tele-intensive care unit nurses provided a proactive, holistic approach to caring for critically ill patients via camera as part of their routine workflow.
32464662,In addition, during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, these nurses created a new strategy in virtual health care to be implemented during a crisis.
32464670,The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic poses major challenges for the entire medical care system.
32464670,Especially in university institutions as maximum care providers, a higher exposure to potentially infectious patients or actual COVID19 patients is to be expected.
32464670,In a short period of time, an operational concept had to be developed regarding the current hygiene recommendations of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), the leading medical societies and the internal hospital hygiene plan.
32464670,Here, patient safety and employee protection are equally important.In cooperation with the Institute for Medical Microbiology and Hospital Hygiene and the occupational medical service, interventions were defined to develop solutions to minimize the COVID-19 transmission risk for examiners and patients despite limited diagnostic and equipment resources.
32464670,For this purpose, an operational concept was developed, consisting of various individual actions, e. g. the reduction of outpatient treatment to emergencies, life-threatening diseases and urgent aftercare, a double triage of patients and the introduction of treatment teams.The newly developed operational concept was successfully implemented within a few days.
32464670,After the initial rollout and several &quot;hygiene inspections&quot; only minor improvements to the concept were necessary.
32464670,All measures were documented in the internal quality handbook and are accessible to all employees.
32464670,Since the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is a dynamic process with regular changes in the development and information status, the operational concept is regularly reviewed for validity and adjusted as necessary.
32464670,Die SARS-CoV-2-Pandemie stellt das gesamte medizinische Versorgungssystem vor große Herausforderungen.
32464670,Gerade in universitären Einrichtungen als Maximalversorger ist eine höhere Exposition zu potenziell infektiösen Patienten oder tatsächlichen COVID-19-Kranken zu erwarten.
32464670,Es musste kurzfristig ein Betriebskonzept entwickelt werden, das den aktuellen Hygiene-Empfehlungen des Robert Koch-Instituts (RKI), den Empfehlungen der führenden Fachgesellschaften und dem daraus abgeleiteten internen Hygieneplan entsprach.
32464670,Hierbei sind die Patientensicherheit und der Mitarbeiterschutz gleichermaßen zu beachten.In Zusammenarbeit mit dem Institut für Medizinische Mikrobiologie und Krankenhaushygiene sowie dem Betriebsärztlichen Dienst wurden Maßnahmen festgelegt, um trotz begrenzter diagnostischer und Ausrüstungsressourcen Lösungen zu erarbeiten, um die COVID-19-Übertragungsgefahr für Untersucher und Patienten zu minimieren.
32464670,Hierzu wurde ein Betriebskonzept erarbeitet, das aus verschiedenen Einzelmaßnahmen bestand, wie z.
32464670,B. der Reduktion der ambulanten Patientenbehandlung auf Notfälle, lebensbedrohliche Erkrankungen und dringliche Nachsorgen, eine Doppeltriage von Patienten sowie die Einführung von Behandlungsteams.Das neue erarbeitete Betriebskonzept konnte erfolgreich innerhalb weniger Tage umgesetzt werden.
32464670,Nach ersten Erfahrungen aus dem Realbetrieb und mehreren „Hygienebegehungen“ waren lediglich geringfügige Nachbesserungen des Konzeptes erforderlich.
32464670,Alle Maßnahmen wurden schriftlich im klinikinternen Qualitätshandbuch dokumentiert und sind allen Mitarbeitern zugänglich.
32464670,Da es sich bei der SARS-CoV-2-Pandemie um einen dynamischen Prozess mit regelmäßiger Änderung des Entwicklungs- und Informationsstandes handelt, wird das Betriebskonzept regelmäßig neu auf Gültigkeit überprüft und ggf. angepasst.
32464700,Most high-income countries are aggressively engaged in the collection and research evaluation of convalescent plasma as a specific passive immunotherapy for treatment of COVID-19.
32464700,Preliminary clinical data fully support such initiatives.
32464700,Outbreaks of COVID-19 are now dramatically affecting LMIC, which have restricted capability for ensuring organized and controlled collection of safe blood and plasma collection due to fragmented blood systems with limited oversight, infrastructure, equipment, and trained personnel.
32464700,Nevertheless, there is an urgent effort in LMIC to provide COVID-19 convalescent plasma as a potentially effective therapy that can be produced locally.
32464700,The Working Party on Global Blood Safety of the International Society of Blood Transfusion has published &quot;Points to consider in the preparation and transfusion of COVID-19 convalescent plasma in low- and middle- income countries&quot;.
32464700,The purpose of this commentary is to provide an urgent general frame of ethical and technical recommendations on the use of convalescent plasma to treat patients affected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus in LMIC.
32464700,Key ethical, quality, and safety guidance for the selection of donors, the collection and processing of blood, and the transfusion of COVID-19 convalescent plasma should be followed.
32464700,Governments should be reminded that an adequate supply of quality and safe blood components for transfusion is essential to meet the primary healthcare needs of the population.
32464700,The response to the COVID-19 epidemic highlights the importance of capacity building for an organized and sustainable national blood system while steps are taken to provide appropriately collected, tested and processed COVID-19 convalescent plasma for investigational clinical use.
32466392,Pending the availability of vaccines to contain the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the current solution is &quot;social distancing&quot; with a reduction of dental treatments to those assessed as urgent and emergency cases.
32466392,These treatments also involve Early Childhood Caries (ECC) due to the fact that this disease affects preschool children (a vulnerable population) and, in addition, shows a propensity to evolve into more serious complications (dental pain, infections).
32466392,A narrative review was carried out to support a protocol for treating ECC with efficacious and safe (in terms of SARS-CoV-2 transmission) procedures.
32466392,Protocol involves criteria for patients' selection remotely (telemedicine), and well-detailed criteria/equipment and hygiene procedures to combat against SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
32466392,Moreover, the protocol proposes innovative caries treatments, named Minimally Invasive Treatments (MITs), well known in pedodontics for their high level of children's acceptance during dental care.
32466392,MITs allow for caries removal (particularly in primary teeth) without any high-speed rotating instrument cooled with nebulized air-water spray (with high risk of virus environmental diffusion), usually adopted during traditional treatments.
32466392,For evaluating MITs effectiveness in caries management, only Systematic Review and Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) were included in our study, without any risk of bias assessment.
32466392,The indications proposed in this protocol could support clinicians for the temporary management of ECC until the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic ends.
32466536,Graphene-based materials are intriguing nanomaterials with applications ranging from nanotechnology-related devices to drug delivery systems and biosensing.
32466536,Multifunctional graphene platforms were proposed for the detection of several typical biomarkers (i.e., circulating tumor cells, exosomes, circulating nucleic acids, etc.) in liquid biopsy, and numerous methods, including optical, electrochemical, surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), etc., have been developed for their detection.
32466536,Due to the massive advancements in biology, material chemistry, and analytical technology, it is necessary to review the progress in this field from both medical and chemical sides.
32466536,Liquid biopsy is considered a revolutionary technique that is opening unexpected perspectives in the early diagnosis and, in therapy monitoring, severe diseases, including cancer, metabolic syndrome, autoimmune, and neurodegenerative disorders.
32466536,Although nanotechnology based on graphene has been poorly applied for the rapid diagnosis of viral diseases, the extraordinary properties of graphene (i.e., high electronic conductivity, large specific area, and surface functionalization) can be also exploited for the diagnosis of emerging viral diseases, such as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32466536,This review aimed to provide a comprehensive and in-depth summarization of the contribution of graphene-based nanomaterials in liquid biopsy, discussing the remaining challenges and the future trend; moreover, the paper gave the first look at the potentiality of graphene in COVID-19 diagnosis.
32466736,Higher rates of strokes have been observed in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but data regarding the outcomes of COVID-19 patients suffering from acute ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion (LVO) are lacking.
32466736,We report our initial experience in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke with LVO in patients with COVID-19.
32466736,All consecutive patients with COVID-19 with acute ischemic stroke due to LVO treated in our institution during the 6 first weeks of the COVID-19 outbreak were included.
32466736,Baseline clinical and radiological findings, treatment, and short-term outcomes are reported.
32466736,We identified 10 patients with confirmed COVID-19 treated for an acute ischemic stroke due to LVO.
32466736,Eight were men, with a median age of 59.5 years.
32466736,Seven had none or mild symptoms of COVID-19 at stroke onset.
32466736,Median time from COVID-19 symptoms to stroke onset was 6 days.
32466736,All patients had brain imaging within 3 hours from symptoms onset.
32466736,Five patients had multi-territory LVO.
32466736,Five received intravenous alteplase.
32466736,All patients had mechanical thrombectomy.
32466736,Nine patients achieved successful recanalization (mTICI2B-3), none experienced early neurological improvement, 4 had early cerebral reocclusion, and a total of 6 patients (60%) died in the hospital.
32466736,Best medical care including early intravenous thrombolysis, and successful and prompt recanalization achieved with mechanical thrombectomy, resulted in poor outcomes in patients with COVID-19.
32466736,Although our results require further confirmation, a different pharmacological approach (antiplatelet or other) should be investigated to take in account inflammatory and coagulation disorders associated with COVID-19.
32466738,Emergency measures to treat patients with coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and contain the outbreak is the main priority in each of our hospitals; however, these measures are likely to result in collateral damage among patients with other acute diseases.
32466738,Here, we investigate whether the COVID-19 pandemic affects acute stroke care through interruptions in the stroke chain of survival.
32466738,A descriptive analysis of acute stroke care activity before and after the COVID-19 outbreak is given for a stroke network in southern Europe.
32466738,To quantify the impact of the pandemic, the number of stroke code activations, ambulance transfers, consultations through telestroke, stroke unit admissions, and reperfusion therapy times and rates are described in temporal relationship with the rising number of COVID-19 cases in the region.
32466738,Following confinement of the population, our stroke unit activity decreased sharply, with a 25% reduction in admitted cases (mean number of 58 cases every 15 days in previous months to 44 cases in the 15 days after the outbreak, <i>P</i>&lt;0.001).
32466738,Consultations to the telestroke network declined from 25 every 15 days before the outbreak to 7 after the outbreak (<i>P</i>&lt;0.001).
32466738,The increasing trend in the prehospital diagnosis of stroke activated by 911 calls stopped abruptly in the region, regressing to 2019 levels.
32466738,The mean number of stroke codes dispatched to hospitals decreased (78% versus 57%, <i>P</i>&lt;0.001).
32466738,Time of arrival from symptoms onset to stroke units was delayed &gt;30 minutes, reperfusion therapy cases fell, and door-to-needle time started 16 minutes later than usual.
32466738,The COVID-19 pandemic is disruptive for acute stroke pathways.
32466738,Bottlenecks in the access and delivery of patients to our secured stroke centers are among the main challenges.
32466738,It is critical to encourage patients to continue seeking emergency care if experiencing acute stroke symptoms and to ensure that emergency professionals continue to use stroke code activation and telestroke networks.
32466995,The COVID-19 pandemic is an extraordinary global situation, and all countries have adopted their own strategies to diminish and eliminate the spread of the virus.
32466995,All measures are in line with the recommendations provided by the World Health Organization.
32466995,Scientific societies, such as the European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology and American Society for Reproductive Medicine, have provided recommendations and guidance to overcome and flatten the growing curve of infection in patients who undergo IVF treatments.
32466995,Although there is as yet no evidence that the virus causing COVID-19 might have negative effects on IVF outcomes, fertility treatments have been postponed in order to support healthcare systems by avoiding placing them under additional stress.
32466995,The possibility of the virus affecting sperm function and egg performance cannot be excluded.
32466995,In addition, an indirect effect of the virus on gametes and embryos during their manipulation cannot be ruled out.
32466995,This commentary aims to provide some ideas on the possible effect of the virus on gametes and embryos, as well as how it could affect the normal functioning of the embryology laboratory.
32467007,Because treatment options for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are very limited, the use of convalescent plasma has bee explored.
32467007,A male centenarian with cough and dyspnea for 2 months was diagnosed with COVID-19.
32467007,Without effective treatments and with the increased risks of antiviral therapy for the elderly, this patient was given convalescent plasma.
32467007,The viral load, complete blood count, inflammatory indicators, vital signs, and clinical symptoms were observed before and after COVID-19 convalescent plasma transfusion.
32467007,After convalescent plasma transfusion, significant improvement was observed on laboratory indicators and clinical symptoms of the patient.
32467007,Concurrently, SARS-CoV-2 viral load decreased sharply after the first transfusion (from 2.55 × 104 to 1.39 × 103 copies/mL) and became undetectable after the second transfusion.
32467007,With the substantial increase of COVID-19 in recent months,treatment for elderly patients has become restricted in some countries.
32467007,The successful treatment of this 100-year-old patient using convalescent plasma suggests that we should consider adding convalescent plasma in th management of the elderly.
32467101,The spread of pandemic COVID-19 has created unprecedented need for information.
32467101,The pandemic is the cause of significant mortality and with this the need for rapidly disseminated information for palliative care professionals regarding the prevalence of symptoms, their intensity, their resistance or susceptibility to symptom control and the mode of death for patients.
32467101,We undertook a systematic review of published evidence for symptoms in patients with COVID-19 (with a specific emphasis on symptoms at end of life) and on modes of death.
32467101,Inclusion: prospective or retrospective studies detailing symptom presence and/or cause or mode of death from COVID-19. 12 papers met the inclusion criteria and gave details of symptom burden: four of these specifically in the dying and two detailed the cause or mode of death.
32467101,Cough, breathlessness, fatigue and myalgia are significant symptoms in people hospitalised with COVID-19.
32467101,Dyspnoea is the most significant symptom in the dying.
32467101,The mode of death was described in two papers and is predominantly through respiratory or heart failure.
32467101,There remains a dearth of information regarding symptom burden and mode of death to inform decisions regarding end-of-life care in patients dying with COVID-19.
32467101,Rapid data gathering on the mode of death and the profile of symptoms in the dying and their prevalence and severity in areas where COVID-19 is prevalent will provide important intelligence for clinicians.
32467101,This should be done urgently, within ethical norms and the practicalities of a public health, clinical and logistical emergency.
32467359,The outbreak of COVID-19 has spread across the world and was characterized as a pandemic.
32467359,To protect medical laboratory personnel from infection, most laboratories inactivate the clinical samples before testing.
32467359,However, the effect of inactivation on the detection results remains unknown.
32467359,Here, we used a digital PCR assay to determine the absolute SARS-CoV-2 RNA copy number in 63 nasopharyngeal samples and assess the effect of inactivation methods on viral RNA copy number.
32467359,Viral inactivation was performed with three different methods: (1) incubation with TRIzol® LS Reagent for 10 min at room temperature, (2) heating in a waterbath at 56°C for 30 min, and (3) high-temperature treatment, including 121°C autoclaving for 20 min, 100°C boiling for 20 min, and 80°C heating for 20 min.
32467359,Compared to the amount of RNA in the original sample, TRIzol treatment destroyed 47.54% of N gene and 39.85% of ORF 1ab.
32467359,For samples treated at 56°C for 30 min, the copy number of N gene and ORF 1ab was reduced by 48.55% and 56.40%, respectively.
32467359,Viral RNA copy number dropped by 50-66% after 80°C heating for 20 min.
32467359,Nearly no viral RNA was detected after autoclaving at 121°C or boiling at 100°C for 20 min.
32467359,These results indicated that inactivation reduced the quantity of detectable viral RNA and may cause false negative results especially in weakly positive cases.
32467359,Thus, TRIzol is recommended for sample inactivation in comparison to heat inactivation as Trizol has the least effect on RNA copy number among the tested methods.
32467443,Recent studies have reported a high prevalence of thrombotic events in coronavirus disease 2019.
32467443,However, the significance of thromboembolic complications has not been widely appreciated.
32467443,The purpose of this review is to provide current knowledge of this serious problem.
32467443,Narrative review.
32467443,Online search of published medical literature through PubMed using the term &quot;COVID-19,&quot; &quot;SARS,&quot; &quot;acute respiratory distress syndrome,&quot; &quot;coronavirus,&quot; &quot;coagulopathy,&quot; &quot;thrombus,&quot; and &quot;anticoagulants.&quot; Articles were chosen for inclusion based on their relevance to coagulopathy and thrombosis in coronavirus disease 2019, and anticoagulant therapy.
32467443,Reference lists were reviewed to identify additional relevant articles.
32467443,Coronavirus disease 2019 is associated with a strikingly high prevalence of coagulopathy and venous thromboembolism that may contribute to respiratory deterioration.
32467443,Monitoring coagulation variables is important, as abnormal coagulation tests are related to adverse outcomes and may necessitate adjuvant antithrombotic interventions.
32467443,In the initial phase of the infection, D-dimer and fibrinogen levels are increased, while activated partial prothrombin time, prothrombin time, and platelet counts are often relatively normal.
32467443,Increased D-dimer levels three times the upper limit of normal may trigger screening for venous thromboembolism.
32467443,In all hospitalized patients, thromboprophylaxis using low-molecular-weight heparin is currently recommended.
32467443,The etiology of the procoagulant responses is complex and thought to be a result of specific interactions between host defense mechanisms and the coagulation system.
32467443,Although the coagulopathy is reminiscent of disseminated intravascular coagulation and thrombotic microangiopathy, it has features that are markedly distinct from these entities.
32467443,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2/coronavirus disease 2019 frequently induces hypercoagulability with both microangiopathy and local thrombus formation, and a systemic coagulation defect that leads to large vessel thrombosis and major thromboembolic complications, including pulmonary embolism in critically ill hospitalized patients.
32467443,D-dimers and fibrinogen levels should be monitored, and all hospitalized patients should undergo thromboembolism prophylaxis with an increase in therapeutic anticoagulation in certain clinical situations.
32467809,Appendectomy is the gold standard of treatment for acute appendicitis; however, recent evidence suggests conservative management with intravenous antibiotics may provide similar outcomes and can be used as an alternative in selected patients.
32467809,Performing appendectomy in acute appendicitis patients with 2019 novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) is challenging, as it involves considerable operative risks for the patients and risks for health care professionals (HCPs) exposed to COVID-19.
32467809,Medical management eliminates the morbidity and mortality associated with surgery but involves significant risks of treatment failures that, in turn, may lead to perforation, peritonitis, and death.
32467809,We are reporting a case of a middle-aged man with multiple co-morbidities, who was diagnosed with COVID-19 and acute appendicitis.
32467809,Our patient received intravenous antibiotics for seven days with a significant improvement in symptoms.
32467809,Our case report illustrates the implementation of successful conservative treatment for acute appendicitis in COVID-19 patients.
32467810,The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become the most talked-about clinical entity in early 2020.
32467810,As an infection that spreads easily and has a significant mortality rate, it has caused global panic rarely seen before.
32467810,Many of the measures taken by governments worldwide will have long-lasting impacts on the wellbeing of the population at large.
32467810,It has been widely reported that the most vulnerable patients have been most negatively affected by SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19).
32467810,In this study, we have tried to search the currently available data on the outcomes of infected cancer patients.
32467810,Most of the data points to the very challenging nature of treating such patients.
32467810,Their overall outcomes seem to be worse than in the general population, and it may be difficult to differentiate which potential complications are a result of the primary oncologic disease versus the infection.
32467810,Management presents its own set of challenges, including but not limited to, deciding whether postponing cancer treatment until the infection resolves is going to benefit the patient and how to organize all aspects of patient care when social contact is as limited as it is for patients newly diagnosed with COVID-19.
32467810,We believe that as more data becomes available, it is going to be necessary to publish detailed guidelines on how to approach this unique clinical challenge.
32468014,The major impact produced by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) focused many researchers attention to find treatments that can suppress transmission or ameliorate the disease.
32468014,Despite the very fast and large flow of scientific data on possible treatment solutions, none have yet demonstrated unequivocal clinical utility against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19).
32468014,This work represents an exhaustive and critical review of all available data on potential treatments for COVID‑19, highlighting their mechanistic characteristics and the strategy development rationale.
32468014,Drug repurposing, also known as drug repositioning, and target based methods are the most used strategies to advance therapeutic solutions into clinical practice.
32468014,Current in silico, in vitro and in vivo evidence regarding proposed treatments are summarized providing strong support for future research efforts.
32468196,There is a need to identify effective, safe treatments for COVID-19 (coronavirus disease) rapidly, given the current, ongoing pandemic.
32468196,A systematic benefit-risk assessment was designed and conducted to examine the benefit-risk profile of remdesivir in COVID-19 patients compared with standard of care, placebo or other treatments.
32468196,A key objective of this study was to provide a platform for a dynamic systematic benefit-risk evaluation, which starts with inevitably limited information (to meet the urgent unmet public health need worldwide), then update the benefit-risk evaluation as more data become available.
32468196,The Benefit-Risk Action Team (BRAT) framework was used to assess the overall benefit-risk of the use of remdesivir as a treatment for COVID-19 compared with standard of care, placebo or other treatments.
32468196,We searched PubMed, Google Scholar and government agency websites to identify literature reporting clinical outcomes in patients taking remdesivir for COVID-19.
32468196,A value tree was constructed and key benefits and risks were ranked by two clinicians in order of considered importance.
32468196,Using the BRAT method, several key benefits and risks for use of remdesivir in COVID-19 compared with placebo have been identified.
32468196,In one trial, the benefit of time to clinical improvement was not statistically significant (21 vs 23 days, HR 1.23, 95% CI 0.87-1.75), although the study was underpowered.
32468196,In another trial, a shorter time to recovery in patients treated with remdesivir was observed (11 vs 15 days), with non-significant reduced mortality risk (8% vs 12%).
32468196,Risk data were only available from one trial.
32468196,This trial reported fewer serious adverse events in patients taking remdesivir (18%) compared with the placebo group (26%); however, more patients in the remdesivir group discontinued treatment as a result of an adverse event compared with those patients receiving placebo (12% vs 5%).
32468196,Preliminary clinical trial results suggest that there may be a favourable benefit-risk profile for remdesivir compared with placebo in severe COVID-19 infection and further data on benefits would strengthen this evaluation.
32468196,There is limited safety data for remdesivir, which should be obtained in further studies.
32468196,The current framework summarises the key anticipated benefits and risks for which further data are needed.
32468196,Ongoing clinical trial data can be incorporated into the framework when available to provide an updated benefit-risk assessment.
32468425,The world is currently experiencing the Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic.
32468425,There is no approved drug for the definitive treatment of the disease.
32468425,Various drugs are being tried for the treatment of COVID-19, including hydroxychloroquine (HCQ).
32468425,This study was performed to systematically review the therapeutic role of HCQ in COVID-19 from the available literature.
32468425,PubMed, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, ICTRP (WHO), Cochrane Library databases, and two pre-print servers (medRxiv.org and Research Square) were searched for clinical studies that evaluated the therapeutic role of HCQ on COVID-19 until 10 May 2020.
32468425,The available studies were critically analyzed and the data were extracted.
32468425,A total of 663 articles were screened and 12 clinical studies (seven peer-reviewed and published studies and five non-peer-reviewed studies from pre-print servers) with a total sample size of 3543 patients were included.
32468425,Some of the clinical studies demonstrated good virological and clinical outcomes with HCQ alone or in combination with azithromycin in COVID-19 patients, although the studies had major methodological limitations.
32468425,Some of the other studies showed negative results with HCQ therapy along with the risk of adverse reactions.
32468425,The results of efficacy and safety of HCQ in COVID-19, as obtained from the clinical studies, are not satisfactory, although many of these studies had major methodological limitations.
32468425,Stronger evidence from well-designed robust randomized clinical trials is required before conclusively determining the role of HCQ in the treatment of COVID-19.
32468425,Clinical prudence is required in advocating HCQ as a therapeutic armamentarium in COVID-19.
32468851,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spread represents a sanitary emergency all over the world.
32468851,Viral biology is only partially known with some aspects in common with other CoV and the damage observed in most severe cases is due to intense inflammation.
32468851,Immunotherapy restores immunological activity against cancer cells and it has become a standard treatment for several cancers.
32468851,We carried out an examination of available data concerning with the effects exerted by both SARS-CoV-2 and the most widespread immunotherapy treatments on the immune system in order to hypothesize mechanisms underlying potential and mutual interaction.
32468851,We provided an analysis of laboratory, clinical and therapeutic data related with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus.
32468851,We finally focused on implications of immunotherapy treatments in clinical practice.
32469045,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has presented novel challenges to healthcare systems; however, an analysis of the impact of the pandemic on inpatient pharmacy services has not yet been conducted.
32469045,Results of an observational assessment of operational and clinical pharmacy services at a community teaching hospital during the first weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic are presented.
32469045,Service outcomes of the inpatient pharmacy were evaluated from February 1 to April 8, 2020.
32469045,Outcomes during the weeks preceding the first COVID-19 admission (February 1 to March 11, 2020) and during the pandemic period (March 12 to April 8, 2020) were compared.
32469045,Evaluated outcomes included daily order verifications, clinical interventions, and usage of relevant medications.
32469045,An exploratory statistical analysis was conducted using Student's t test.
32469045,During the pandemic period, the number of new order verifications decreased from approximately 5,000 orders per day to 3,300 orders per day (P &lt; 0.01), a reduction of 30% during the first 4 weeks of the pandemic compared to the weeks prior.
32469045,Average daily pharmacokinetic dosing consults were reduced in the pandemic period (from 82 to 67; P &lt; 0.01) compared to the prepandemic period; however, total daily pharmacist interventions did not differ significantly (473 vs 456; P = 0.68).
32469045,Dispensing of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, enoxaparin, and sedative medications increased substantially during the pandemic period (P &lt; 0.01 for all comparisons).
32469045,The operational and clinical requirements of an inpatient pharmacy department shifted considerably during the first weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic.
32469045,Pharmacy departments must be adaptable in order to continue to provide effective pharmaceutical care during the pandemic.
32469074,A variety of trials are in development and underway to examine potential interventions for the treatment and prophylaxis of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32469074,How should we think about offering payment to participants in these trials?
32469074,Payment for research participation is ethically contentious even under ideal circumstances, and pandemics are far from ideal.
32469074,Here, we review the three functions of research payment-reimbursement, compensation, and incentive-and identify heightened and novel ethical concerns in the context of a global pandemic.
32469074,We argue that COVID-19 trial participants should usually be offered reimbursement for research-related expenses, as well as compensation for their time and effort, as is true for other types of research under usual circumstances.
32469074,Given increased risk of undue influence against pandemic background conditions, incentive payment should be avoided unless essential to recruitment and retention in important trials whose social value outweighs this risk.
32469074,Where essential, however, incentives can be ethically permissible, so long as reasonable efforts are made to minimize the possibility of undue influence.
32469189,In the midst of the SARS-CoV 2 pandemic basic healthcare challenges arise as lockdowns and social isolation are implemented to prevent the spread of the virus.
32469189,In order to overcome these challenges, the Polish the National Health Fund has facilitated telemedical consultations.
32469189,The aim of this study was to compare teleconsultations to regular ambulatory clinic of implantable devices (ACIM) visits and to assess whether teleconsultations would be an adequate replacement during a time when face-to-face contact should be limited.
32469189,Teleconsultations in the ACIM were introduced for patients without the possibility of remote control cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIED).
32469189,Prior to planned visits physicians made phone calls and interviewed the patient about their health.
32469189,Further treatment decisions were made based on the interview and available documentation.
32469189,Teleconsultations were performed during a 3.5-week period (13.03.2020 to 01.04.2020).
32469189,Of the 400 patients planned for visits in the ACIM, 349 were consulted by phone. 299 patients confirmed stable health. 14/349 patients reported some symptoms and 4/349 patients were hospitalized; 2/349 patients changed their primary ACIM and were no longer under our care, 1/349 patient was undergoing quarantine, 15/349 patients required additional intervention and 15 patients had died prior to contact.
32469189,In general patients gave positive feedback on their teleconsultations.
32469189,Teleconsultations are a much-needed solution during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32469189,They are an effective way to decrease interpersonal contact and to overcome sudden changes to the visitation scheme which may otherwise have put an overwhelming burden on the ACIM.
32469387,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in December 2019, causing human coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has now spread into a worldwide pandemic.
32469387,The pulmonary manifestations of COVID-19 have been well described in the literature.
32469387,Two similar human coronaviruses that cause Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-1) are known to cause disease in the central and peripheral nervous systems.
32469387,Emerging evidence suggests COVID-19 has neurologic consequences as well.
32469387,This review serves to summarize available information regarding coronaviruses in the nervous system, identify the potential tissue targets and routes of entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the central nervous system, and describe the range of clinical neurological complications that have been reported thus far in COVID-19 and their potential pathogenesis.
32469387,Viral neuroinvasion may be achieved by several routes, including transsynaptic transfer across infected neurons, entry via the olfactory nerve, infection of vascular endothelium, or leukocyte migration across the blood-brain barrier.
32469387,The most common neurologic complaints in COVID-19 are anosmia, ageusia, and headache, but other diseases, such as stroke, impairment of consciousness, seizure, and encephalopathy, have also been reported.
32469387,Recognition and understanding of the range of neurological disorders associated with COVID-19 may lead to improved clinical outcomes and better treatment algorithms.
32469387,Further neuropathological studies will be crucial to understanding the pathogenesis of the disease in the central nervous system, and longitudinal neurologic and cognitive assessment of individuals after recovery from COVID-19 will be crucial to understand the natural history of COVID-19 in the central nervous system and monitor for any long-term neurologic sequelae.
32469614,The risk of COVID-19 among people living with HIV (PLWH) is largely unknown and there have been very few reported cases in the literature.
32469614,We report a case series of five PLWH with COVID-19.
32469614,We identified all patients with a diagnosis of HIV who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at University of Chicago Medicine between March 1, 2020, and April 7, 2020.
32469614,We retrospectively collected data regarding demographics, comorbidities, medications, laboratory test results, radiology results, and outcomes associated with COVID-19.
32469614,All five PLWH with COVID-19 were African American; 80% (4/5) were cisgender females.
32469614,The mean age of patients was 48 years old (range 38-53).
32469614,The majority of patients presented with cough, fever, and shortness of breath.
32469614,Three patients had diarrhea.
32469614,One patient presented with predominantly cardiac symptoms.
32469614,All were taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) with CD4 count &gt;200 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> and suppressed HIV viral loads at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis.
32469614,All five patients were hospitalized, two required supplemental oxygen, and none required mechanical ventilation.
32469614,Four patients were treated with azithromycin and a cephalosporin and two were also treated with hydroxychloroquine.
32469614,The median length of stay was 3 days (range 2-7).
32469614,All patients recovered.
32469614,More research is needed to understand the risks of COVID-19 among PLWH and the impact of ART on outcomes for patients with COVID-19.
32470046,Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has recently been identified as the causative agent for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32470046,The ability of this agent to be transmitted by blood transfusion has not been documented, although viral RNA has been detected in serum.
32470046,Exposure to treatment with riboflavin and ultraviolet light (R + UV) reduces blood-borne pathogens while maintaining blood product quality.
32470046,Here, we report on the efficacy of R + UV in reducing SARS-CoV-2 infectivity when tested in human plasma and whole blood products.
32470046,SARS-CoV-2 (isolate USA-WA1/2020) was used to inoculate plasma and whole blood units that then underwent treatment with riboflavin and UV light (Mirasol Pathogen Reduction Technology System, Terumo BCT, Lakewood, CO).
32470046,The infectious titers of SARS-CoV-2 in the samples before and after R + UV treatment were determined by plaque assay on Vero E6 cells.
32470046,Each plasma pool (n = 9) underwent R + UV treatment performed in triplicate using individual units of plasma and then repeated using individual whole blood donations (n = 3).
32470046,Riboflavin and UV light reduced the infectious titer of SARS-CoV-2 below the limit of detection for plasma products at 60-100% of the recommended energy dose.
32470046,At the UV light dose recommended by the manufacturer, the mean log reductions in the viral titers were ≥ 4.79 ± 0.15 Logs in plasma and 3.30 ± 0.26 in whole blood units.
32470046,Riboflavin and UV light effectively reduced the titer of SARS-CoV-2 to the limit of detection in human plasma and by 3.30 ± 0.26 on average in whole blood.
32470046,Two clades of SARS-CoV-2 have been described and questions remain about whether exposure to one strain confers strong immunity to the other.
32470046,Pathogen-reduced blood products may be a safer option for critically ill patients with COVID-19, particularly those in high-risk categories.
32470151,The wide spectrum of symptoms observed in COVID-19 appears to defy explanation.
32470151,Apart from geographic limitation to people with prior exposure to other coronaviruses and air pollutants, inflammatory comordidities and older ages are also among the main factors of susceptibility to severe illness.
32470151,The unusual epidemiological data pointed out in children and African territories have revealed new insights in host-pathogen interplay with more focus on epigenetic regulation of cognitive compartments belonging to innate immunity.
32470151,Should trained immunity be proven to be involved in timely immune responsiveness against SARS-CoV-2 and that adaptive memory could be detrimental, both treatment regimens and vaccine design will tremendously change accordingly with more focus on upper respiratory tissue innate immunity to subdue this threat underway.

32470153,To investigate the inflammatory factors and lymphocyte subsets which play an important role in the course of severe COVID-19.
32470153,A total of 27 patients with severe COVID-19 who were admitted to Tongji Hospital in Wuhan from 1 to 21 February 2020 were recruited to the study.
32470153,The characteristics of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-2 receptor (IL-2R), IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, C-reactive protein (CRP), serum ferritin and procalcitonin (PCT), and lymphocyte subsets of these patients were retrospectively compared before and after treatment.
32470153,Before treatment, there was no significant difference in most inflammatory factors (IL-1β, IL-2R, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, CRP and serum ferritin) between male and female patients.
32470153,Levels of IL-2R, IL-6, TNF-α and CRP decreased significantly after treatment, followed by IL-8, IL-10 and PCT.
32470153,Serum Ferritin was increased in all patients before treatment, but did not decrease significantly after treatment.
32470153,IL-1β was normal in most patients before treatment.
32470153,Lymphopenia was common among these patients with severe COVID-19.
32470153,Analysis of lymphocyte subsets showed that CD4<sup>+</sup> and particularly CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes increased significantly after treatment.
32470153,However, B lymphocytes and natural killer cells showed no significant changes after treatment.
32470153,A pro-inflammatory response and decreased level of T lymphocytes were associated with severe COVID-19.

32470212,We read with interest the article by Lorenzo et al On Conjunctivitis and COVID-19: a meta analysis.
32470212,We appreciate the article's suggestions on protection in ophthalmic diagnosis and treatment, but believe that the data and conclusions in meta-analysis need further study.

32470486,Accumulating evidence proposed JAK inhibitors as therapeutic targets warranting rapid investigation.
32470486,This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of ruxolitinib, a Janus-associated kinase (JAK1/2) inhibitor, for COVID-19.
32470486,We conducted a prospective, multicenter, single-blind, randomized controlled phase II trial involving patients with severe COVID-19.
32470486,Forty-three patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive ruxolitinib plus SoC treatment (22 patients) or placebo based on SoC treatment (21 patients).
32470486,After exclusion of 2 patients (1 ineligible, 1 consent withdrawn) from the ruxolitinib group, 20 patients in intervention group and 21 patients in control group were included in the study.
32470486,Treatment with ruxolitinib plus SoC was not associated with significantly accelerated clinical improvement in severe patients with COVID-19, although ruxolitinib recipients had a numerically faster clinical improvement.
32470486,Eighteen (90%) patients from the ruxolitinib group showed CT improvement at D<sub>14</sub> compared with 13 (61.9%) patients from the control group (P = 0.0495).
32470486,Three patients in the control group died of respiratory failure, with 14.3% overall mortality at D<sub>28</sub>; no patients died in the ruxolitinib group.
32470486,Ruxolitinib was well tolerated with low toxicities and no new safety signals.
32470486,Levels of 7 cytokines were significantly decreased in the ruxolitinib group in comparison to the control group.
32470486,Although no statistical difference was observed, ruxolitinib recipients had a numerically faster clinical improvement.
32470486,Significant chest CT improvement, a faster recovery from lymphopenia and favorable side-effect profile in ruxolitinib group were encouraging and informative to future trials to test efficacy of ruxolitinib in a larger population.
32470486,This trial is registered at www.chictr.org.cn as ChiCTR-OPN-2000029580.
32470751,Novel Corona-virus Disease 2019 (nCOVID 19) is caused by a novel virulent corona virus and leads to potentially fatal virulent pneumonia and severe respiratory distress syndrome.
32470751,It was initially declared as public health emergency if international concern by WHO followed by Pandemic on 12th March 2020.
32470751,As of 10th April 2020, more than 1.5 million people are affected globally with around 95,000 deaths.
32470751,Vaccines for this deadly virus are currently under development and many drugs used for other indications have been repurposed and investigated for prophylaxis and treatment of COVID 19.
32470751,As per SOLIDARITY trial by WHO, some of the most promising candidates include chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine which are anti-malarial medications, Remdesivir, Lopinavir-Ritonavir combination with or without interferon which are anti-HIV drugs and convalescent plasma therapy.
32470751,The current evidence of efficacy and ongoing research has been elaborated in the article.
32470751,Besides, there has been evidence regarding inflammatory pathogenesis of this virus leading to cytokine storm in susceptible individuals.
32470751,Thus, anti-proinflammatory cytokine drugs like Anakinra and Tocilizumab are undergoing multiple trials and some results are encouraging.
32470751,Similarly, use of anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-37 and IL-38 is hypothesised to be useful and is under research.
32470751,The situation is still evolving and hence there is yet no definitive therapy but to conclude the use of repurposed medications can be a boon till a definitive therapy and vaccines are developed.
32470789,recent studies have provided novel evidence regarding the effect of nicotine agonists on the prevention or modulation of cytokines storm and reduction of infection.
32470789,In this study we tried to attempt to address these issues from a therapeutic perspective of nicotine agonists in this manner and we describe one of the most challenging theories of immunotherapy in coronavirus-19 (COVID-19).
32470789,The analysis of the proposed mechanism goes beyond the physiological consequences of a way to design new strategies to provide anti-inflammatory drugs.
32470888,To model the effects of continuous, intermittent, and stepping-down social distancing (SD) strategies and personal protection measures on COVID-19 transmission dynamics.
32470888,Constant, intermittent, and stepping-down SD strategies were modeled at 4 mean magnitudes (5%, 10 %, 15 % and 20 %), 2 time windows (40-days, 80-days), and 2 levels of personal caution (30 % and 50 %).
32470888,The stepping-down strategy was the best long-term SD strategy to minimize the peak number of active COVID-19 cases and associated deaths.
32470888,The stepping-down strategy also resulted in a reduction in total time required to SD over a two-year period by 6.5 % compared to an intermittent or constant SD strategy.
32470888,An 80-day SD time-window was statistically more effective in maintaining control over the COVID-19 pandemic than a 40-day window.
32470888,However, the results were dependent upon 50 % of people being cautious (engaging in personal protection measures).
32470888,If people exercise caution while in public by protecting themselves (e.g., wearing a facemask, proper hand hygiene and avoid agglomeration) the magnitude and duration of SD necessary to maintain control over the pandemic can be reduced.
32470888,Our models suggest that the most effective way to reduce SD over a two-year period is a stepping-down approach every 80 days.
32470888,According to our model, this method would prevent a second peak and the number of intensive care units needed per day would be within the threshold of those currently available.
32470889,Novel coronavirus has wrecked medical and health care facilities claiming ∼5% death tollsglobally.
32470889,All efforts to contain the pathogenesis either using inhibitory drugs or vaccines largelyremained futile due to a lack of better understanding of the genomic feature of this virus.
32470889,In thepresent study, we compared the 2019-nCoV with other coronaviruses, which indicated that batSARS like coronavirus could be a probable ancestor of the novel coronavirus.
32470889,The proteinsequence similarity of pangolin-hCoV and bat-hCoV with human coronavirus was higher ascompared to their nucleotide similarity denoting the occurrence of more synonymous mutationsin the genome.
32470889,Phylogenetic and alignment analysis of 591 novel coronaviruses of differentclades from Group I to Group V revealed several mutations and concomitant amino acidchanges.
32470889,Detailed investigation on nucleotide substitution unfolded 100 substitutions in thecoding region of which 43 were synonymous and 57 were of non-synonymous type.
32470889,The nonsynonymous substitutions resulting into 57 amino acid changes were found to be distributed overdifferent hCoV proteins with maximum on spike protein.
32470889,An important di-amino acid change RGto KR was observed in ORF9 protein.
32470889,Additionally, several interesting features of the novelcoronavirus genome have been highlighted in respect to various other human infecting viruseswhich may explain extreme pathogenicity, infectivity and simultaneously the reason behindfailure of the antiviral therapies.
32470889,SUMMARY: This study presents a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV2 isolates to understand discrete mutations that are occurring between patient samples.
32470889,The analysis unravel various amino acid mutations in the viral proteins which may provide an explanation for varying treatment efficacies of different inhibitory drugs and a future direction towards a combinatorial treatment therapies based on the kind of mutation in the viral genome.
32470948,The severity and outcome of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) largely depends on a patient's age.
32470948,Adults over 65 years of age represent 80% of hospitalizations and have a 23-fold greater risk of death than those 65.
32470948,In the clinic, COVID-19 patients most commonly present with fever, cough and dyspnea, and from there the disease can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome, lung consolidation, cytokine release syndrome, endotheliitis, coagulopathy, multiple organ failure and death.
32470948,Comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and obesity increase the chances of fatal disease, but they alone do not explain why age is an independent risk factor.
32470948,Here, we present the molecular differences between young, middle-aged and older people that may explain why COVID-19 is a mild illness in some but life-threatening in others.
32470948,We also discuss several biological age clocks that could be used in conjunction with genetic tests to identify both the mechanisms of the disease and individuals most at risk.
32470948,Finally, based on these mechanisms, we discuss treatments that could increase the survival of older people, not simply by inhibiting the virus, but by restoring patients' ability to clear the infection and effectively regulate immune responses.
32471001,The SARS-Cov-2 infection disease (COVID-19) pandemic has posed at risk the kidney transplant (KT) population, particularly the elderly recipients.
32471001,From March-12<sup>th</sup> until April-4<sup>th</sup> 2020, we diagnosed COVID-19 in 16 of our 324 KT patients aged ≥65 years old (4.9%).
32471001,Many of them had had contact with healthcare facilities in the month prior to infection.
32471001,Median time of symptom onset to admission was 7 days.
32471001,All presented with fever and all but one with pneumonia.
32471001,Up to 33% showed renal graft dysfunction.
32471001,At infection diagnosis, mTOR inhibitors or mycophenolate were withdrawn.
32471001,Tacrolimus was withdrawn in 70%.
32471001,The main treatment combination was hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin.
32471001,A subset of patients was treated with anti-retroviral and tocilizumab.
32471001,Short-term fatality rate was 50% at a median time since admission of 3 days.
32471001,Those who died were more frequently obese, frail and had underlying heart disease.
32471001,Although a higher respiratory rate was observed at admission in nonsurvivors, symptoms at presentation were similar between both groups.
32471001,Patients who died were more anemic, lymphopenic and showed higher D-dimer, C-reactive protein, and IL-6 at their first tests.
32471001,COVID-19 is frequent among the elderly KT population and associates a very early and high mortality rate.
32471115,The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is a network of proteins regulating many aspects of human physiology, including cardiovascular, pulmonary, and immune system physiology.
32471115,The RAS is a complicated network of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) (i.e., AT1R, AT2R, MASR, and MRGD) orchestrating the effects of several hormones (i.e., angiotensin II, angiotensin (1-7), and alamandine) produced by protease-based transmembrane receptors (ACE1 and ACE2).
32471115,Two signaling axes have been identified in the RAS endocrine system that mediate the proliferative actions of angiotensin II (i.e., the AT1R-based pathway) or the anti-proliferative effects of RAS hormones (i.e., the AT2R-, MAS-, and MRGD-based pathways).
32471115,Disruption of the balance between these two axes can cause different diseases (e.g., cardiovascular pathologies and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2- (SARS-CoV-2)-based COVID-19 disease).
32471115,It is now accepted that all the components of the RAS endocrine system are expressed in cancer, including cancer of the breast.
32471115,Breast cancer (BC) is a multifactorial pathology for which there is a continuous need to identify novel drugs.
32471115,Here, I reviewed the possible roles of both axes of the RAS endocrine network as potential druggable pathways in BC.
32471115,Remarkably, the analysis of the current knowledge of the different GPCRs of the RAS molecular system not only confirms that AT1R could be considered a drug target and that its inhibition by losartan and candesartan could be useful in the treatment of BC, but also identifies Mas-related GPCR member D (MRGD) as a druggable protein.
32471115,Overall, the RAS of GPCRs offers multifaceted opportunities for the development of additional compounds for the treatment of BC.
32471171,Excess ascorbate (as expected in intravenous treatment proposed for COVID-19 management, for example) oxidizes and/or degrades hemoglobin and albumin, as evidenced by UV-vis spectroscopy, gel electrophoresis, and mass spectrometry.
32471171,It also degrades hemoglobin in intact blood or in isolated erythrocytes.
32471171,The survival rates and metabolic activities of several leukocyte subsets implicated in the antiviral cellular immune response are also affected.
32471171,Excess ascorbate is thus an unselective biological stress agent.
32471203,Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and its subsequent global spread, Taiwan has been combatting this pandemic.
32471203,COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32471203,As SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted through droplets and aerosols, we cannot ignore the risk of transmission during hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT).
32471203,Our hyperbaric oxygen therapy center prioritizes preventing the spread of COVID-19 and maintaining operation for the patients during the pandemic.
32471203,The aim of this article is to share the protocol that we have adopted in our hyperbaric oxygen therapy center to help prevent the spread of COVID-19.
32471205,Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in December 2019 and its rapid spread worldwide, the scientific community has been under pressure to react and make progress in the development of an effective treatment against the virus responsible for the disease.
32471205,Here, we implement an original virtual screening (VS) protocol for repositioning approved drugs in order to predict which of them could inhibit the main protease of the virus (M-pro), a key target for antiviral drugs given its essential role in the virus' replication.
32471205,Two different libraries of approved drugs were docked against the structure of M-pro using Glide, FRED and AutoDock Vina, and only the equivalent high affinity binding modes predicted simultaneously by the three docking programs were considered to correspond to bioactive poses.
32471205,In this way, we took advantage of the three sampling algorithms to generate hypothetic binding modes without relying on a single scoring function to rank the results.
32471205,Seven possible SARS-CoV-2 M-pro inhibitors were predicted using this approach: Perampanel, Carprofen, Celecoxib, Alprazolam, Trovafloxacin, Sarafloxacin and ethyl biscoumacetate.
32471205,Carprofen and Celecoxib have been selected by the COVID Moonshot initiative for in vitro testing; they show 3.97 and 11.90% M-pro inhibition at 50 µM, respectively.
32471274,The COVID-19 pandemic has caused unforeseen and extreme changes in societal and health system functioning not previously experienced in most countries in a lifetime.
32471274,The impact of the pandemic on clinical trials can be especially profound given their complexities and operational requirements.
32471274,The STREAM Clinical Trial is the largest trial for MDR-TB ever conducted.
32471274,Currently operating in seven countries, the trial had 126 participants on treatment and 312 additional participants in active follow up as of March 31, 2020.
32471274,Areas of particular concern during this global emergency include treatment continuity, supply chain management and participant safety monitoring.
32471274,This commentary highlights some of the challenges faced due to the pandemic and the steps taken to protect the safety of trial participants and the integrity of the trial.
32471278,At present, there is no vaccine or effective standard treatment for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (or coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19)), which frequently leads to lethal pulmonary inflammatory responses.
32471278,COVID-19 pathology is characterized by extreme inflammation and amplified immune response with activation of a cytokine storm.
32471278,A subsequent progression to acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) can take place, which is often followed by death.
32471278,The causes of these strong inflammatory responses in SARS-CoV-2 infection are still unknown.
32471278,As uncontrolled pulmonary inflammation is likely the main cause of death in SARS-CoV-2 infection, anti-inflammatory therapeutic interventions are particularly important.
32471278,Fenretinide N-(4-hydroxyphenyl) retinamide is a bioactive molecule characterized by poly-pharmacological properties and a low toxicity profile.
32471278,Fenretinide is endowed with antitumor, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and immunomodulating properties other than efficacy in obesity/diabetic pathologies.
32471278,Its anti-inflammatory and antiviral activities, in particular, could likely have utility in multimodal therapies for the treatment of ALI/ARDS in COVID-19 patients.
32471278,Moreover, fenretinide administration by pulmonary delivery systems could further increase its therapeutic value by carrying high drug concentrations to the lungs and triggering a rapid onset of activity.
32471278,This is particularly important in SARS-CoV-2 infection, where only a narrow time window exists for therapeutic intervention.
32471295,Reducing personal contacts is a central measure against the spreading of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
32471295,This troubles mental health, but also mental health care as treatments usually take place in personal contact and switching to remote treatments might be necessary in times of COVID-19.
32471295,The present study investigated the question how the provision of psychotherapy changed in the early weeks of the COVID-19 lockdown in Austria and whether there were differences between the four therapeutic orientations eligible in Austria (psychodynamic, humanistic, systemic, behavioral).
32471295,Psychotherapists (<i>N</i> = 1547) completed an online survey.
32471295,They entered their number of patients treated on average per week (in personal contact, via telephone, via Internet) in the early weeks of the COVID-19 lockdown in Austria as well as (retrospectively) in the months before.
32471295,The number of patients treated on average per week in personal contact decreased (on average 81%; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), whereas the number of patients treated on average per week via telephone and via Internet increased (on average 979% and 1561%; both <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001).
32471295,Yet, the decrease of psychotherapies through personal contact was not compensated for by increases of remote psychotherapies (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001).
32471295,No differences between the four therapeutic orientations emerged.
32471295,Results imply an undersupply of psychotherapy in the COVID-19 lockdown and that further changes are necessary to cover the increased need for timely psychotherapy in times of COVID-19.
32471794,Here, we describe two mild SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia cases.
32471794,One was imported from Wuhan, and the other was locally transmitted in Japan without recent travel to China.
32471794,In both cases, lower respiratory tract symptoms were observed first, and high fever progressed in about one week.
32471794,The laboratory findings revealed normal WBC and CRP despite apparent lung infiltrations, and typical observations on CT imaging were important diagnostic clues.
32471794,In the domestic endemic situation, a comprehensive evaluation of the clinical course, and laboratory and radiological findings was required for diagnosis.
32471812,In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, many healthcare systems are experiencing an increased demand for palliative care (PC).
32471812,To meet this challenge, the PC team at Cleveland Clinic designed an enterprise-wide response plan organized around 4 domains: <i>staff</i> (educational resources and tools), <i>stuff</i> (medications and supplies), <i>space</i> (recommendations for optimizing physical space and facilities), and <i>systems</i> to facilitate high-quality PC delivery to patients.
32471812,To mitigate isolation during end-of-life care, the Clinic offers &quot;compassionate exceptions&quot; to strict visitation policies, provides personal protective equipment to visitors of these patients, and facilitates virtual visitation via electronic devices.
32471876,Findings from CCC19 and TERAVOLT suggest that patients with cancer may be more likely to die from COVID-19 than people in the general population.
32471876,Additional mortality risk factors may include age, performance status, treatment with chemotherapy, and exposure to hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin.
32471884,To characterize patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) in a large New York City medical center and describe their clinical course across the emergency department, hospital wards, and intensive care units.
32471884,Retrospective manual medical record review.
32471884,NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center, a quaternary care academic medical center in New York City.
32471884,The first 1000 consecutive patients with a positive result on the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) who presented to the emergency department or were admitted to hospital between 1 March and 5 April 2020.
32471884,Patient data were manually abstracted from electronic medical records.
32471884,Characterization of patients, including demographics, presenting symptoms, comorbidities on presentation, hospital course, time to intubation, complications, mortality, and disposition.
32471884,Of the first 1000 patients, 150 presented to the emergency department, 614 were admitted to hospital (not intensive care units), and 236 were admitted or transferred to intensive care units.
32471884,The most common presenting symptoms were cough (732/1000), fever (728/1000), and dyspnea (631/1000).
32471884,Patients in hospital, particularly those treated in intensive care units, often had baseline comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes, and obesity.
32471884,Patients admitted to intensive care units were older, predominantly male (158/236, 66.9%), and had long lengths of stay (median 23 days, interquartile range 12-32 days); 78.0% (184/236) developed acute kidney injury and 35.2% (83/236) needed dialysis.
32471884,Only 4.4% (6/136) of patients who required mechanical ventilation were first intubated more than 14 days after symptom onset.
32471884,Time to intubation from symptom onset had a bimodal distribution, with modes at three to four days, and at nine days.
32471884,As of 30 April, 90 patients remained in hospital and 211 had died in hospital.
32471884,Patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 at this medical center faced major morbidity and mortality, with high rates of acute kidney injury and inpatient dialysis, prolonged intubations, and a bimodal distribution of time to intubation from symptom onset.
32471903,COVID-19 outcomes in people with rheumatic diseases remain poorly understood.
32471903,The aim was to examine demographic and clinical factors associated with COVID-19 hospitalisation status in people with rheumatic disease.
32471903,Case series of individuals with rheumatic disease and COVID-19 from the COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance registry: 24 March 2020 to 20 April 2020.
32471903,Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate ORs and 95% CIs of hospitalisation.
32471903,Age, sex, smoking status, rheumatic disease diagnosis, comorbidities and rheumatic disease medications taken immediately prior to infection were analysed.
32471903,A total of 600 cases from 40 countries were included.
32471903,Nearly half of the cases were hospitalised (277, 46%) and 55 (9%) died.
32471903,In multivariable-adjusted models, prednisone dose ≥10 mg/day was associated with higher odds of hospitalisation (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.06 to 3.96).
32471903,Use of conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) alone or in combination with biologics/Janus Kinase inhibitors was not associated with hospitalisation (OR 1.23, 95% CI 0.70 to 2.17 and OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.46, respectively).
32471903,Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use was not associated with hospitalisation status (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.06).
32471903,Tumour necrosis factor inhibitor (anti-TNF) use was associated with a reduced odds of hospitalisation (OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.81), while no association with antimalarial use (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.57) was observed.
32471903,We found that glucocorticoid exposure of ≥10 mg/day is associated with a higher odds of hospitalisation and anti-TNF with a decreased odds of hospitalisation in patients with rheumatic disease.
32471903,Neither exposure to DMARDs nor NSAIDs were associated with increased odds of hospitalisation.
32472138,We describe the characteristics of 31 people living with HIV (PLWH) hospitalized for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.
32472138,All patients were on antiretroviral therapy and virologically suppressed at the time of admission.
32472138,Clinical course and outcomes were similar to those reported in other hospitalized cohorts.
32472191,Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a life-threatening infection caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus.
32472191,Diabetes has rapidly emerged as a major comorbidity for COVID-19 severity.
32472191,However, the phenotypic characteristics of diabetes in COVID-19 patients are unknown.
32472191,We conducted a nationwide multicentre observational study in people with diabetes hospitalised for COVID-19 in 53 French centres in the period 10-31 March 2020.
32472191,The primary outcome combined tracheal intubation for mechanical ventilation and/or death within 7 days of admission.
32472191,Age- and sex-adjusted multivariable logistic regressions were performed to assess the prognostic value of clinical and biological features with the endpoint.
32472191,ORs are reported for a 1 SD increase after standardisation.
32472191,The current analysis focused on 1317 participants: 64.9% men, mean age 69.8 ± 13.0 years, median BMI 28.4 (25th-75th percentile: 25.0-32.7) kg/m<sup>2</sup>; with a predominance of type 2 diabetes (88.5%).
32472191,Microvascular and macrovascular diabetic complications were found in 46.8% and 40.8% of cases, respectively.
32472191,The primary outcome was encountered in 29.0% (95% CI 26.6, 31.5) of participants, while 10.6% (9.0, 12.4) died and 18.0% (16.0, 20.2) were discharged on day 7.
32472191,In univariate analysis, characteristics prior to admission significantly associated with the primary outcome were sex, BMI and previous treatment with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockers, but not age, type of diabetes, HbA<sub>1c</sub>, diabetic complications or glucose-lowering therapies.
32472191,In multivariable analyses with covariates prior to admission, only BMI remained positively associated with the primary outcome (OR 1.28 [1.10, 1.47]).
32472191,On admission, dyspnoea (OR 2.10 [1.31, 3.35]), as well as lymphocyte count (OR 0.67 [0.50, 0.88]), C-reactive protein (OR 1.93 [1.43, 2.59]) and AST (OR 2.23 [1.70, 2.93]) levels were independent predictors of the primary outcome.
32472191,Finally, age (OR 2.48 [1.74, 3.53]), treated obstructive sleep apnoea (OR 2.80 [1.46, 5.38]), and microvascular (OR 2.14 [1.16, 3.94]) and macrovascular complications (OR 2.54 [1.44, 4.50]) were independently associated with the risk of death on day 7.
32472191,In people with diabetes hospitalised for COVID-19, BMI, but not long-term glucose control, was positively and independently associated with tracheal intubation and/or death within 7 days. clinicaltrials.gov NCT04324736.
32472216,Currently world is fighting with global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32472216,At this time of uncertainty, oncologists are struggling to provide appropriate care to cancer patients.
32472216,They have to weigh risk and benefit of giving cancer treatment vs chances of getting them infected with COVID-19.
32472216,As cancer patients are immunocompromised and there are high chances of exposure during hospital visits and if they get infected, outcome can be fatal.
32472216,So through the column of this article, we would like to provide basic guideline in management of cancer patients during COVID-19 pandemic.
32472231,The continuing outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has inflicted considerable burdens onto the health system of China, the world's most populous country.
32472231,Remarkably, among spectrum of potential mitigation strategies, the Chinese government has implemented all-out lockdowns on large geographical areas, unprecedented in the modern era.
32472231,This inevitably undermined the right to healthcare of many who now faced great difficulty in getting treatment, especially those with cancer or other life-threatening issues.
32472231,We elaborate and discuss the medico-legal and human rights consideration triggered by the lockdowns, the unprecedented mass quarantine of Hubei province in China, and the suspension of normal healthcare services.
32472231,We argue that the same challenge will now be faced by other countries, particularly the USA, Italy, Spain, and France, as the epicentres of COVID-19 has shifted to Europe and the Americas.
32472454,The COVID-19 pandemic has forced healthcare stakeholders towards challenging decisions.
32472454,We analyse the impact of the pandemic on the conduct of phase I-II trials for paediatric cancer during the first month of state of alarm in Spain.
32472454,A questionnaire was sent to all five ITCC-accredited Spanish Paediatric Oncology Early Phase Clinical Trial Units, including questions about impact on staff activities, recruitment, patient care, supply of investigational products, and legal aspects.
32472454,All units suffered personnel shortages and difficulties in enrolling patients, treatment continuity, or performing trial assessments.
32472454,Monitoring activity was frequently postponed (73%), and 49% of on-going trials interrupted recruitment.
32472454,Only two patients could be recruited during this period (75% reduction in the expected rate).
32472454,The COVID-19 crisis has significantly impacted clinical research practice and access to innovation for children with cancer.
32472454,Structural and functional changes are under way to better cope with the expected future restrictions.
32472459,The novel coronavirus (Sars-CoV-2) pandemic has spread rapidly, from December to the end of March, to 185 countries, and there have been over 3,000,000 cases identified and over 200,000 deaths.
32472459,For a proportion of hospitalized patients, death can occur within a few days, mainly for adult respiratory distress syndrome or multi-organ dysfunction syndrome.
32472459,In these patients, clinical signs and symptoms, as well as laboratory abnormalities, suggest a cytokine storm syndrome in response to the viral infection.
32472459,No current targeted treatment is yet available for COVID-19, an unknown disease up to 2 months ago, which challenges doctors and researchers to find new drugs or reallocate other treatments for these patients.
32472459,Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, a growing body of information on diagnostic and therapeutic strategies has emerged, mainly based on preliminary experience on retrospective studies or small case series.
32472459,Antivirals, antimalarials, corticosteroids, biotechnological and small molecules, convalescent plasma and anticoagulants are among the drugs proposed for the treatment or in tested for COVID-19.
32472459,Given the complexity of this new condition, a multidisciplinary management seems to be the best approach.
32472459,Sharing and integrating knowledge between specialists, to evaluate the correct timing and setting of every treatment, could greatly benefit our patients.
32472459,We reviewed the literature, combining it with our experiences and our specialist knowledge, to propose a management algorithm, correlating the clinical features with laboratory and imaging findings to establish the right timing for each treatment.Key Points• Critically ill COVID-19 patients show signs of cytokine storm syndrome.
32472459,• No current targeted therapy is available, but a lot of drugs are in tested.
32472459,• A multidisciplinary approach is crucial to manage COVID-19.
32472459,• Choosing the correct timing of treatment is of pivotal importance to avoid the most severe complications.
32472461,Since December 2019, the pandemic caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) raises a real public health problem.
32472461,COVID-19 appeared in Wuhan (Hubei province) in China.
32472461,Drugs that have been used in rheumatology for decades seem to be effective in this infection and are for the most part being studied.
32472461,The rational use of these anti-rheumatic drugs is based on the cytokinic storm (hyperproduction of IL1, IL6, TNF α) in the body by COVID-19 in its severe form.
32472461,In this review, the authors make the difference between the infectious and auto-inflammatory part of COVID-19; the disease does not seem to be a risk factor for admission to the intensive care unit for patients suffering from inflammatory rheumatism; however, the poverty of studies on this subject should be noted.
32472461,The authors also review anti-rheumatic drugs while studying COVID-19 treatment.
32472464,Acute IH is a common surgical presentation.
32472464,Despite new guidelines being published recently, a number of important questions remained unanswered including the role of taxis, as initial non-operative management.
32472464,This is particularly relevant now due to the possibility of a lack of immediate surgical care as a result of COVID-19.
32472464,The aim of this review is to assess the role of taxis in the management of emergency inguinal hernias.
32472464,A review of the literature was undertaken.
32472464,Available literature published until March 2019 was obtained and reviewed. 32,021 papers were identified, only 9 were of sufficient value to be used.
32472464,There was a large discrepancy in the terminology of incarcerated/strangulated used.
32472464,Taxis can be safely attempted early after the onset of symptoms and is effective in about 70% of patients.
32472464,The possibility of reduction en-mass should be kept in mind.
32472464,Definitive surgery to repair the hernia can be delayed by weeks until such time as surgery can be safely arranged.
32472464,The use of taxis in emergency inguinal hernia is a useful first line of treatment in areas or situations where surgical care is not immediately available, including the COVID-19 pandemic.
32472464,Emergency surgery remains the mainstay of management in the strangulated hernia setting.
32472653,Severe cases of COVID-19 infection, often leading to death, have been associated with variants of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
32472653,Cell therapy with mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) is a potential treatment for COVID-19 ARDS based on preclinical and clinical studies supporting the concept that MSCs modulate the inflammatory and remodeling processes and restore alveolo-capillary barriers.
32472653,The authors performed a systematic literature review and random-effects meta-analysis to determine the potential value of MSC therapy for treating COVID-19-infected patients with ARDS.
32472653,Publications in all languages from 1990 to March 31, 2020 were reviewed, yielding 2691 studies, of which nine were included.
32472653,MSCs were intravenously or intratracheally administered in 200 participants, who were followed for 14 days to 5 years.
32472653,All MSCs were allogeneic from bone marrow, umbilical cord, menstrual blood, adipose tissue, or unreported sources.
32472653,Combined mortality showed a favorable trend but did not reach statistical significance.
32472653,No related serious adverse events were reported and mild adverse events resolved spontaneously.
32472653,A trend was found of improved radiographic findings, pulmonary function (lung compliance, tidal volumes, PaO<sub>2</sub> /FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio, alveolo-capillary injury), and inflammatory biomarker levels.
32472653,No comparisons were made between MSCs of different sources.
32472655,A group of patients with pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were reported from China in December 2019.
32472655,Although several antiviral drugs are widely tested, none of them has been approved as specific antiviral therapy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32472655,Accumulating evidence established a hyperinflammatory states or cytokine storm in COVID-19.
32472655,Among these cytokines, IL-6 plays a key role in cytokine storm and can predict the adverse clinical outcomes and fatality in these patients.
32472655,Based on the evidence of the significant role of IL-6 in cytokine storm, diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases as principal comorbidities, it seems that anti-cytokine therapy may be useful in patients with severe COVID-19 to reduce mortality.
32472655,Recent studies demonstrated that herbal-derived natural products had immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory properties and exhibited exceptional act on mediators of inflammation.
32472655,Parthenolide is the principal sesquiterpene lactones and the main biologically active constituent Tanacetum parthenium (commonly known as feverfew) which has could significantly reduce IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α production pathways established in several human cell line models in vitro and in vivo studies.
32472655,Therefore, parthenolide may be one of the herbal candidates for clinical evaluation.

32472827,The novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is infecting hundreds of thousands of humans around the globe.
32472827,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is known to generate mild as well as critical courses.
32472827,Complications on the intensive care units include acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute cardiac, and kidney injury as well as shock.
32472827,Here, we present the first case report of a successful treatment of a COVID-19 patient presenting with adult respiratory distress syndrome plus refractory combined cardiogenic and vasoplegic shock, which could be successfully stabilized after implantation of a percutaneous ventricular assist device plus an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.
32472827,Although such intense treatment might not be feasible in case of a health care disaster as described for the hot spots of the COVID-19 pandemic, it might encourage treatment of younger patients on intensive care units not overcrowded by critically ill patients.
32472897,Coronavírus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a virus of mass dissemination, with an impact on international public health, leading to hospitalizations and death.
32472897,The main symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, fatigue, dry cough; however, myalgia and dyspnea and the transmission routes include direct transmission by cough, sneeze, droplet inhalation, or contact transmission with the oral, nasal, or eye mucous membranes.
32472897,The dental professionals are the main risk group to COVID-19 due to the transmission routes that are directly related to the dental practice.
32472897,In addition, the oral and maxillofacial surgeons (OMFS) are even more exposed, due to increased contact with the population in hospitals and emergency services.
32472897,OMFS should be able to identify a suspected case of COVID-19, its symptoms, risk groups, disease severity, laboratorial and computed tomography alterations, and treatment guidelines.
32472897,In the present study, the authors performed a nationwide survey with Brazilian OMFS to evaluate the knowledge of these professionals about the pandemic status of the COVID-19.
32472897,A total of 142 OMFS replied the survey and the results brings light to an incomparable health public problem that the OMFS in Brazil are no able to protect itself, diagnose the suspicious and probable cases, request and interpret the correct laboratorial examinations for the treatment of the COVID-19 patients.
32472989,SARS-CoV-2 is spreading rapidly all over the world.
32472989,The case fatality rate seems higher in cardiovascular disease and hypertension.
32472989,Other comorbidities do not seem to confer the same risk, therefore the understanding of the relationship between infection and cardiovascular system could be a crucial point for the fight against the virus.
32472989,A great interest is currently directed towards the angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ACE 2) which is the SARS-CoV-2 receptor and creates important connections between the virus replication pathway, the cardiovascular system and blood pressure.
32472989,All cardiovascular conditions share an imbalance of the renin angiotensin system (RAAS) in which ACE 2 plays a central role.
32472989,In the last few days, much confusion has appeared about the management of therapy with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-i) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in infected patients and in those at risk of critical illness in case of infection.
32472989,In this article we will try to reorder the major opinions currently emerging on this topic.
32472991,From first cases reported on December 31, 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei-China, SARS-CoV2 has spread worldwide and finally the World Health Organization declared the pandemic status.
32472991,We summarize what makes SARS-CoV2 different from previous highly pathogenic coronaviruses and why it is so contagious, with focus on its clinical presentation and diagnosis, which is mandatory to start the appropriate management and reduce the transmission.
32472991,As far as infection pathophysiology is still not completely clarified, this review focuses also on the cardiovascular (CV) implication of COVID-19 and the capability of this virus to cause direct myocardial injury, myocarditis and other CV manifestations.
32472991,Furthermore, we highlight the relationship between the virus, enzyme ACE2 and ACE inhibitors.
32472991,Clinical management involves the intensive care approach with intubation and mechanical ventilation in the most serious cases and drug therapy with several apparently promising old and new molecules.
32472991,Aim of this review is then to summarize what is actually known about the SARS-CoV2 and its cardiovascular implications.
32473020,Around the world, several dose regimens of hydroxychloroquine have been used for COVID-19 infection treatment, with the objective of identifying a short-term course.
32473020,Hydroxychloroquine was found to decrease the viral replication in a concentration-dependent manner in vitro and to be more active when added prior to the viral challenge.
32473020,A loading dose is used to rapidly attain a target drug concentration, which is usually considered as approximately the steady-state concentration.
32473020,With a loading dose, the minimum effective concentration is reached much more rapidly than when using only the maintenance dose from the start.
32473020,Thus, we propose a hydroxychloroquine sulphate dose regimen of 400 mg twice daily at Day 1 then 400 mg once daily from Day 2 to Day 10.
32473020,We aim to evaluate this in the C-20-15 DisCoVeRy trial.
32473070,The world is facing a viral pandemic of a new coronavirus called COVID-19.
32473070,Pentoxifylline is a methyl-xanthine and it inhibits phosphodiesterase IV (PDE IV).
32473070,This drug is known for its unique features as an immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory agent, also it could have antiviral affects.
32473070,This is a scoping review, in which all related articles on COVID-19 and the probable benefits of Pentoxifylline against COVID-19 pathogenesis, in Medline, Scopus, Web of Sciences and Google Scholar up to March 20, 2020 with proper keywords including: pentoxifylline, Pentoxil, COVID-19, coronavirus, treatment, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, anti-fibrosis, oxygenation, circulation, bronchodilator, ARDS and organ failure.
32473070,We found many confirmatory data on proper efficacy of pentoxifylline n controlling COVID-19 and its consequences.
32473070,The antiviral, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, immune-modulatory, bronchodilator and respiratory supportive effects and protective roles in organ failures of PTX, along with its main functions means better circulation-oxygenation properties, low price and safety, make it a promising drug to be considered for covid-19 treatment, especially as an adjuvant therapy in combination with other drugs.

32473109,COVID-19 disease, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread globally, and no proven treatments are available.
32473109,Convalescent plasma therapy has been used with varying degrees of success to treat severe microbial infections for more than 100 years.
32473109,Patients (n = 25) with severe and/or life-threatening COVID-19 disease were enrolled at the Houston Methodist hospitals from March 28 - April 14, 2020.
32473109,Patients were transfused with convalescent plasma obtained from donors with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and had recovered.
32473109,The primary study outcome was safety, and the secondary outcome was clinical status at day 14 post-transfusion.
32473109,Clinical improvement was assessed based on a modified World Health Organization 6-point ordinal scale and laboratory parameters.
32473109,Viral genome sequencing was performed on donor and recipient strains.
32473109,At day 7 post-transfusion with convalescent plasma, nine patients had at least a 1-point improvement in clinical scale, and seven of those were discharged.
32473109,By day 14 post-transfusion, 19 (76%) patients had at least a 1-point improvement in clinical status and 11 were discharged.
32473109,No adverse events as a result of plasma transfusion were observed.
32473109,Whole genome sequencing data did not identify a strain genotype-disease severity correlation.
32473109,The data indicate that administration of convalescent plasma is a safe treatment option for those with severe COVID-19 disease.
32473124,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spread rapidly across the USA, causing extensive morbidity and mortality, particularly in the African American community.
32473124,Autopsy can considerably contribute to our understanding of many disease processes and could provide crucial information to guide management of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32473124,We report on the relevant cardiopulmonary findings in, to our knowledge, the first autopsy series of ten African American decedents, with the cause of death attributed to COVID-19.
32473124,Autopsies were performed on ten African American decedents aged 44-78 years with cause of death attributed to COVID-19, reflective of the dominant demographic of deaths following COVID-19 diagnosis in New Orleans.
32473124,Autopsies were done with consent of the decedents' next of kin.
32473124,Pulmonary and cardiac features were examined, with relevant immunostains to characterise the inflammatory response, and RNA labelling and electron microscopy on representative sections.
32473124,Important findings include the presence of thrombosis and microangiopathy in the small vessels and capillaries of the lungs, with associated haemorrhage, that significantly contributed to death.
32473124,Features of diffuse alveolar damage, including hyaline membranes, were present, even in patients who had not been ventilated.
32473124,Cardiac findings included individual cell necrosis without lymphocytic myocarditis.
32473124,There was no evidence of secondary pulmonary infection by microorganisms.
32473124,We identify key pathological states, including thrombotic and microangiopathic pathology in the lungs, that contributed to death in patients with severe COVID-19 and decompensation in this demographic.
32473124,Management of these patients should include treatment to target these pathological mechanisms.
32473124,None.
32473161,The many variations on a graphic illustrating the impact of non-pharmaceutical measures to mitigate pandemic influenza that have appeared in recent news reports about COVID-19 suggest a need to better explain the mechanism by which social distancing reduces the spread of infectious diseases.
32473161,And some reports understate one benefit of reducing the frequency or proximity of interpersonal encounters, a reduction in the total number of infections.
32473161,In hopes that understanding will increase compliance, we describe how social distancing a) reduces the peak incidence of infections, b) delays the occurrence of this peak, and c) reduces the total number of infections during epidemics.
32473161,In view of the extraordinary efforts underway to identify existing medications that are active against SARS-CoV-2 and to develop new antiviral drugs, vaccines and antibody therapies, any of which may have community-level effects, we also describe how pharmaceutical interventions affect transmission.
32473179,Single-use filtering face respirators (FFRs) are critical pieces of personal protective equipment for healthcare workers treating patients with suspected upper respiratory tract pathogens.
32473179,Experiences during pandemics in the 2000s, as well as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-2-CoV2, have highlighted concerns over the pressures that sustained respiratory virus pandemics may have on supplies of FFRs globally.
32473179,Decontamination of FFRs has been posited as one solution to support the re-use of FFRs with a growing body of literature over the last 10+ years beginning to examine both the efficacy of disinfection of contaminated FFRs but also the impact of the decontamination process on the FFR's performance.
32473179,Physical and chemical methods of decontamination have been tested for treatment of FFRs with ultraviolet germicidal irradiation, sterilization by steam, ethylene oxide and vaporous hydrogen peroxide, demonstrating the most promising results thus far.
32473179,Many of these methods utilize existing equipment that may already be available in hospitals and could be re-purposed for FFR decontamination.
32473179,Importantly, some methods may also be replicated on household equipment, broadening the utility of FFR decontamination across a range of healthcare settings.
32473179,Utilizing techniques to experimentally contaminate FFRs with a range of microorganisms, most decontamination methods appear to reduce the risk of the mask as a source of infection to the wearer and others to negligible levels.
32473179,The performance of the filter, especially the efficiency of particle penetration following treatment, varied greatly depending on the processing method as well as the model of the filter itself, however.
32473179,Urgent regulatory body-supported research is required to endorse the routine decontamination of FFRs.
32473179,In emergency settings, these methods should nevertheless be carefully considered as one strategy to address potential shortfalls in supplies of FFRs for healthcare workers.
32473230,No specific treatment against SARS-CoV-2 is available after 6 months of COVID-19 worldwide outbreak Antivirals could decrease the viral load and reduce direct and indirect damages of SARSCoV-2 infection Ritonavir-bosted lopinavir is effective against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro Sequential virological and pharmacological monitoring helped to understand the efficacy of ritonavir-boosted lopinavir in a SARS-CoV-2 infected patient Ritonavir-boosted lopinavir could be proposed as early treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32473310,Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the emerging severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is associated with a crude case fatality rate of about 0.5-10% depending on locality.
32473310,A few clinically approved drugs, such as remdesivir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, nafamostat, camostat, and ivermectin, exhibited anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in vitro and/or in a small number of patients.
32473310,However, their clinical use may be limited by anti-SARS-CoV-2 50% maximal effective concentrations (EC<sub>50</sub>) that exceeded their achievable peak serum concentrations (Cmax), side effects, and/or availability.
32473310,To find more immediately available COVID-19 antivirals, we established a two-tier drug screening system that combines SARS-CoV-2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and cell viability assay, and applied it to screen a library consisting 1528 FDA-approved drugs.
32473310,Cetilistat (anti-pancreatic lipase), diiodohydroxyquinoline (anti-parasitic), abiraterone acetate (synthetic androstane steroid), and bexarotene (antineoplastic retinoid) exhibited potent in vitro anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity (EC<sub>50</sub> 1.13-2.01µM).
32473310,Bexarotene demonstrated the highest Cmax:EC<sub>50</sub> ratio (1.69) which was higher than those of chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and ivermectin.
32473310,These results demonstrated the efficacy of the two-tier screening system and identified potential COVID-19 treatments which can achieve effective levels if given by inhalation or systemically depending on their pharmacokinetics.
32473390,SARS-CoV2 is a source of coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19), this is considered as a fatal disease to universal communal health apprehension.
32473390,This rapid pathogenic virus plays an important role in finding the pathogenic virus, treatment and prevention of pandemics.
32473390,Virus can present everywhere in Global village.
32473390,As it is virus it can extend easily and cause severe illness to the society.
32473390,Hence, an efficient international attentiveness of plan is necessary to the prediction and prevention.
32473390,In this review, epidemic outbreak, clinical findings, prevention recommendations of COVID-19 and suggestive medicinal value of south Indian plant sources has been discussed.
32473390,Though the varieties of improved approaches have been taken in scientific and medicinal concern, we have to pay attention on medicinal value of the plant based sources to prevent these types of endemic diseases.
32473390,This is one of the suggestive and effective ways to control the spreading of viruses.
32473390,In future its required to provide medicinal plant based clinical products (Masks, sanitizers, soap etc.) with better techniques by clinicians to contend the scarcity and expose towards the nature based medicine rather than chemical drugs.
32473390,This could be a benchmark for the economical clinical trials of specific plant material to treat the viral diseases.
32473418,Rheumatologists must contend with COVID-19 pandemic in the management of their patients and many questions have been raised on the use of both anti-inflammatory drugs and disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARD).
32473418,The French Society of Rheumatology (SFR) selected the most critical ones to the daily practice of a rheumatologist and a group of 10 experts from SFR and Club Rheumatism and Inflammation (CRI) boards proposed responses based on the current knowledge of May 2020.
32473418,Following the availability of the first 18 questions and statements, 1400 individuals consulted the frequently asked questions between the March 31, 2020 and April 12, 2020.
32473418,As a result, 16 additional questions were forwarded to the SFR, and answered by the board.
32473418,An additional round of review by email and video conference was organized, which included updates of the previous statements.
32473418,The scientific relevance of 5 of the questions led to their inclusion in this document.
32473418,Each response received a final assessment on a scale of 0-10 with 0 meaning no agreement whatsoever and 10 being in complete agreement.
32473418,The mean values of these votes for each question are presented as the levels of agreement (LoA) at the end of each response.
32473418,This document was last updated on April 17, 2020.
32473418,Based on current scientific literature already published, in most circumstances, there is no contraindication to the initiation or continuation of anti-inflammatory drugs as well as DMARDs.
32473418,If signs suggestive of infection (coronavirus or other) occurs, treatments should be discontinued and resumed, if necessary, after 2 weeks without any symptoms.
32473418,Only, some signals suggest that people taking an immunosuppressive dose of corticosteroid therapy are at greater risk of developing severe COVID-19.
32473418,Intra-articular injections of glucocorticoids are allowed when there is no reasonable therapeutic alternative, and providing that precautions to protect the patient and the practitioner from viral contamination are adopted, included appropriate information to the patient.
32473418,Currently available data on managing patients with rheumatic diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic are reassuring and support continuing or initiating symptomatic as well as specific treatments of these diseases, the main target of their management remaining their appropriate control, even during this pandemic.
32473509,Zinc Iodide and Dimethyl Sulfoxide compositions are proposed as therapeutic agents to treat and prevent chronic and acute viral infections including SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.
32473509,The therapeutic combinations have a wide range of virucidal effects on DNA and RNA containing viruses.
32473509,The combinations also exhibit anti-inflammatory, immunomodulating, antifibrotic, antibacterial, antifungal and antioxidative effects.
32473509,Given the fact that Zinc Iodide has been used as an oral antiseptic agent and DMSO has been already proven as a safe pharmaceutical solvent and therapeutic agent, we hypothesize that the combination of these two agents can be applied as an effective, safe and inexpensive treatment for SARS-CoV-2 and other viral infection.
32473509,The therapeutic compound can be applied as both etiological and pathogenesis therapy and used as an effective and safe antiseptic (disinfectant) for human and animals as well.
32473600,Baricitinib, is an oral Janus kinase (JAK)1/JAK2 inhibitor approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) that was independently predicted, using artificial intelligence (AI)-algorithms, to be useful for COVID-19 infection via a proposed anti-cytokine effects and as an inhibitor of host cell viral propagation.
32473600,We evaluated the in vitro pharmacology of baricitinib across relevant leukocyte subpopulations coupled to its in vivo pharmacokinetics and showed it inhibited signaling of cytokines implicated in COVID-19 infection.
32473600,We validated the AI-predicted biochemical inhibitory effects of baricitinib on human numb-associated kinase (hNAK) members measuring nanomolar affinities for AAK1, BIKE, and GAK.
32473600,Inhibition of NAKs led to reduced viral infectivity with baricitinib using human primary liver spheroids.
32473600,These effects occurred at exposure levels seen clinically.
32473600,In a case series of patients with bilateral COVID-19 pneumonia, baricitinib treatment was associated with clinical and radiologic recovery, a rapid decline in SARS-CoV-2 viral load, inflammatory markers, and IL-6 levels.
32473600,Collectively, these data support further evaluation of the anti-cytokine and anti-viral activity of baricitinib and supports its assessment in randomized trials in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
32473607,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been associated with acute liver injury manifested by increased liver enzymes in reports worldwide.
32473607,Prevalence of liver injury and associated clinical characteristics are not well-defined.
32473607,We aim to identify the prevalence of and risk factors for development of COVID-19 associated acute liver injury in a large cohort in the United States.
32473607,In this retrospective cohort study, all patients who underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing at three hospitals in the NewYork-Presbyterian network were assessed.
32473607,Of 3381 patients, 2273 tested positive and had higher initial and peak ALT than those who tested negative.
32473607,Acute liver injury was categorized as mild if alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was &gt; upper limit of normal (ULN) but &lt; two times ULN, moderate if ALT was between two and five times ULN, and severe if ALT was &gt; five times ULN.
32473607,Among patients who tested positive, 45% had mild, 21% moderate, and 6.4% severe liver injury.
32473607,In multivariable analysis, severe acute liver injury was significantly associated with elevated inflammatory markers including ferritin (OR 2.40, p&lt;0.001) and IL-6 (OR 1.45, p=0.009).
32473607,Patients with severe liver injury had a more severe clinical course, including higher rates of ICU admission (69%), intubation (65%), renal replacement therapy (33%), and mortality (42%).
32473607,In multivariable analysis, peak ALT was significantly associated with death or discharge to hospice (OR 1.14, p=0.044), controlling for age, body mass index, diabetes, hypertension, intubation, and renal replacement therapy.
32473607,Acute liver injury is common in patients who test positive for SARS-CoV-2, but is most often mild.
32473607,However, among the 6.4% of patients with severe liver injury, a severe disease course should be anticipated.
