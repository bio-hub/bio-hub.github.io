31944312,Identification of the causative viral pathogens of respiratory tract viral infections is important to select an appropriate treatment, save people's lives, stop the epidemics, and avoid unnecessary use of antibiotics.
31981224,In this review, we provide an update on CoV infections and relevant diseases, particularly the host defense against CoV-induced inflammation of lung tissue, as well as the role of the innate immune system in the pathogenesis and clinical treatment.
31986264,We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.
31996494,At present, there is no vaccine or antiviral treatment for human and animal coronavirus, so that identifying the drug treatment options as soon as possible is critical for the response to the 2019-nCoV outbreak.
31996494,Three general methods, which include existing broad-spectrum antiviral drugs using standard assays, screening of a chemical library containing many existing compounds or databases, and the redevelopment of new specific drugs based on the genome and biophysical understanding of individual coronaviruses, are used to discover the potential antiviral treatment of human pathogen coronavirus.
31996494,Lopinavir /Ritonavir, Nucleoside analogues, Neuraminidase inhibitors, Remdesivir, peptide (EK1), abidol, RNA synthesis inhibitors (such as TDF, 3TC), anti-inflammatory drugs (such as hormones and other molecules), Chinese traditional medicine, such ShuFengJieDu Capsules and Lianhuaqingwen Capsule, could be the drug treatment options for 2019-nCoV.
32017984,Here, we focus on advances in research and development of fast diagnosis methods, as well as potential prophylactics and therapeutics to prevent or treat 2019-nCoV infection.
32020915,Herein, we present on an overview of the currently available information on the pathogenesis, epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of this virus.
32022370,The spike protein used for host cell infection shows key nonsynonymous mutations that might hamper the efficacy of previously developed therapeutics but remains a viable target for the development of biologics and macrocyclic peptides.
32023681,To standardize the diagnosis and treatment of this new infectious disease, operational guidelines for the diagnosis and management of 2019-nCoV infection is accomplished by Peking Union Medical College Hospital.
32023682,The outbreak of pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV in Wuhan, Hubei province of China, at the end of 2019 shaped tremendous challenges to China's public health and clinical treatment.
32023684,Based on current studies, the author summarized the clinical characteristics and evolution of the novel viral pneumonia, and proposed the key points of diagnosis and treatment, the scientific management of both confirmed and suspected cases, and the scientific management of disease prevention and control.
32026148,Following the latest National recommendations for diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia caused by 2019-nCoV (the 4th edition) and current status of clinical practice in Zhejiang Province, recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of respiratory infection caused by 2019-nCoV for children were drafted by the National Clinical Research Center for Child Health, the National Children's Regional Medical Center, Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine to further standardize the protocol for diagnosis and treatment of respiratory infection in children caused by 2019-nCoV.
32027631,Although these measures might not prevent the eventual establishment of ongoing, widespread transmission of the virus in the United States, they are being implemented to 1) slow the spread of illness; 2) provide time to better prepare health care systems and the general public to be ready if widespread transmission with substantial associated illness occurs; and 3) better characterize 2019-nCoV infection to guide public health recommendations and the development of medical countermeasures including diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines.
32029004,For it is a never been experienced respiratory disease before and with infection ability widely and quickly, it attracted the world's attention but without treatment and control manual.
32029004,This guideline includes the guideline methodology, epidemiological characteristics, disease screening and population prevention, diagnosis, treatment and control (including traditional Chinese Medicine), nosocomial infection prevention and control, and disease nursing of the 2019-nCoV.
32029004,Moreover, we also provide a whole process of a successful treatment case of the severe 2019-nCoV infected pneumonia and experience and lessons of hospital rescue for 2019-nCoV infections.
32031570,Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data were collected and analyzed.
32031570,Most patients received antiviral therapy (oseltamivir, 124 [89.9%]), and many received antibacterial therapy (moxifloxacin, 89 [64.4%]; ceftriaxone, 34 [24.6%]; azithromycin, 25 [18.1%]) and glucocorticoid therapy (62 [44.9%]).
32031570,Of the 36 cases in the ICU, 4 (11.1%) received high-flow oxygen therapy, 15 (41.7%) received noninvasive ventilation, and 17 (47.2%) received invasive ventilation (4 were switched to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation).
32033513,the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China publish the guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection (trial version 5) .
32034659,This statement is based on the Novel Coronavirus Infection Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Standards (the fourth edition) (National Health Committee) and other previous diagnosis and treatment strategies for pediatric virus infections.
32034659,The present consensus statement summarizes current strategies on diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of 2019-nCoV infection in children.
32035428,At present, the prevention and treatment of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in China has reached a critical stage.
32037389,No effective antiviral treatment has been verified thus far.
32037389,All the patients were given antiviral treatment including lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra<sup>®</sup>), arbidol, and Shufeng Jiedu Capsule (SFJDC, a traditional Chinese medicine) and other necessary support care.
32037389,After treatment, three patients gained significant improvement in pneumonia associated symptoms, two of whom were confirmed 2019-nCoV negative and discharged, and one of whom was virus negative at the first test.
32037389,Results obtained in the current study may provide clues for treatment of 2019-nCoV pneumonia.
32037389,The efficacy of antiviral treatment including lopinavir/ritonavir, arbidol, and SFJDC warrants further verification in future study.
32040667,Oseltamivir is the most widely used neuraminidase inhibitor for treatment of influenza; data suggest that early use is associated with reduced mortality in critically ill patients with influenza.
32040667,Limited existing knowledge highlights the need for data regarding supportive care and adjunctive pharmacologic therapy that is specific for critically ill patients with severe RVI.
32040667,There is a need for more pragmatic and efficient designs to test different therapeutics both individually and in combination.
32044814,This study aims to investigate its epidemiologic history, and analyze the clinical characteristics, treatment regimens, and prognosis of patients infected with 2019-nCoV during this outbreak.
32044814,Clinical data from 137 2019-nCoV-infected patients admitted to the respiratory departments of the respiratory departments of nine tertiary hospitals in Hubei province from December 30, 2019 to January 24, 2020 were retrospectively collected, including general status, clinical manifestations, laboratory test results, imaging characteristics, and treatment regimens.
32044814,Given the lack of effective drugs, treatment focused on symptomatic and respiratory support.
32044814,Systemic corticosteroid treatment did not show significant benefits.
32048163,Our results suggest a number of potential diagnosis biomarkers and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) drugs for potential repurposing treatment of 2019-nCoV infection.
32049687,Currently, there is no definite treatment for SSCP although some drugs are under investigation.
32051071,The perinatal-neonatal departments should cooperate closely and take integrated approaches, and the neonatal intensive care unit should prepare the emergency plan for 2019-nCoV infection as far as possible, so as to ensure the optimal management and treatment of potential victims.
32051072,During the epidemic of 2019-nCoV, the emergency response plan for the NICU should be based on the actual situation, including diagnosis, isolation, and treatment, as well as available equipment and staffing, and take into account the psychosocial needs of the families and neonatal care staff.
32051073,In order to further standardize and enhance the clinical management of 2019-nCoV infection in children, reduce the incidence, and decrease the number of severe cases, we have formulated this diagnosis and treatment recommendation according to the recent information at home and abroad.
32052466,In the absence of treatment for this virus, there is an urgent need to find alternative methods to control the spread of disease.
32052466,Here, we have conducted an online search for all treatment options related to coronavirus infections as well as some RNA-virus infection and we have found that general treatments, coronavirus-specific treatments, and antiviral treatments should be useful in fighting COVID-19.
32054787,Here, we tested the efficacy of prophylactic and therapeutic remdesivir treatment in a nonhuman primate model of MERS-CoV infection, the rhesus macaque.
32054787,Prophylactic remdesivir treatment initiated 24 h prior to inoculation completely prevented MERS-CoV-induced clinical disease, strongly inhibited MERS-CoV replication in respiratory tissues, and prevented the formation of lung lesions.
32054787,Therapeutic remdesivir treatment initiated 12 h postinoculation also provided a clear clinical benefit, with a reduction in clinical signs, reduced virus replication in the lungs, and decreased presence and severity of lung lesions.
32054787,The data presented here support testing of the efficacy of remdesivir treatment in the context of a MERS clinical trial.
32057209,We here share the therapeutic experiences of NCP treatment with literature review.
32060789,With high human-to-human transmission rate (R0), 2019-nCoV has quickly spread in China and other countries, resulting in 34,953 confirmed cases and 725 deaths as of 8 February 2020, thus calling for urgent development of therapeutics and prophylactics.
32061198,At present, there is no definite and effective treatment for COVID-19.
32061200,After 3 to 5 days of treatment, 2019-nCoV nucleic acid in a second respiratory sample turned negative in 6 cases.
32064854,Residents have a high awareness rate of the main symptoms, transmission routes, using of masks, hand washing and treatment information of NCP, while a low awareness rate of the atypical symptoms.
32064855,Among the 7 patients, 1 case died of (B) aggravation, and the other patients' condition was effectively controlled after active treatment.
32065055,Currently, however, there is no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine.
32065055,These results suggest that CR3022 may have the potential to be developed as candidate therapeutics, alone or in combination with other neutralizing antibodies, for the prevention and treatment of 2019-nCoV infections.
32065348,Historical records on prevention and treatment of infections in CM classics, clinical evidence of CM on the prevention of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and H1N1 influenza, and CM prevention programs issued by health authorities in China since the COVID-19 outbreak were retrieved from different databases and websites till 12 February, 2020.
32072919,This guideline is applicable to the health protection requirements of large indoor stadiums which are reconstructed as treatment sites for the Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (NPC) patients with mild symptoms during the outbreak.
32074550,The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) virus is spreading rapidly, and scientists are endeavoring to discover drugs for its efficacious treatment in China.
32074550,Chloroquine phosphate, an old drug for treatment of malaria, is shown to have apparent efficacy and acceptable safety against COVID-19 associated pneumonia in multicenter clinical trials conducted in China.
32074550,The drug is recommended to be included in the next version of the Guidelines for the Prevention, Diagnosis, and Treatment of Pneumonia Caused by COVID-19 issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China for treatment of COVID-19 infection in larger populations in the future.
32074786,As surgeons specialized in the treatment of gastrointestinal tumors, we should always be aware of the prevention for NCP and incorporate this awareness into every detail of clinical practice.
32074786,For malignant tumor, multidisciplinary therapy (MDT) is recommended and non-surgical anti-tumor therapy should be selected with higher priority.
32074786,Neoadjuvant therapy is highly recommended for gastrointestinal cancer at advanced stages that meet the indications of NCCN guideline (gastric cancer T stage ≥ 2/rectal cancer T stage ≥ 3/unresectable colon cancer).
32074786,However, emergency operation still must be performed for patients with acute uncontrolled bleeding, obstruction or after other alternative treatment measures fail.
32075365,Here we found that treating the patients diagnosed as novel coronavirus pneumonia with chloroquine might improve the success rate of treatment, shorten hospital stay and improve patient outcome.
32075365,In order to guide and regulate the use of chloroquine in patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia, the multicenter collaboration group of Department of Science and Technology of Guangdong Province and Health Commission of Guangdong Province for chloroquine in the treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia developed this expert consensus after extensive discussion.
32077440,For patients with lung occupying lesions, the whole process of diagnosis and treatment can not be carried out as usual due to the epidemic.
32077440,All thoracic surgeons in China should work together to develop the proper procedures for the diagnosis and treatment in this special situation, and continuously update the recommendations based on epidemic changes and further understanding of COVID-19.
32077441,With the spread of COVID-19, the routine clinical diagnosis and treatment for lung cancer patients has been disturbed.
32077441,During the COVID-19 outbreak period, it should be carefully differentiated for fever and respiratory symptoms for lung cancer patients receiving anti-tumor treatment, in order to evaluate the risk of COVID-19.
32077660,Clinical classification (mild, moderate, severe, and critical) was carried out according to the diagnosis and treatment program of novel coronavirus pneumonia (Trial Fifth Edition) issued by the National Health Commission.
32077660,ALT, AST, ALB and TBil of the severe or critical subgroups were 60.25 (40.88 ~ 68.90) U/L, 37.00 (20.88 ~ 64.45) U/L, 35.75 (28.68 ~ 42.00) g/L, and 20.50 (11.28 ~ 25.00) mmol/L, respectively. <b>Conclusion:</b> The results of this multicenter retrospective study suggests that novel coronavirus pneumonia combined with liver damage is more likely to be caused by adverse drug reactions and systemic inflammation in severe patients receiving medical treatment.
32077660,Therefore, liver function monitoring and evaluation should be strengthened during the treatment of such patients. <b>目的：</b> 分析新型冠状病毒肺炎病例的临床特征，初步探讨不同临床分型与肝功能损伤的关系。
32077661,As such, we developed this consensus recommendations on all those high-risk treatments, based on the current evidence as well as the resource limitation in some areas, with the aim to reduce the nosocomial transmission and optimize the treatment for the COVID-19 pneumonia patients.
32077661,Those recommendations include: (1) Standard prevention and protection, and patient isolation; (2) Patient wearing mask during HFNC treatment; (3) Using dual limb ventilator with filters placed at the ventilator outlets, or using heat-moisture exchanger (HME) instead of heated humidification in single limb ventilator with HME placed between exhalation port and mask; avoid using mask with exhalation port on the mask; (4) Placing filter between resuscitator and mask or artificial airway; (5) For spontaneous breathing patients, placing mask for patients during bronchoscopy examination; for patients receiving noninvasive ventilation, using the special mask with bronchoscopy port to perform bronchoscopy; (6) Using sedation and paralytics during intubation, cuff pressure should be maintained between 25-30 cmH(2)O; (7) In-line suction catheter is recommended and it can be used for one week; (8) Dual-limb heated wire circuits are recommended and only changed with visible soiled; (9.
32077661,(11) Avoid unnecessary bronchial hygiene therapy; (12) For patients who need aerosol therapy, dry powder inhaler metered dose inhaler with spacer is recommended for spontaneous breathing patients; while vibrating mesh nebulizer is recommended for ventilated patients and additional filter is recommended to be placed at the expiratory port of ventilation during nebulization.
32078069,According to the current status, blocking transmission, isolation, protection, and alternative medication are the urgent management strategies against 2019-nCoV.
32079150,The mean time from illness onset to hospital admission (for treatment and/or isolation) was estimated at 3-4 days without truncation and at 5-9 days when right truncated.
32080994,Complying with overall requirements of the government and regulations on public health emergences, as well as the clinical features of diagnosis and treatment of dental illness, this paper refers to previous guidelines and studies on the infection prevention and control in dental diagnosis and treatment in China and foreign countries.
32084675,By summarizing the research progress and guidelines in recent years in the fields of colorectal cancer disease screening, treatment strategies(including early colorectal cancer, locally advanced colorectal cancer, obstructive colorectal cancer, metastatic colorectal cancer and the treatment of patients after neoadjuvant therapy), the choice of medication and time limit for adjuvant therapy, the protective measures for patients undergoing emergency surgery, the re-examination of postoperative patients and the protection of medical staff, etc., authors improve treatment strategies in order to provide more choices for patients to obtain the best treatment under the severe epidemic situation of new coronavirus pneumonia.
32084675,Meanwhile we hope that it can also provide more timely treatment modeling schemes for colleagues.
32084676,Referring to the &quot;Diagnosis and Treatment Scheme for NCP (Trial Version 4 and 5)&quot; and combining the actual practice situation in our hospital with the &quot;Summary of New Coronavirus Files of Shanghai Renji Hospital&quot;, we summarize how to carry out the clinical practice of colorectal surgery under the situation of the prevention and control of the NCP epidemiology, meanwhile under such situation aiming the procedure of diagnose and treatment for emergency patients with colorectal tumor, we share the experiences of the diagnosis of colorectal tumor, the management of patients with colorectal cancer who are scheduled to be admitted for surgery, the protection of wards, the perioperative management.
32084676,The main points are as follows: (1) Multidisciplinary team (MDT) must be run through the diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer.
32086886,The outbreak of the novel coronavirus has affected the normal diagnosis and treatment services in oral medical institutions across the country.
32086886,Delay of non-emergency dental service will have a potential impact on the experience, cognition, treatment and rehabilitation of patients with oral diseases.
32086886,At the same time, this paper analyzes the possible psychological stress symptoms of patients with different oral diseases, and puts forward suggestions for remote consultation and emergency treatment of dentists.
32086938,Utilizing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, USA) website, and a comprehensive review of PubMed literature, we obtained information regarding clinical signs and symptoms, treatment and diagnosis, transmission methods, protection methods and risk factors for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and COVID-19.
32087334,Herein, we describe the epidemic and etiological characteristics of 2019-nCoV, discuss its essential biological features, including tropism and receptor usage, summarize approaches for disease prevention and treatment, and speculate on the transmission route of 2019-nCoV.
32087621,We will share the treatment experience of severe NCP with the first-line treatment experience.
32087621,In addition, there is up regulation of inflammatory factors in patients with severe NCP, but the effect of renal replacement therapy needs to be further confirmed by clinical research.
32088333,These measures were motivated by the need to provide effective treatment of patients, and involved consultation with three major groups in policy formulation-public health experts, the government, and the general public.
32092748,This issue has rapidly reviewed and published articles describing COVID-19, including the drug treatment options for SARS-CoV-2, its clinical characteristics, and therapies involving a combination of Chinese and Western medicine, the efficacy of chloroquine phosphate in the treatment of COVID-19 associated pneumonia according to clinical studies, and reflections on the system of reserve medical supplies for public health emergencies.
32093211,Meanwhile, it is also crucial to speed up the development of vaccines and drugs for treatment, which will enable us to defeat COVID-19 as soon as possible.
32096366,The chest CT images of patients with COVID-19 have certain characteristics with dynamic changes, which are of value for monitoring disease progress and clinical treatment.
32096367,Based on the present expert consensus carried out by National Health Commission and National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, our team summarized and established an effective treatment strategy centered on &quot;Four-Anti and Two-Balance&quot; for clinical practice.
32096367,Meanwhile, integrated multidisciplinarypersonalized treatment was recommended to improve therapeutic effect.
32096367,Early antiviral treatment could alleviate disease severity and prevent illness progression, and we found lopinavir/ritonavir combined with abidol showed antiviraleffects in COVID-19.
32096367,The artificial liver blood purification system could rapidly remove inflammatory mediators and block cytokine storm.Moreover, it also favoredthe balance of fluid, electrolyte and acid-base and thus improved treatment efficacy in critical illness.
32096367,Conservative oxygen therapy was preferred and noninvasive ventilation was not recommended.
32096367,We also integrated Chinese medicine in treatment to promote disease rehabilitation through classification methods of traditional Chinese medicine.
32096367,However, since COVID-19 was a newly emerging disease, more work was warranted to improve strategies of prevention, diagnosis and treatment for COVID-19.
32096395,The characteristics including high contagiousness, herd susceptibility and clinical phenotype diversity, made a serious influence on people's daily life and rountine therapy for other diseases.
32096395,In the central epidemic area of COVID-19, Hubei province, especially Wuhan, the clinical specialists of breast diseases should consider all of the following factors comprehensively: the prevention of COVID-19, the diagnosis and treatment of breast diseases and the accessibility of medical resources.
32096395,Besides, we should select the appropriate therapy and optimize treatment process so as to prevent the propagation and cross infection of COVID-19 as well as manage the breast diseases without delay.
32096395,Therefore, we carried out some management proposals of the patients with breast diseases in the central epidemic area during the epidemic of COVID-19 on the basis of conventional treatment guidelines and clinical experiences.
32096396,After the outbreak of this disease, the overwhelming majority of cities have launched the &quot;first level response&quot; and the regular diagnosis and treatment of cancer patients are greatly affected.
32096396,The epidemic of novel coronavirus pneumonia poses new challenges to diagnosis and treatment of the patients with digestive system malignancies.
32096396,Based on the fully understanding of the characteristics of digestive system tumors, we should change the treatment strategy and adopt more reasonable treatment strategy timely during the epidemic period to minimize the adverse effects of the epidemic of novel coronavirus pneumonia on the treatment.
32098302,The collaborative efforts of researchers are needed to fill the knowledge gaps about this new virus, to develop the proper diagnostic tools, and effective treatment to combat this infection.
32098422,The goal of this work is to systematically review and compare between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in the context of their virus incubation, originations, diagnosis and treatment methods, genomic and proteomic sequences, and pathogenic mechanisms.
32098466,According to &quot; the Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia &quot;(6th edition) of the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, a new guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of 2019 novel coronavirus infection suitable for the military (first trial version) was established.
32098466,Some unique opinions and suggestions are put forward in terms of disease name, diagnosis criteria, antiviral treatment, glucocorticoid application, etc.

32100486,After treatment, the lesions were shown to be almost absorbed leaving the fibrous lesions.
32100979,In order to prevent cluster outbreaks, the government strengthened the management and control of personnel mobility, which had a great impact on the examination and treatment of breast cancer patients.
32100979,If necessary, after professional discussion and communication between doctors and patients online or offline, the hospital visiting time should be delayed through seeking alternative treatment schemes, and psychological counseling for patients should be paid attention to at the same time.
32100980,The outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) makes the medical treatment of colorectal cancers difficult.
32100980,For metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) patients, maintenance therapy is the optimal choice.
32100980,Adjuvant chemotherapy should reduce the intensity of treatment and shorten the therapy time.
32102777,In this report, we provide comprehensive descriptions on data deposition, management, release and utility in 2019nCoVR, laying important foundations in aid of studies on virus classification and origin, genome variation and evolution, fast detection, drug development and pneumonia precision prevention and therapy.
32104915,Awareness of this may have a guiding significance for the prevention and treatment of the SARS-CoV-2-induced respiratory failure.
32104917,There is an urgent need for an accurate and rapid test method to quickly identify a large number of infected patients and asymptomatic carriers to prevent virus transmission and assure timely treatment of patients.
32105052,It has also brought great challenges to the treatment of patients with cancer.
32105052,The selection of surgical procedures and perioperative managements of esophageal cancer require all thoracic surgeons work together to figure out a reasonable system of surgical treatment and emergency response.
32105680,Principles of management of coronavirus disease 2019 in pregnancy include early isolation, aggressive infection control procedures, oxygen therapy, avoidance of fluid overload, consideration of empiric antibiotics (secondary to bacterial infection risk), laboratory testing for the virus and coinfection, fetal and uterine contraction monitoring, early mechanical ventilation for progressive respiratory failure, individualized delivery planning, and a team-based approach with multispecialty consultations.
32106216,Although these measures might not prevent widespread transmission of the virus in the United States, they are being implemented to 1) slow the spread of illness; 2) provide time to better prepare state and local health departments, health care systems, businesses, educational organizations, and the general public in the event that widespread transmission occurs; and 3) better characterize COVID-19 to guide public health recommendations and the development and deployment of medical countermeasures, including diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines.
32107909,<b>Objective:</b> To explorethe proper protective measures for pancreaticdiseases treatment during theoutbreak of 2019 coronavirus disease(COVID-19). <b>Method:</b> Clinical data of four cases of patients that suffered COVID-19from February 2(nd), 2020 to February 9(th), 2020 in pancreatic surgery were reviewed.After the first patientscuffednosocomial infection of COVID-19, the general protective measures in our department wereupdated.Only one patient was admitted to each room alone, with no more than one caregiver.The body temperature of care givers was measuredtwice a day.Primary protections were applied to all staff.The floor was sterilized using disinfectant with an effective chlorine concentration of 1000 mg/L.The protective measures for interventional procedures were as follow.Primary protection was applied to the operators ofcentral venipuncture catheter, percutaneous abdominal/pleural drainage, percutaneous retroperitoneal drainage, percutaneous transhepatic cholangial drainage and other surgical procedures with local anesthesiaand epidural anesthesia.Secondary protection was applied to the operators of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and surgical procedures with general anesthesia. <b>Results:</b> During Feb 2(nd), 2020 to Feb 9(th), 2020, four patients in our department were diagnosed with COVID-19, of which one was died of COVID-19, two were cured, and one is still in hospital for COVID-19.
32108351,We aim to summarize reliable evidence of evidence-based medicine for the treatment and prevention of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by analyzing all the published studies on the clinical characteristics of patients with SARS-CoV-2.
32108352,With more and more patients diagnosed, China has carried out more than 100 clinical studies of new coronavirus infection, including antiviral drugs, antimalarial drugs, glucocorticoids, plasma therapy, virus vaccine, and other Western drugs, while Chinese medicine research accounted for half of the studies.
32108352,Although the final results of studies will take a long time to complete, the interim research data may provide some help for the current urgent demand for drug treatment.
32108459,In addition to supporting the frontline actively, medical workers in general surgery spare no efforts in making good diagnosis and treatment of specialized diseases by optimizing treatment process, providing medical advice online, mastering indications of delayed operation and emergency operation reasonably, etc.
32108459,However, instead of continuing the traditional treatment, a new management system should be developed.
32108459,Based on the characteristics of Budd-Chiari syndrome patients in China and our experience, we divide the patients into ordinary and critical cases, and treatment strategies suitable for the epidemic period of COVID-19 are put forward for reference and discussion by physicians.
32108460,During the epidemic period, the routine diagnosis and treatment of tumor patients was affected with varying degrees.
32108460,In this special period, we performed the superiority of the multi-disciplinary team of diagnosis and treatment, achieved accurate diagnosis and treatment of patients with hepatobiliary malignant tumors, provided support for these patients with limited medical resources, and helped them to survive during the epidemic period.On the basis of fully understanding the new coronavirus pneumonia, the treatment strategy should be changed timely during the epidemic, and more appropriate treatment methods should be adopted to minimize the adverse effect of the epidemic on tumor treatment.
32109443,A retrospective analysis was performed on the imaging findings of patients confirmed with COVID-19 pneumonia who had chest CT scanning and treatment after disease onset.
32109443,CT scanning provides important bases for early diagnosis and treatment of NCP.
32110875,Rapid diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics are important interventions for the management of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak.

32111113,It's important to establish individual therapy regimens and to evaluate, monitor and adjust dynamically.
32111114,China has formally included the 2019-nCoV in the statutory notification and control system for infectious diseases according to the <i>Law of the People's Republic of China on the Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases</i>.
32111114,According to <i>the guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 (6(th) trial edition)</i>, the latest relative literature at home and abroad, the features of the COVID-19, recommendations for the COVID-19 prevention and control issued by the National Health Commission of China, and management experience of diagnosis and treatment in the related disciplines, we put forward recommendations for the medical practices of burn treatment during the outbreak of the COVID-19 in outpatient and emergency treatment, inpatient treatment, operation and ward management, etc.
32111114,We hope these recommendations could benefit the professionals of the same occupation as us and related hospital managers, improve the treatment of burn during the outbreak of the COVID-19, and avoid or reduce the risk of infection of medical staff .
32112549,Since the outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia in December 2019, the diagnosis and treatment of patients with cancer have been facing great challenges.
32112549,Although oncologists are not fighting on the front line to against the epidemic, during this special period, we should not only protect patients, their families and medical staff from the infection of novel Coronavirus, but also minimize the impact of the epidemic on the diagnosis and the treatment of patients with cancer.
32112549,Combining the guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of tumors with our clinical experience, in this epidemic period, we discuss the strategies for diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of malignant tumors of the digestive system in this article.
32112886,By Feb 10, 2020, 262 patients were transferred from the hospitals across Beijing to the designated hospitals for special treatment of the COVID-19 infected by Beijing emergency medical service.
32114744,By the end of February 25, 2020, none of the three patients developed severe 2019-nCoV pneumonia or died(two patients had been cured and discharged, while another one had been transferred to a square cabin hospital for isolation treatment).
32114747,Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has seriously affected the treatment of patients and social stability.
32114747,At present, some therapies such as interleukin-6 antibody blocker, stem cell therapy, and transfusion of convalescent plasma have been applied to counteract the cytokine storm and have made some progress.
32115733,The treatment strategy for children with Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is based on adult experience.
32117569,While vaccine research should be pursued intensely, there exists today no therapy to treat 2019-nCoV upon infection, despite an urgent need to find options to help these patients and preclude potential death.
32117569,I consider the options of drug repurposing, developing neutralizing monoclonal antibody therapy, and an oligonucleotide strategy targeting the viral RNA genome, emphasizing the promise and pitfalls of these approaches.
32117569,Finally, I advocate for the fastest strategy to develop a treatment now, which could be resistant to any mutations the virus may have in the future.
32117569,Such a treatment could help infected patients before a protective vaccine is developed and widely available in the coming months to year(s).
32118389,<b>Objective:</b> To analyze the epidemiological history, clinical manifestations, treatment and the short-term prognosis of 31 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus(2019-nCoV) infection in children from six provinces (autonomous region) in northern China. <b>Methods:</b> A retrospective analysis of the epidemiological history, clinical symptoms, signs, laboratory examinations, chest imaging, treatment and the short-term prognosis of 31 cases of 2019-nCoV was conducted.
32118389,After receiving supportive treatment, the viral nucleic acid turned negative in 25 cases within 7-23 days.
32118389,After general treatment, the short-term prognosis is good. <b>目的：</b> 分析中国北方6省（自治区）儿童2019新型冠状病毒（2019 novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV）感染者的流行病学史、临床表现、治疗及近期预后。
32118391,For those patients who can't completely deoxygenate for a long time after hospitalization, individualized treatment methods and different discharge evaluation criteria should be adopted to ensure the complete cure of patients and prevent recurrencing after discharge from hospital.
32118394,The diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer patients have been challenged greatly because of extraordinary public health measures since the lung cancer patients are a high-risk population during the COVID-19 outbreak period.
32118639,The effects of cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4)+ T lymphocytes, inflammatory indicators, and glucocorticoid treatment on viral nucleic acid clearance were analyzed.
32118639,In the 292 confirmed cases, 66 patients recovered after treatment and were included in our study.
32118639,After in-hospital treatment, patients' inflammatory indicators decreased with improved clinical condition.
32118639,The duration of viral RNA detection from oropharyngeal swabs and fecal samples in the glucocorticoid treatment group was longer than that in the non-glucocorticoid treatment group (15 days vs.
32118639,8.0 days, respectively; t = 2.550, P = 0.013) and the duration of viral RNA detection in fecal samples in the glucocorticoid treatment group was longer than that in the non-glucocorticoid treatment group (20 days vs. 11 days, respectively; t = 4.631, P &lt; 0.001).
32118639,Because of the delayed clearance of viral RNA in the glucocorticoid treatment group, glucocorticoids are not recommended in the treatment of COVID-19, especially for mild disease.
32118640,Associated results will be used to evaluate the prognosis and to find the optimal treatment regimens for COVID-19 pneumonia.
32120458,There was no significant difference in the proportion of ACEI/ARB medication between the critical group and the general group or between non-survivors and survivors (all <i>P</i>&gt;0.05). <b>Conclusion:</b> COVID-19 patients combined with CVD are associated with a higher risk of mortality.
32120929,<i>Strobilanthes cusia</i> (Nees) Kuntze is a Chinese herbal medicine used in the treatment of respiratory virus infections.
32125130,In order to achieve the overall victory of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease epidemic in this 'war', especially to prevent the disease recurrence from rebounding during the resumption of labor, the government has not loosened any control of personnel mobility, which has obviously affected the normal examination and treatment of lung cancer patients under the influence of this epidemic.
32125130,It is necessary to provide more appropriate individualized treatment recommendations for patients with lung cancer based on the epidemic situation of the patient's location and in combination with the patient's own condition.
32125130,Through active prevention of infection, timely conversion of treatment strategies, online and offline joint control, and positive psychological counseling, we significantly hope to help patients with lung cancer to survive this difficult period.
32125132,During the epidemic of COVID-19, We recommended that patients with advanced NSCLC should be treated as outpatients as possible at the nearest medical center; Patients who need to be hospitalized for antitumor treatment should be excluded from COVID-19 infection; More intensive attention should be paid to identification of COVID-19-related symptoms and adverse reactions caused by the malignancy or antitumor treatments.
32125132,Stronger personal protection should be made for advanced NSCLC patients; An intentional postponing of antitumor treatment should be considered according to patient performance status.
32125132,Treatment strategies should be made according to different types of advanced NSCLC patients and efficacy and toxicity of drugs.
32125140,The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) highlights an urgent need for therapeutics.
32125140,In this brief review, we summarize the broad antiviral activity of niclosamide and highlight its potential clinical use in the treatment of COVID-19.
32125362,Clinical course was summarized, including requirement for supplemental oxygen and intensive care and use of empirical treatment with lopinavir-ritonavir.
32125362,Some patients required supplemental oxygen and had variable clinical outcomes following treatment with an antiretroviral agent.
32125642,Currently there is no effective antiviral therapy for SARS-CoV-2 infection, which frequently leads to fatal inflammatory responses and acute lung injury.
32125642,In the absence of a proven clinical FcR blocker, the use of intravenous immunoglobulin to block FcR activation may be a viable option for the urgent treatment of pulmonary inflammation to prevent severe lung injury.
32125642,Such treatment may also be combined with systemic anti-inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids.
32129518,Therapeutics that may assist to contain its rapid spread and reduce its high mortality rates are urgently needed.
32129518,A tentative suggestion based on existing therapeutics, which would likely be resistant to new coronavirus mutations, is to use available angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1R) blockers, such as losartan, as therapeutics for reducing the aggressiveness and mortality from SARS-CoV-2 virus infections.
32129518,This commentary elaborates on the idea of considering AT1R blockers as tentative treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infections, and proposes a research direction based on datamining of clinical patient records for assessing its feasibility.
32129583,In heart failure group, the ratio of the expansion of small pulmonary veins was also higher (3/7 vs. 0, <i>P</i>=0.013), and the lung lesions can be significantly improved after effective anti-heart failure treatment.
32130038,These patients were isolated and obtained treatment.
32131151,From February 7 to 14, 2020, 246 medical staff were investigated who participated in the treatment of COVID-19 using cluster sampling , and received 230 responses, with a recovery rate of 93.5%. <b>Results:</b> The incidence of anxiety in medical staff was 23.04% (53/230), and the score of SAS was (42.91 ± 10.89).
32133830,The median of the incubation period of customer cases was 6 days, and the median of the interval between onset and medical treatment of customer cases was 7 days. <b>Conclusion:</b> This was a cluster epidemic of COVID-19, which might be associated with the exposure in the department store.
32133833,Considering the negative result of nuclear acid testing, this patient was presumptively diagnosed as viral pneumonia and an experiential anti-infection treatment had been prescribed for him. <b>Conclusions:</b> The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) complicates the clinical scenario of pulmonary infiltrates in cancer patients.
32133833,Active anti-infection treatment and surveillance of patient condition should be initiated if infectious disease is considered. <b>目的：</b> 结合化疗后出现肺内磨玻璃影的淋巴瘤患者的临床特征，分析当前新型冠状病毒肺炎（COVID-19）疫情期间肿瘤患者出现肺内浸润的鉴别诊断和临床处理思路。

32134278,The therapeutic potential of monoclonal antibodies has been well recognized in the treatment of many diseases.
32134861,Currently, there is no definite treatment for COVID-19 although some drugs are under investigation.
32141058,Due to the current lack of specific treatment and the risk of transmission during the viral incubation period, infection prevention and control of 2019-nCoV are both urgent and critical to global health.
32141619,The Chinese government has taken emergency measures to control the outbreak and has undertaken initial steps in the diagnosis and treatment of 2019 novel coronavirus infection disease (COVID-19).
32141624,Isolation and protective procedures would be less effective as more cases accrue, so the optimization of the treatment plan and the development of specific drugs would be of more importance.
32141624,Evidence from the four-phase stringent measures showed that it was significant to ensure early detection, early isolation, early treatment, adequate medical supplies, patients' being admitted to designated hospitals, and comprehensive therapeutic strategy.
32142651,A TMPRSS2 inhibitor approved for clinical use blocked entry and might constitute a treatment option.
32143502,The future of human CoV outbreaks will not only depend on how the viruses will evolve, but will also depend on how we develop efficient prevention and treatment strategies to deal with this continuous threat.
32145185,This Seminar provides an update on the current knowledge and perspectives on MERS epidemiology, virology, mode of transmission, pathogenesis, diagnosis, clinical features, management, infection control, development of new therapeutics and vaccines, and highlights unanswered questions and priorities for research, improved management, and prevention.
32145714,(3) In the treatment of uterine contraction fatigue, carbetocin or carboprost tromethamine was used more in cesarean section for pregnant women with COVID-19 (1.3±0.6), compared with Non-COVID-19 group (0.5±0.7), the difference was statistically significant (<i>P</i>=0.001). <b>Conclusions:</b> If there is an indication for obstetric surgery or critical illness of COVID-19 in pregnant women, timely termination of pregnancy will not increase the risk of premature birth and asphyxia of the newborn, but it is beneficial to the treatment and rehabilitation of maternal pneumonia.
32145716,Whatever happens, screening and isolating close contacts remains essential except for clinical treatment during the epidemic.
32145718,The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has opened a public class on the treatment, prevention and control of infectious diseases for the Chinese citizens.
32145718,In future, when combating with novel infectious diseases and public health emergencies, the response capacity of public health system and treatment capacity of clinical system will be significantly improved, while the situation on insufficient integration of prevention and treatment is bound to be reversed.
32147496,Recent publications have brought attention to the possible benefit of chloroquine, a broadly used antimalarial drug, in the treatment of patients infected by the novel emerged coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).
32147628,Several drugs such as chloroquine, arbidol, remdesivir, and favipiravir are currently undergoing clinical studies to test their efficacy and safety in the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China; some promising results have been achieved thus far.
32149769,Medicines for the treatment of 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infections are urgently needed.
32149769,This study aims to repurpose the clinically approved drugs for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a 2019-nCoV related coronavirus model.
32149769,The viral RNA yield in cells treated with 10 μmol/L CEP was 15,393-fold lower than in cells without CEP treatment ([6.48 ± 0.02] × 10vs.
32149769,Our results strongly suggest that CEP is a wide-spectrum inhibitor of pan-betacoronavirus, and clinical trial of CEP for treatment of 2019-nCoV infection is warranted.
32149773,The effectiveness of adjunctive glucocorticoid therapy uses in the management of 2019-nCoV infected patients with severe lower respiratory tract infections is not clear, and warrants further investigation.
32152082,Therapeutics that target the coronavirus alone might not be able to reverse highly pathogenic infections.
32152361,We present several distinct features of MERS transmission by employing a comprehensive approach in network research to examine both the traced relationship matrix of infected individuals and their bipartite transmission routes among healthcare facilities visited for treatment.
32153167,The National Health Commission, PRC has revised the consensus on diagnosis and treatment seven times in a short period of time, indicating the growing understanding of the disease.
32153167,We were trying to find the similarities and differences among them, and to identify clues to the diagnosis of novel coronavirus pneumonia, so as to ensure accurate diagnosis and treatment.
32153170,The liver function of all patients had recovered within one week after conventional liver protection treatment. <b>Conclusion:</b> COVID-19 combined with liver function injury may be due to the slight elevation of transaminase, mostly around the second week of the disease course.
32155789,Specific up-to-date and accurate health information (e.g., treatment, local outbreak situation) and particular precautionary measures (e.g., hand hygiene, wearing a mask) were associated with a lower psychological impact of the outbreak and lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). <i>Conclusions:</i> During the initial phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, more than half of the respondents rated the psychological impact as moderate-to-severe, and about one-third reported moderate-to-severe anxiety.
32156101,Our newly developed protocol should be helpful for a first-hand screening of the asymptomatic virus-carriers for further prevention of transmission and early intervention and treatment for the rapidly propagating virus.
32156648,Following the public-health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 30 January 2020 and the recent outbreak caused by 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) [officially renamed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)] in China and 29 other countries, we aimed to summarise the clinical aspects of the novelBetacoronavirus disease (COVID-19) and its possible clinical presentations together with suggested therapeutic algorithms for patients who may require antimicrobial treatment.
32157732,The use of mAb therapeutics has also revealed a &quot;scaffolding&quot; role for FcγR which, in different contexts, may either underpin the therapeutic mAb action such as immune agonism or trigger catastrophic adverse effects.
32157862,In this case report, we aim to define the chest computed tomography findings of 2019-novel coronavirus associated with pneumonia and its successful resolution after treatment.
32157862,Despite the given treatment, her body temperature rose to 39.2°C and she was referred to our clinic for further evaluation.
32161940,Surveillance of NLR and lymphocyte subsets is helpful in the early screening of critical illness, diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.
32162081,Three of these five had CT abnormality on the first CT scan (at 2 days, 4 days and 9 days, respectively, after onset of symptoms) in the form of patchy ground-glass opacities; all normalised during treatment.
32162456,The recently emerged 2019 Novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and associated COVID-19 disease cause serious or even fatal respiratory tract infection and yet no approved therapeutics or effective treatment is currently available to effectively combat the outbreak.
32162456,This urgent situation is pressing the world to respond with the development of novel vaccine or a small molecule therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2.
32162699,However, there is no unified standard for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.
32162699,In the retrospective analysis, we report nine cases of COVID-19, describe the history of contact, clinical manifestations, the course of diagnosis and clinical treatment before, during and after treatment.
32164424,Similar to outbreaks of other newly identified virus, there is no proven regimen from conventional medicine and most reports managed the patients with lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, beta-interferon, glucocorticoid and supportive treatment with remdesivir undergoing clinical trial.
32164424,In China, Chinese medicine is proposed as a treatment option by national and provincial guidelines with substantial utilization.
32164424,We reviewed the latest national and provincial clinical guidelines, retrospective cohort studies, and case series regarding the treatment of COVID-19 by add-on Chinese medicine.
32166607,Treatment is essentially supportive; role of antiviral agents is yet to be established.
32167153,We thought that it is timely to explain the connection between the SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, ACE2 and the rationale for soluble ACE2 as a potential therapy.
32167524,Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, management, treatment, and outcome data were also collected and analyzed.
32167524,Among patients with ARDS, treatment with methylprednisolone decreased the risk of death (HR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.20-0.72).
32167524,Moreover, treatment with methylprednisolone may be beneficial for patients who develop ARDS.
32168162,The patient showed improvement both clinically and on computed tomography imaging at discharged after 2 weeks'treatment.
32169119,In this review, we summarized the latest research progress of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical characteristics of COVID-19, and discussed the current treatment and scientific advancements to combat the epidemic novel coronavirus.
32169481,These nine residues can be used to develop therapeutics specific against COVID-19.
32170865,The purpose of this review is primarily to review the pathogen, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19, but also to comment briefly on the epidemiology and pathology based on the current evidence.
32171076,Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors.
32171740,In the absence of a known efficient therapy and because of the situation of a public-health emergency, it made sense to investigate the possible effect of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine against SARS-CoV-2 since this molecule was previously described as a potent inhibitor of most coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-1.
32171740,Preliminary trials of chloroquine repurposing in the treatment of COVID-19 in China have been encouraging, leading to several new trials.
32171866,The Lopinavir and Ritonavir Tablets, Chinese medicine, oxygen therapy, and mechanical ventilation were statistically different in the elderly group and the young and middle-aged group, and the P values were all &lt;0.05.
32171869,Patients who were transferred to intensive care units (ICU) had significantly longer duration of fever as compared to those not in ICU (31 days v.s. 9 days after onset of symptoms, respectively, P &lt;0.0001).
32171869,The clinical progression pattern suggests that early control of viral replication and application of host-directed therapy in later stage is essential to improve the prognosis of CVOID-19.
32171872,We aimed to compare arbidol and lopinavir/ritonavir(LPV/r) treatment for patients with COVID-19 with LPV/r only.
32172226,Up to now, clinical features and treatment of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported in detail.
32172228,Overall, potential RT-PCR vulnerabilities include general preanalytical issues such as identification problems, inadequate procedures for collection, handling, transport and storage of the swabs, collection of inappropriate or inadequate material (for quality or volume), presence of interfering substances, manual errors, as well as specific aspects such as sample contamination and testing patients receiving antiretroviral therapy.
32172669,To standardize the diagnosis and treatment of this new infectious disease, an operational recommendation for the diagnosis and management of SARS-CoV-2 infection is developed by Peking Union Medical College Hospital.
32173110,As of this time, there is no known effective pharmaceutical treatment, although it is much needed for patient contracting the severe form of the disease.
32173110,The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the evidence regarding chloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19.
32173241,To date, effective treatment is lacking; however, clinical trials investigating the efficacy of several agents, including remdesivir and chloroquine, are underway in China.
32173576,Levels of potassium, albumin, lymphocyte were low, but increased persistently after treatment.
32173725,Refractory COVID-19 patients were more likely to receive oxygen, mechanical ventilation, expectorant, and adjunctive treatment including corticosteroid, antiviral drugs and immune enhancer (P&lt;0.05).
32174096,<b>Objective:</b> To explore the management strategies for patients with gynecological malignant tumors during the outbreak and transmission of COVID19. <b>Methods:</b> We retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics, treatment, and disease outcomes of three patients with gynecological malignancies associated with COVID19 in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University in January 2020, and proposed management strategies for patients with gynecological tumors under risk of COVID19. <b>Results:</b> Three patients were treated COVID19 based on the national diagnosis and treatment protocol as well as research progress.
32174096,Meanwhile, these patients were appropriately adjusted the treatment plan in accordance with the clinical guidelines for gynecological tumors.
32174096,Pneumonia was cured in 2 patients, and one patient died of COVID-19. <b>Conclusions:</b> Patients with gynecological malignant tumors are high-risk groups prone to COVID-19 infection, and gynecological oncologists need to carry out education, prevention, control and treatment according to specific conditions.
32174096,While actively preventing and controlling COVID-19, the diagnosis and treatment of gynecological malignant tumors should be carried out in an orderly and safe manner. <b>目的：</b> 在新型冠状病毒肺炎(COVID-19)暴发和传播期间，探讨妇科恶性肿瘤患者的管理策略。
32176772,Most patients received antiviral therapy (66 [98.5%] of 67 patients) and antibiotic therapy (66 [98.5%] of 67 patients).
32176772,Arbidol treatment showed tendency to improve the discharging rate and decrease the mortality rate.
32178593,These findings accentuate the unique features of COVID-19 and assist in the development of new therapeutics.
32178769,Intensive care units will then be at maximum capacity; up to 4000 hospital beds will be needed by mid-April, 2020.
32179150,This activity is conserved against SARS-Cov-2, thus placing teicoplanin as a potential treatment for patients with this virus.
32179788,Coronavirus, EBOV, ZIKV, IAV and measles), and also topically for the successful treatment of active lesions (e.g.

32180140,We should attach importance to early recognition, early diagnosis, and early treatment of infected children.
32180175,Three of the parturients are still recovering from their Cesarean delivery and are receiving in-hospital treatment for COVID-19.
32181903,In severe novel coronavirus pneumonia cases, the number of platelets, their dynamic changes during the treatment, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) were a concern.
32181903,Demographic, clinical, blood routine results, other laboratory results, and treatment data were collected and analyzed.
32181903,Univariate analysis showed that: age, platelet peaks, and PLR at peak platelet were the influencing factors in severe patients, multivariate analysis showed that the PLR value at peak platelet during treatment was an independent influencing factor in severe patients.
32181903,The average hospitalization day of patients with platelet peaks during treatment was longer than those without platelet peaks (P &lt; .05).
32181903,The average age of patients with platelet peaks during treatment was older than those without platelet peaks (P &lt; .05).
32181903,The patients with significantly elevated platelets during treatment had longer average hospitalization days.
32181903,And the higher PLR of patients during treatment had longer average hospitalization days.
32181903,Single-center case series of the 30 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Huizhou Municipal Central Hospital, presumed that the number of platelets and their dynamic changes during the treatment may have a suggestion on the severity and prognosis of the disease.
32181990,Following a treatment regimen consisting of reduced immunosuppressant use and low dose methylprednisolone-based therapy, the COVID-19 pneumonia in this long-term immunosuppressive patient was successfully recovered.
32181990,This effectively treated case has reference value for the future treatment of other transplant patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.
32183901,To date, no specific antiviral treatment has proven effective; hence, infected people primarily rely on symptomatic treatment and supportive care.
32185921,If the diagnosis and treatment of malaria cases as well as the investigation and response of the epidemic foci are not carried out timely, it may endanger patients'lives and cause the possible of secondary transmission, which threatens the achievements of malaria elimination in China.
32185921,Due to the extensive spread and high transmission ability of the COVID-19, there is a possibility of virus infections among malaria cases during the medical care-seeking behaviors and among healthcare professionals during clinical diagnosis and treatment, sample collection and testing and epidemiological surveys.
32186172,Close monitoring of oxygenation, reducing patients' oxygen consumption, active psychological intervention, and rapidly dealing with severe hypoxemia events are the key factors for the successful treatment of NIV.
32186172,In addition, active adjuvant therapy is also important, such as correcting coagulation dysfunction, providing proper nutritional support, accurate volume control, and safe individualized blood glucose monitoring and control.
32186277,Based on the experience from Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should increase their preparedness for a surge of patients with COVID-19 who will require healthcare, and in particular intensive care.
32186894,<b>OBJECTIVE.</b> The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical manifestations and CT features of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia in 15 pregnant women and to provide some initial evidence that can be used for guiding treatment of pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia. <b>MATERIALS AND METHODS.</b> We reviewed the clinical data and CT examinations of 15 consecutive pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia in our hospital from January 20, 2020, to February 10, 2020.
32186894,Symptoms and laboratory results were analyzed, treatment experiences were summarized, and clinical outcomes were tracked. <b>RESULTS.</b> Eleven patients had successful delivery (10 cesarean deliveries and one vaginal delivery) during the study period, and four patients were still pregnant (three in the second trimester and one in the third trimester) at the end of the study period.
32186952,However, to date, no licensed antiviral treatment or vaccine exists for MERS and SARS.
32186952,This article highlights ongoing advances in designing vaccines and therapeutics to counter COVID-19 while also focusing on such experiences and advances as made with earlier SARS- and MERS-CoVs, which together could enable efforts to halt this emerging virus infection.
32187464,No therapeutics have yet been proven effective for the treatment of severe illness caused by SARS-CoV-2.
32187464,Treatment with lopinavir-ritonavir was not associated with a difference from standard care in the time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio for clinical improvement, 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90 to 1.72).
32187464,Lopinavir-ritonavir treatment was stopped early in 13 patients (13.8%) because of adverse events.
32187464,In hospitalized adult patients with severe Covid-19, no benefit was observed with lopinavir-ritonavir treatment beyond standard care.
32187464,Future trials in patients with severe illness may help to confirm or exclude the possibility of a treatment benefit.
32187887,From the perspective of clinical pediatricians as the first line fighting the epidemic, this paper will discuss the clinical characteristics, prevention and control measures, outcomes, diagnosis, and treatment of pediatric cases.
32189175,Knowledge of CT characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia might be helpful to the early diagnosis and treatment of patients, and to control the spread of infection.
32190290,Here we highlight nine most important research questions concerning virus transmission, asymptomatic and presymptomatic virus shedding, diagnosis, treatment, vaccine development, origin of virus and viral pathogenesis.
32190904,Here we reported the screening, clinical feathers, and treatment process of a family cluster involving three COVID-19 patients.
32191691,Singapore adopted a multipronged surveillance strategy that included applying the case definition at medical consults, tracing contacts of patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, enhancing surveillance among different patient groups (all patients with pneumonia, hospitalized patients in intensive care units [ICUs] with possible infectious diseases, primary care patients with influenza-like illness, and deaths from possible infectious etiologies), and allowing clinician discretion (i.e., option to order a test based on clinical suspicion, even if the case definition was not met) to identify COVID-19 patients.
32191830,Severe forms of the infection, being an indication for treatment in the intensive care unit, comprise acute lung inflammation, ARDS, sepsis and septic shock.
32191830,The article presents basic information about etiology, pathogenesis and diagnostics (with particular emphasis on the importance of tomocomputer imaging), clinical picture, treatment and prevention of the infection.
32191830,Due to the fact that effective causal treatment is not yet available and the number of infections and deaths increases day by day, infection prevention and strict adherence to recommendations of infection control organizations remain the basis for fighting the virus.
32192278,These measures for early detection and screening of cases should be followed by full efforts to produce research-based evidence by thoroughly analyzing epidemiological, clinical and immunological data, which will facilitate the development of vaccines and therapeutics for COVID-19.
32192294,By summarizing the research progress and guidelines in recent years in the fields of colorectal cancer disease screening, treatment strategies (including early colorectal cancer, locally advanced colorectal cancer, obstructive colorectal cancer, metastatic colorectal cancer and the treatment of patients after neoadjuvant therapy), the choice of medication and time limit for adjuvant therapy, the protective measures for patients undergoing emergency surgery, the re-examination of postoperative patients and the protection of medical staff, etc., authors improve treatment strategies in order to provide more choices for patients to obtain the best treatment under the severe epidemic situation of new coronavirus pneumonia.
32192294,Meanwhile we hope that it can also provide more timely treatment modeling schemes for colleagues.
32192296,Although colorectal surgery is not a front-line subject in the fight against the epidemic, but in this special situation, it is a difficult task to provide the highest quality medical services and ensure the orderly clinical work, on the premise of maximizing the protection for patients and their families, health of medical staff, and the safety of wards and hospitals, We summarize how to carry out the clinical practice of colorectal surgery under the situation of the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemiology, including the procedures of diagnose and treatment for emergency patients with colorectal tumor, and share the experiences of the diagnosis of colorectal tumor, the management of patients with colorectal cancer who are scheduled to be admitted for surgery, the protection of wards, the perioperative management.
32192296,The main points are as follows: (1) Multidisciplinary team (MDT) must be run through the diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer.
32192297,The outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) makes the medical treatment of colorectal cancers difficult.
32192297,For metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) patients, maintenance therapy is the optimal choice.
32192297,Adjuvant chemotherapy should reduce the intensity of treatment and shorten the therapy time.
32193037,We analyzed the initial and follow-up CT features of patients with disease severity, according to the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia.
32193831,Treatment modalities were focused on symptomatic and respiratory support.
32193831,Up to February 24, 2020, three patients remained under treatment in ICU, the other five recovered and were discharged home.
32193905,In this report, we present mild clinical course of her pneumonia that did not require antiviral treatment and serial viral test results from multiple specimens.
32194034,It is more infectious and fatal than seasonal influenza, and definitive treatment and a vaccine are months away.
32194944,Among these, the antivirals ledipasvir or velpatasvir are particularly attractive as therapeutics to combat the new coronavirus with minimal side effects, commonly fatigue and headache.
32195698,Here, the authors review COVID-19 pathogenesis, presentation, diagnosis, and potential therapeutics, with a focus on management of COVID-19-associated respiratory failure.
32195698,The authors draw on literature from other viral epidemics, treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome, and recent publications on COVID-19, as well as guidelines from major health organizations.
32195704,So far, actions have been taken including but not limited to nationwide actions and online education regarding special procedures of airway management, oxygen therapy, ventilation support, hemodynamic management, sedation, and analgesia.
32195705,Timely, but not premature, intubation is crucial to counter a progressively enlarging oxygen debt despite high-flow oxygen therapy and bilevel positive airway pressure ventilation.
32196032,Identifying antibodies (Abs) that neutralize infectious agents is the first step for developing therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostic tools for these infectious agents.
32196083,There is an urgent need to identify safe and effective drugs for treatment.
32196410,Combined with the published literature, the potential pathogenesis of COVID-19 is inferred, and the treatment recommendations for giving high-doses intravenous immunoglobulin and low-molecular-weight heparin anticoagulant therapy to severe type patients are proposed.
32196707,All patients were given antiviral therapy (including oseltamivir), oxygen inhalation, and antibiotics.
32196707,One of the five patients had transient hemostatic medication for hemoptysis.
32197238,This Special Feature highlights the unique circumstances and challenges of cancer treatment amidst this global pandemic, and the importance of organizational structure, preparation, agility, and a shared vision for continuing to provide cancer treatment to patients in the face of uncertainty and rapid change.
32197787,There is not specific treatment for SARS-CoV-2, which is why the fundamental aspects are to establish adequate prevention measures and support treatment and management of complications.
32198776,Epidemiological, clinical features, laboratory findings, radiological characteristics, treatment, and clinical outcomes of 135 patients in northeast Chongqing were collected and analyzed in this study.
32198776,All patients received antiviral therapy (135 [100%]) (Kaletra and interferon were both used), antibacterial therapy (59 [43.7%]), and corticosteroids (36 [26.7%]).
32198776,Kaletra and TCM played an important role in the treatment of the viral pneumonia.
32198776,Further studies are required to explore the role of Kaletra and TCM in the treatment of COVID-19.
32201353,Based on the current published evidence, we systematically summarizes the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of knowledge surrounding COVID-19.
32202256,Hospitalized adult patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection with any one of the following criteria will be eligible to receive lopinavir/ritonavir for 14 days after obtaining written informed consent: (i) respiratory distress with respiratory rate ≥22/min or SpO2 of &lt;94 per cent; (ii) lung parenchymal infiltrates on chest X-ray; (iii) hypotension defined as systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg or need for vasopressor/inotropic medication; (iv) new-onset organ dysfunction; and (v) high-risk groups - age &gt;60 yr, diabetes mellitus, renal failure, chronic lung disease and immunocompromised persons.
32202256,Treatment outcomes amongst initial cases would be useful in providing guidance about the clinical management of patients with COVID-19.
32202343,Suggested treatment included providing oxygen, inhalations, nutritional support and maintaining fluids and electrolyte balances.
32202646,Frontline health care workers engaged in direct diagnosis, treatment, and care of patients with COVID-19 were associated with a higher risk of symptoms of depression (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.11-2.09; P = .01), anxiety (OR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.22-2.02; P &lt; .001), insomnia (OR, 2.97; 95% CI, 1.92-4.60; P &lt; .001), and distress (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.25-2.04; P &lt; .001).
32202646,In this survey of heath care workers in hospitals equipped with fever clinics or wards for patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan and other regions in China, participants reported experiencing psychological burden, especially nurses, women, those in Wuhan, and frontline health care workers directly engaged in the diagnosis, treatment, and care for patients with COVID-19.
32203189,The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has posed a serious threat to global public health, calling for the development of safe and effective prophylactics and therapeutics against infection of its causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), also known as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
32203711,Available evidence from similar patient populations suggests that carefully selected patients with severe ARDS who do not benefit from conventional treatment might be successfully supported with venovenous ECMO.
32204411,It may provide references for policy makers to plan and fight against COVID-19 effectively by improving stability of popular feelings and urgently prepare clinical practitioners to deliver corresponding therapy foundations for the risk groups and affected people.
32204750,With the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and growing knowledge of its diagnosis and treatment, it has been clear that children are also susceptible to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
32204751,At present there is limited clinical information of the SARS-CoV-2 and there is no specific treatment recommended, although technical guidances and suggestions have been developed and will continue to be updated as additional information becomes available.
32204751,Preventive treatment has an important role to control and avoid the spread of severe respiratory disease, but often is difficult to obtain and sometimes cannot be effective to reduce the risk of deterioration of the underlining lung pathology.
32204751,In order to define an effective and safe treatment for SARS-CoV-2-associated disease, we provide considerations on the actual treatments, on how to avoid complications and the undesirable side effects related to them and to select and apply earlier the most appropriate treatment.
32204751,The final outcome is strictly connected with the ability to apply an appropriate treatment early and to reduce all the complications that can arise during the intensive care admission.
32204755,After two weeks of treatment, the patient recovered gradually and was discharged.
32204757,This article reports the diagnosis and treatment of twin girls who were diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in Hunan Province, China.
32204757,Both recovered after symptomatic treatment.
32204758,Newborns with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should be transferred to designated hospitals for isolation treatment.
32205092,Development of effective prevention and treatment is an urgent need.
32205186,Given the lack of specific anti-viral therapies, the current management of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2) is mainly supportive, even though several compounds are now under investigation for the treatment of this life-threatening disease.
32205186,COVID-19 pandemic is certainly conditioning the treatment strategy of a complex disorder as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), whose infectious risk is increased compared to the general population because of an overall impairment of immune system typical of autoimmune diseases combined with the iatrogenic effect generated by corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs.
32205186,However, the increasing knowledge about the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection is leading to consider some anti-rheumatic drugs as potential treatment options for the management of COVID-19.
32205204,Depending on their clinical presentation, azithromycin was added to the treatment.
32205204,Despite its small sample size our survey shows that hydroxychloroquine treatment is significantly associated with viral load reduction/disappearance in COVID-19 patients and its effect is reinforced by azithromycin.
32205232,Furthermore, LH treatment resulted in abnormal particle morphology of virion in cells.
32205349,Scientists are racing towards the development of treatment for COVID-19.
32207032,However, children less than 3 years old accounted for majority cases and critical cases lied in this age group, which demanded extra attentions during home caring and hospitalization treatment.
32207377,Due to its high pathogenicity and infectivity and the lack of effective vaccines and therapeutics, live SARS-CoV-2 has to be handled under biosafety level 3 conditions, which has hindered the development of vaccines and therapeutics.
32207377,When tested against the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, SARS-CoV-2 convalescent patient sera showed high neutralizing potency, which underscore its potential as therapeutics.
32207377,Taken together, we established a robust pseudovirus-based neutralization assay for SARS-CoV-2 and are glad to share pseudoviruses and related protocols with the developers of vaccines or therapeutics to fight against this lethal virus.
32207591,A total of 67 patients diagnosed as COVID-19 by nucleic acid testing were included and divided into 4 groups according to the clinical staging based on <i>Diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia (Trial version 6)</i>.
32208494,Due to the current development around the COVID-19 pandemic, palliative ch has created a Task Force to provide recommendations for health professionals on the treatment of palliative care patients in the various settings ‒ inpatient and outpatient.
32208840,Furthermore, he observes the significant abnormality of coagulation function and proposes that the early intravenous immunoglobulin and low molecular weight heparin anticoagulation therapy are very important.
32208840,For severe or critically ill patients, in addition to the respiratory supportive treatment, timely multiorgan evaluation and treatment is very crucial.
32208987,Because the ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) protein is the receptor that facilitates coronavirus entry into cells, the notion has been popularized that treatment with renin-angiotensin system blockers might increase the risk of developing a severe and fatal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection.
32208987,In summary, based on the currently available evidence, treatment with renin-angiotensin system blockers should not be discontinued because of concerns with coronavirus infection.
32209890,C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were also significantly higher in the death group on admission (109.25 [35.00, 170.28] mg/L vs.3.22 [1.04, 21.80] mg/L, Z = 10.206, P &lt; 0.001) showed no significant improvement after treatment (109.25 [35.0, 170.28] mg/L vs.
32210741,Altogether, the results presented in this work contribute to gain a deep understanding of the molecular pharmacology of SARS-CoV-2 treatment and validate the use of protease inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2.
32211816,Clinical laboratory, radiological, and treatment data were collected and analyzed.
32211844,Epidemiological, clinical and treatment data were analyzed between those older (≥60y) and younger (&lt;60y) patients.
32211963,We retrospectively reviewed the initial chest CT data of 62 confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 patients (34 men, 28 women; age range 20-91 years old) who did not receive any antiviral treatment between January 21 and February 4, 2020, in Chongqing, China.
32212378,This commentary seeks to share some key insights relevant to optimizing COVID-19 candidate therapeutics that were learned from attempts to optimize anti-infective posology in settings where quality and timely availability of data is challenging, with particular focus on influenza, including experiences from H5N1 and pH1N1 outbreaks.
32212779,Cancer patients are more susceptible to coronavirus infection than individuals without cancer as they are in an immunosuppressive state because of the malignancy and anticancer treatment.
32213260,Available animal and cell line models have suggested that specific therapeutics might be effective in treating Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).
32213260,We conducted a systematic review of evidence for treatment with pharmacologic and supportive therapies.
32213260,We developed a protocol and searched 5 databases for studies describing treatment of MERS and deaths in MERS patients.
32213260,One study, at moderate RoB, showed reduced mortality rates in severe MERS patients with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; no other studies showed a significant lifesaving benefit to any treatment.
32213260,Clinical trials are needed to guide treatment decisions.
32213700,The COVID-19 virus is severely testing the Italian healthcare system, as the requests for intensive treatment are greater than the real capacity of the system to receive patients.
32214286,The World Health Organization (WHO) and multiple agencies led by the CDC in the United States have attempted to organize intensive outbreak investigation programs utilizing appropriate preventive measures, evaluation, and treatment.
32214286,These include vaccines, medications Remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine and potentially combination therapy.
32214286,Thus, at this point, the avoidance of the cytokine storm may be the key for the treatment of HCOV-19 infected patients.In China, where there was limited availability of effective modalities to manage COVID-19 several patients were treated with expanded UC-MSCs.
32214286,In this manuscript, we describe the urgent need for various solutions, pathogenesis of coronavirus and the clinical evidence for treatment of COVID-19 with stem cells.
32215622,Besides satisfying the Koch's postulates, this readily available hamster model is an important tool for studying transmission, pathogenesis, treatment, and vaccination against SARS-CoV-2.
32216114,These results provide a foundation for understanding the molecular basis of coronaviral PLPs' catalytic mechanism and for the screening and design of therapeutics to combat infection by SADS coronavirus.
32216248,Additionally, they constitute a closed conglomerate since they come to treatment regularly, spending hours in the treatment places, exposed to a possible acquisition of the infection.
32216248,Finally, going to their treatment regularly prevents them from remaining in home isolation and with potential exposure.
32216653,Outbreaks of infectious etiology, particularly those caused by a novel virus that has no known treatment or vaccine, may result in the interruption of medical care provided to patients with cancer and put them at risk for undertreatment in addition to the risk of being exposed to infection, a life-threatening event among patients with cancer.
32216653,This article describes the approach used to manage patients with cancer during a large-scale Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus hospital outbreak in Saudi Arabia to ensure continuity of care and minimize harm from treatment interruption or acquiring infection.
32217113,We discuss the latest options in antiviral therapy and vaccine development, including the novel use of chloroquine in the management of COVID-19.
32217834,Overall, this study characterized the cytokine storm in severe COVID-19 and provides insights into immune therapeutics and vaccine design.
32218301,The herein-investigated benzimidazole-based derivatives may represent valuable hit compounds, deserving subsequent structural improvements towards more efficient antiviral agents for the treatment of pathologies caused by these human respiratory viruses.
32218340,At the present, there is no single specific vaccine or efficient antiviral therapy against COVID-19.
32218340,Recently, we showed that intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) treatment reduces inflammation of intestinal epithelial cells and eliminates overgrowth of the opportunistic human fungal pathogen <i>Candida albicans</i> in the murine gut.
32218340,Different procedures may be used to remove or inactivate any possible pathogens from the plasma of recovered coronavirus patient derived immune IgG, including solvent/detergent, 60 °C heat-treatment, and nanofiltration.
32218340,Overall, immunotherapy with immune IgG antibodies combined with antiviral drugs may be an alternative treatment against COVID-19 until stronger options such as vaccines are available.
32219356,During hospitalization, patients with elevated TnT levels had more frequent malignant arrhythmias, and the use of glucocorticoid therapy (37 [71.2%] vs 69 [51.1%]) and mechanical ventilation (41 [59.6%] vs 14 [10.4%]) were higher compared with patients with normal TnT levels.
32219356,Aggressive treatment may be considered for patients at high risk of myocardial injury.
32219357,She was treated with dobutamine, antiviral drugs (lopinavir/ritonavir), steroids, chloroquine, and medical treatment for heart failure, with progressive clinical and instrumental stabilization.
32219428,To determine whether convalescent plasma transfusion may be beneficial in the treatment of critically ill patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.
32219428,Case series of 5 critically ill patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) who met the following criteria: severe pneumonia with rapid progression and continuously high viral load despite antiviral treatment; Pao2/Fio2 &lt;300; and mechanical ventilation.
32219428,All 5 patients (age range, 36-65 years; 2 women) were receiving mechanical ventilation at the time of treatment and all had received antiviral agents and methylprednisolone.
32219428,ARDS resolved in 4 patients at 12 days after transfusion, and 3 patients were weaned from mechanical ventilation within 2 weeks of treatment.
32219428,The limited sample size and study design preclude a definitive statement about the potential effectiveness of this treatment, and these observations require evaluation in clinical trials.
32219626,Based on the New Diagnosis and Treatment Scheme for Novel Coronavirus Infected Pneumonia (Trial Edition 5), combined with our current clinical treatment experience, we recently proposed a revision of the first edition of &quot;Guidance for maternal and fetal management during pneumonia epidemics of novel coronavirus infection in the Wuhan Tongji Hospital&quot;.
32219626,This article focused on the issues of greatest concern of pregnant women including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection diagnostic criteria, inspection precautions, drug treatment options, indications and methods of termination of pregnancy, postpartum fever, breastfeeding considerations, mode of mother-to-child transmission, neonatal isolation and advice on neonatal nursing, to provide valuable experience for better management of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant women and newborns.
32219627,Based on the treatment of severe patients in Wuhan, combined with the treatment practice in Tongji Hospital affiliated to Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, this paper puts forward the urgency of further strengthening the construction of public hospitals, discusses the feasible path for promoting the development of public hospitals, so as to meet the growing medical needs of the people, improve the ability to respond to major public health emergencies, and effectively guarantee the safety of people's lives and the promotion of a healthy China construction.
32219814,In view of the seriousness of the COVID-19 epidemic, a series of prevention and control measures adopted by the government have restricted the follow-up, diagnosis and treatment of patients by the hospitals, which has a great impact on their mental and physical health.
32219882,In the absence of specific treatment for this virus, there is an urgent need to learn from the experience and lessons in China.
32219882,To help understand the advantages and limitations of differential treatments, we provide a timely review and discuss the complications and corresponding major treatments, especially controversial ones such as antiviral therapy (remdesivir, ribavirin, and chloroquine), glucocorticoid therapy, extracorporeal support including an artificial liver system, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation based on available evidence.
32219882,As a result, we suggest that antiviral therapy and organ function support are vital to reduce mortality for mild patients and critical patients, respectively.
32219885,We also found that the RT-PCR results from several tests at different points were variable from the same patients during the course of diagnosis and treatment of these patients.
32219885,Our results indicate that in addition to the emphasis on RT-PCR testing, clinical indicators such as computed tomography images should also be used not only for diagnosis and treatment but also for isolation, recovery/discharge, and transferring for hospitalized patients clinically diagnosed with COVID-19 during the current epidemic.
32219995,Efficient obstetric treatment is required, and is key to optimizing the prognosis for both mother and child.
32220033,Patients in the mild group experienced earlier initiation of antiviral treatment (1.19 ± 0.45 vs 2.65 ± 1.06 days in the severe group, P &lt; 0.001).
32220033,It is recommended that timely antiviral treatment should be initiated to slow the disease progression and improve the prognosis.
32220112,Anticoagulant therapy mainly with LMWH appears to be associated with better prognosis in severe COVID-19 patients meeting SIC criteria or with markedly elevated D-dimer.
32220177,This review summarizes the ongoing researches regarding etiology, epidemiology, transmission dynamics, treatment, and prevention and control strategies of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with comparison to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and pandemic H1N1 virus.
32220177,Meanwhile, rapid detection kit for serological monitoring of the virus in general population is expected so as to achieve early detection, early diagnosis, early isolation and early treatment.
32220178,As biological products have broadly applied in the prevention and treatment of severe epidemic diseases, they are promising in blocking novel coronavirus infection.
32220178,According to the research advances of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), we reviewed the potential application of biological products such as interferon, convalescent plasma, intestinal micro-ecological regulators, vaccines and therapeutic antibodies, etc. , on prevention and treatment of COVID-19.
32220179,Based on the higher mortality and the higher proportion of critically ill adults in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with diabetes, good inpatient glycemic control is particularly important in the comprehensive treatment of COVID-19.
32220179,Individualized blood glucose target goals and treatment strategies should be made according to specific circumstances of COVID-19 inpatients with diabetes.
32220179,For mild patients, a strict glycemic control target (fasting plasma glucose (FPG) 4.4-6.1 mmol/L, 2-hour postprandial plasma glucose (2 h PG) 6.1-7.8 mmol/L) are recommended; a target for the glycemic control of common type patients (FPG 6.1-7.8 mmol/L, 2 h PG 7.8-10.0 mmol/L) and subcutaneous insulin deliver therapy are recommended; a target nonfasting blood glucose range of 10.0 mmol or less per liter for severe-type COVID-19 patients, a relatively Less stringent blood glucose control target (FPG 7.8-10.0 mmol/L, 2 h PG 7.8-13.9 mmol/L) for critically ill patients and intravenous insulin infusion therapy are recommended.
32220179,Due to the rapid changes in the condition of some patients, the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar status (HHS) maybe occur during the treatment.
32220276,D-dimer and FDP levels increased progressively when COVID-2019 exacerbated, and 4 patients were diagnosed with definite disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). 6 patients received low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) treatment, after which their D-dimer and FDP decreased, but there was no significant improvement in clinical symptoms. 5 patients died finally and the median time from acro-ischemia to death was 12 days. <b>Conclusions:</b> The existence of hypercoagulation status in critical COVID-2019 patients should be monitored closely, and anticoagulation therapy can be considered in selected patients.
32220276,More clinical data is needed to investigate the role of anticoagulation in COVID-2019 treatment. <b>目的：</b> 总结合并肢端缺血的新型冠状病毒肺炎（COVID-19）患者的临床和凝血参数特征。
32221523,The widely used reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) method has limitations for clinical diagnosis and treatment.
32221973,In particular, we describe key elements of clinical management, including: safe oxygen therapy; airway management; personal protective equipment; and non-technical aspects of caring for patients diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019.
32221983,Because of these protective effects of ACE2 on chronic underlying diseases and ARDS, the development of spike protein-based vaccine and drugs enhancing ACE2 activity may become one of the most promising approaches for the treatment of COVID-19 in the future.
32222119,The aim is to evaluate pregnant women infected with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and provide help for clinical prevention and treatment.
32222121,To explore the feasibility of surgical treatment for cancer patients complicated with corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32222121,The inflammation indicators and fever of this patient were effectively controlled and the lung lesions remained stable after active anti-viral treatment, then the radical colorectomy was performed after the viral negative conversion for twice.
32222466,Here, from the perspective of clinical immunologists, we will discuss the clinical and immunological characteristics of severe patients, and summarize the current evidence and share our experience in anti-inflammation treatment, including glucocorticoids, IL-6 antagonist, JAK inhibitors and choloroquine/hydrocholoroquine, of patients with severe COVID-19 that may have an impaired immune system.
32222703,COVID-19 patients with ESKD need isolation dialysis, but most of them cannot be handled in time due to limited continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) machines.
32222720,Practical work experience in our spinal outpatient and emergency department during the COVID-19 pandemic is summarized in this article, with combined evidence-based medical evidence to explore a standardized process of diagnosis and treatment for spinal diseases.
32222720,Spine surgeons should collaborate with infection control specialists to avoid cross-infection in hospitals and optimize treatment.
32222812,The topics were: (1) infection control, (2) laboratory diagnosis and specimens, (3) hemodynamic support, (4) ventilatory support, and (5) COVID-19 therapy.
32222992,All of these three cases experienced mild illness and recovered soon after the treatment, with the nucleic acid of throat swab turning negative within 14, 11, and 7 days after diagnosis, respectively.
32223003,This also applies to AD patients on systemic immune-modulating treatment.
32223003,In these days of uncertainty, reallocation of medical resources, curfew, hoarding, and shutdown of normal social life, patients, caregivers and doctors ask questions regarding the continuation of systemic immune-modulating treatment of AD patients.
32223012,We compared clinical features between patients not requiring admission for clinical reasons or antimicrobials with those assessed as needing either admission or antimicrobial treatment.
32223665,<b>OBJECTIVE.</b> This study aims to assess correlations of the time from symptom onset to diagnosis and treatment with the time to disease resolution and CT scores as based on findings from sequential chest CT examinations. <b>MATERIALS AND METHODS.</b> Thirty patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis underwent chest CT examinations.
32223665,The time from symptom onset to diagnosis and treatment was recorded for each patient, and on the basis of this information, patients with COVID-19 were divided into group 1 (patients for whom this interval was ≤ 3 days) and group 2 (those for whom this interval was &gt; 3 days).
32223665,The CT scores for each group were fitted using a Lorentzian line-shape curve to show the variation tendency during treatment.
32223665,The differences in age, sex, and last CT scores determined before discharge between the two groups were analyzed, and correlations of the time from symptom onset to diagnosis and treatment with the time to disease resolution as well as with the highest CT score also underwent statistical analysis. <b>RESULTS.</b> A total of 25 subjects were enrolled in the study.
32223665,The time from symptom onset to diagnosis and treatment had a positive correlation with the time to disease resolution (<i>r</i> = 0.93; <i>p</i> = 0.000) as well as with the highest CT score (<i>r</i> = 0.83; <i>p</i> = 0.006). <b>CONCLUSION.</b> Timely diagnosis and treatment are key to providing a better prognosis for patients with COVID-19.
32223840,<b>Objective:</b> To collect the current status and healthcare needs of people living with HIV (PLHIV) in China during the COVID-19 outbreak to inform quick response from government and communities. <b>Methods:</b> During February 5(th) to 10(th) , 2020, a national anonymous survey was conducted using an online questionnaire among PLHIV at least 18 years of age and had started antiretroviral treatment (ART) to collect the information on COVID-19 prevention, HIV-related health services and the needs on psychosocial support.
32224151,If the last anti-tumour treatment was within 14 days, it significantly increased the risk of developing severe events (HR=4.079, 95%CI 1.086-15.322, P=0.037).
32224769,The topics were: 1) infection control, 2) laboratory diagnosis and specimens, 3) hemodynamic support, 4) ventilatory support, and 5) COVID-19 therapy.
32226003,Thanks to the collaboration of experts worldwide, more information about this virus and its infection is reported each day, which allows modifying the recommendations for its prevention and treatment, without forgetting that the ultimate goal is to control this epidemic.
32226287,Four patients required oxygen therapy but none of them needed machinal ventilation.
32226288,No specific anti-virus drugs or vaccines are available for the treatment of this sudden and lethal disease.
32226288,The supportive care and non-specific treatment to ameliorate the symptoms of the patient are the only options currently.
32226288,At the top of these conventional therapies, greater than 85% of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients in China are receiving Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) treatment.
32226288,In this article, relevant published literatures are thoroughly reviewed and current applications of TCM in the treatment of COVID-19 patients are analyzed.
32226288,Due to the homology in epidemiology, genomics, and pathogenesis of the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, and the widely use of TCM in the treatment of SARS-CoV, the clinical evidence showing the beneficial effect of TCM in the treatment of patients with SARS coronaviral infections are discussed.
32226289,Therapeutic neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against SARS-CoV-2 will be greatly important therapeutic agents for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32226290,Such knowledge will provide important clues for control of the ongoing epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 infection and treatment of COVID-19.
32226295,We will cover the basics about the epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and prevention of the disease.
32226695,Following this potential treatment options emerge.
32226695,Other therapeutics to consider that are also directed towards decreased pulmonary pressure include Nifedipine and Phosphodiesterase inhibitors.
32226695,The utilization of medications found to be effective in HAPE, for the treatment of COVID-19, is proposed.
32227090,The finding of this study explains the high rate of severe cases among COVID-19 patients with basic cardiovascular disease; and these results also perhaps provide important reference to clinical treatment of cardiac injury among severe patients infected by SARS-CoV-2.
32227123,The levels of peripheral lymphocyte subsets were measured by flow cytometry in 60 hospitalized COVID-19 patients before and after treatment, and their association with clinical characteristics and treatment efficacy was analyzed.
32227123,After treatment, 37 patients (67%) reached clinical response, with an increase of CD8+ T cells and B cells.
32227123,In multivariate analysis, post-treatment decrease of CD8+ T cells and B cells and increase of CD4+/CD8+ ratio were indicated as independent predictors for poor efficacy.
32227123,Peripheral lymphocyte subset alteration was associated with the clinical characteristics and treatment efficacy of COVID-19.
32227123,CD8+ T cells tended to be an independent predictor for COVID-19 severity and treatment efficacy.
32227274,Information on clinical signs and symptoms, medical treatment, virus clearance, and laboratory parameters including interleukin 6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein were collected.
32227274,Therapeutic regimens of IFN-α + lopinavir/ritonavir and IFN-α + lopinavir/ritonavir + ribavirin might be beneficial for treatment of COVID-19.
32227274,Serum LDH or CK decline may predict a favorable response to treatment of COVID-19 infection.
32227357,There is no specific treatment available and management is empirical.
32227493,Confronting the challenge of the outbreak of COVID-19 should sharpen our focus on global drug access as a key issue in antiviral therapy testing.
32227493,The apparent COVID-19 pandemic provides an opportunity to follow dosage guidelines for treatment with ribavirin, test new therapeutic concepts, and conduct controlled testing to apply the scientific rigor required to address the controversy around this mainstay of antiviral therapy.
32227596,To outline strategies for the treatment of migraine which do not require in-person visits to clinic or the emergency department, and to describe ways that health insurance companies can remove barriers to quality care for migraine.
32227596,We focus on evidence-based treatment where possible, but also describe &quot;real world&quot; strategies which may be tried.
32227609,The COVID-19 outbreak in Italy is stopping access to elective benign disease treatment and changing the approach to malignant disease as well as the outpatients care of those patients treated for colorectal cancer.
32227758,During the first 3 weeks of the Covid-19 outbreak in the Seattle area, the most common reasons for admission to the ICU were hypoxemic respiratory failure leading to mechanical ventilation, hypotension requiring vasopressor treatment, or both.
32228222,We observed that patients receiving ACEI or ARB therapy had a lower rate of severe diseases and a trend toward a lower level of IL-6 in peripheral blood.
32228222,In addition, ACEI or ARB therapy increased CD3 and CD8 T cell counts in peripheral blood and decreased the peak viral load compared to other antihypertensive drugs.
32228226,The transcriptome dataset of COVID-19 patients would be a valuable resource for clinical guidance on anti-inflammatory medication and understanding the molecular mechansims of host response.
32228252,In lieu of the fact that many older patients with hypertension or other CVDs are routinely treated with RAAS blockers and statins, new clinical concerns have developed regarding whether these patients are at greater risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection, whether RAAS and statin therapy should be discontinued, and the potential consequences of RAAS blockade to COVID-19-related pathologies such as acute and chronic respiratory disease.
32228809,These findings might also serve as a practical reference for clinical diagnosis and medical treatment.
32228825,Therefore, drugs that suppress IL-1 or IL-1R, also used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis are to be taken into consideration to treat COVID-19.
32228827,Finally, the apparently accurate treatment prediction platform (EpiMed) independently developed by the team was used to predict the therapeutic drug. <b>Results:</b> The GSE59185 coronavirus data set was searched and screened in the GEO database, and divided into wt group, ΔE group, Δ3 group, Δ5 group according to different subtypes, and compared with control group.
32228827,The drugs predicted by EpiMed's apparent precision treatment prediction platform for disease-drug association analysis are mainly TNF-α inhibitors, resveratrol, ritonavir, paeony, retinoic acid, forsythia, and houttuynia cordata. <b>Conclusions:</b> The abnormal activation of multiple inflammatory pathways may be the cause of heart failure in patients after coronavirus infection.
32229257,The objective of this study is to investigate the short-term effect of risk-adapted treatment strategy on patients with COVID-19.
32229257,We divided these patients into mild, moderate and severe groups, and risk-adapted treatment approaches were given according to the illness severity.
32229257,Risk-adapted treatment strategy was associated with significant clinical manifestations alleviation and clinical imaging recovery.
32229706,Similarly, two proposed therapeutics for the treatment of COVID-19 infection are Azithromycin and Quercetin, both drugs with significant senolytic activity.
32229706,Therefore, we wish to speculate that the fight against COVID-19 disease should involve testing the hypothesis that senolytics and other anti-aging drugs may have a prominent role in preventing the transmission of the virus, as well as aid in its treatment.
32229706,Thus, we propose that new clinical trials may be warranted, as several senolytic and anti-aging therapeutics are existing FDA-approved drugs, with excellent safety profiles, and would be readily available for drug repurposing efforts.
32229706,As Azithromycin and Doxycycline are both commonly used antibiotics that inhibit viral replication and IL-6 production, we may want to consider this general class of antibiotics that functionally inhibits cellular protein synthesis as a side-effect, for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 disease.
32229732,The recorded information includes demographic data, medical history, contact history, potential comorbidities, symptoms, signs, laboratory test results, chest computer tomography scans, and treatment measures.
32229732,In addition, 5 patients with CKD who were undergone regular continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) before admission were confirmed infection of SARS-CoV-2 and diagnosed as COVID-19.
32229732,In addition to therapy for COVID-19, CRRT was also applied 3 times weekly during hospitalization for these 5 patients with CKD.
32229732,In the course of treatment, the renal function indicators showed stable state in all 5 patients with CKD, without exacerbation of CKD, and pulmonary inflammation was gradually absorbed.
32230900,Scientific advancements since the pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002~2003 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012 have accelerated our understanding of the epidemiology and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and the development of therapeutics to treat viral infection.
32230900,As no specific therapeutics and vaccines are available for disease control, the epidemic of COVID-19 is posing a great threat for global public health.
32231345,To develop specific anti-coronavirus therapeutics and prophylactics, the molecular mechanism that underlies viral infection must first be defined.
32231345,Intranasal application of EK1C4 before or after challenge with HCoV-OC43 protected mice from infection, suggesting that EK1C4 could be used for prevention and treatment of infection by the currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 and other emerging SARSr-CoVs.
32231348,WHO has accelerated research in diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics for this novel coronavirus.
32232214,There is still no vaccine or definitive treatment for this virus because its pathogenesis and proliferation pathways are still unknown.
32232230,As one of the busiest specialised hospitals in the world, the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery of Peking University School and Hospital of Stomatology summarised the experience with disease prevention and control and clinical recommendations on the examination, diagnosis and treatment processes, clinical management, healthcare personnel protection and disinfection amid the continued spread of the pandemic.
32232423,The most common procedures related to the examination and treatment of upper aerodigestive tract diseases were reviewed.
32232432,This paper discusses proposed changes to privacy regulations such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability act (HIPAA) designed to let health information seamlessly and frictionlessly flow between the health entities that need to collaborate on treatment of patients and, also, allow it to flow to researchers trying to understand how to limit its impacts.
32232433,During the period of treatment, the ocular signs and symptoms as well as results of blood tests and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from nasopharyngeal and conjunctival swabs for SARS-CoV-2 were noted and analyzed.
32232685,Most of the critically ill patients received high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen therapy.
32232685,Among them, 27 (8.4%) patients experienced severe acute respiratory failure including 17 patients (63%) treated with HFNC as first-line therapy, 9 patients (33%) treated with noninvasive ventilation (NIV) and one patient (4%) treated with invasive ventilation.
32232685,HFNC failure was defined by the need of NIV or intubation as rescue therapy.
32232685,After initiation of NIV as rescue therapy among the 7 patients with HFNC failure, PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> significantly improved after 1-2 h of NIV [median 172 (150-208) mmHg vs.
32232685,However, two out of seven (29%) patients with NIV as rescue therapy ultimately received intubation.
32233013,Demographic data, medical history, symptoms and signs, laboratory findings, chest computed tomography (CT) as well the treatment measures were collected and analysed.
32233018,Targeting the overexpression of Il-6 effects with a monoclonal antibody against IL-6 receptor or using Janus Kinase inhibitors may be particularly helpful for treatment of Covid-19 pneumonia in diabetes.
32233064,It is prudent to stop non-cancer procedures and prioritize urgent cancer treatment.
32233561,The absence of specific therapeutic treatment or effective vaccine against COVID-19 call for other avenues of the prevention and control measures.
32233563,More rigorous prevention measures and better treatment of patients are needed to control its further spread, e.g., increasing available hospital beds, shortening the period from symptom onset to isolation of patients, quarantining and isolating the suspected cases as well as all confirmed patients.
32233641,Currently, no effective medical treatment exists to combat this disease.
32233641,Traditional Chinese herbal medicines (CHM) have unique roles in the treatment of viral infections.
32233642,All the patients received standardized treatment.
32233816,Antibiotic and antiviral treatment was initiated.
32233973,<i>Satisfactory outcome was observed in one mild case and one severe case of COVID-19 pneumonia after the use of the online/offline multidisciplinary quarantine observation form, online monitoring, and classified diagnosis and treatment, as well as strict compliance with quarantine measures.
32233973,The multidisciplinary self-quarantine model provides early judgment, identification, and treatment of disease, improves compliance with early rehabilitation, increases confidence in recovery, and enhances self-management capabilities.
32233973,The application of this new management model is worthy of being promoted in our specialized treatment facilities and in countries with severe epidemics.</i>
32234126,The current etiological test of COVID-19 cost long time, and have high false negative rate, may resulting delay the measures of disease treatment and prevention.
32234131,After 3 to 5 days of treatment, 2019-nCoV nucleic acid in a second respiratory sample turned negative in 6 cases.
32234465,Here we scrutinise a series of available studies by global scientists on the clinical manifestations, detection methods and treatment options for the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and also propose potential strategies for preventing the infection.
32234466,Intensive research on the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 is urgently needed to elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms and epidemiological characteristics and to identify potential drug targets, which will contribute to the development of effective prevention and treatment strategies.
32234467,Therefore, the treatment of cytokine storm has become an important part of rescuing severe patients.
32234467,If it can block the signal transduction pathway of IL-6, it is expected to become a new method for the treatment of severe patients.
32234468,In addition, registered trials investigating treatment options for COVID-19 infection are listed.
32235161,A third survey collected current practice of PIBD treatment.
32235161,Eight PIBD children had COVID-19 globally, all with mild infection without needing hospitalization despite treatment with immunomodulators and/or biologics.
32235161,No cases have been reported in China and South Korea but biologic treatment has been delayed in 79 children, of whom 17 (22%) had exacerbation of their IBD.
32235161,Among the Porto group members, face-to-face appointments were often replaced by remote consultations but almost all did not change current IBD treatment.
32235486,Data on treatment options were limited.
32235575,Although no vaccines have been discovered yet, a series of containment measures have been implemented by various governments, especially in China, in the effort to prevent further outbreak, whilst various medical treatment approaches have been used to successfully treat infected patients.
32235575,On the basis of current studies, it would appear that the combined antiviral treatment has shown the highest success rate.
32235575,This review aims to critically summarize the most recent advances in understanding the coronavirus, as well as the strategies in prevention and treatment.
32236089,The entire healthcare system had to respond promptly in a very short time to an exponential growth of the number of subjects affected by COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) with the need of semi-intensive and intensive care units.
32236624,In the present review, we address current knowledge on coronaviruses from a short history to epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestation of the disease, as well as treatment and prevention strategies.
32236983,As yet, effective treatment is unavailable.
32236983,However, the results of preliminary studies and clinical trials are improving our understanding of the pathogenesis and treatment of Covid-19.
32237160,Chinese medical staff have summarized a set of effective strategies and methods in the diagnosis and treatment of this disease that are worthy of reference for their international counterparts.
32237206,Furthermore, the rising prevalence of obesity in the US and prior experience of the impact of obesity on mortality from H<sub>1</sub> N<sub>1</sub> Influenza should increase the sensitivity of clinicians caring for patients with obesity and COVID-19 to the need for aggressive treatment of such patients.
32237998,It is unknown if dermatologists are assisting with the public health officials' recommendations for social distancing by closing their practice or limiting their practice to the treatment of emergency conditions.
32238232,Thus, treatment approaches should include antiviral and anti-proinflammatory cytokines, anti-infectious and life support therapies, especially in patients with severe diseases.
32238260,Thus leading to a delay in the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection and further spread of the virus, since in most cases of Dengue there are no warning signs and treatment is ambulatory.
32238504,Neurologists are used to uncertainty - diagnoses are frequently challenging, too often there are limited treatment options, and unpredictable prognoses are our bread and butter.
32238613,It is important to recognize the risk factors, categorize severity and provide early treatment.
32238757,Currently, various diagnostic kits to test for COVID-19 are available and several repurposing therapeutics for COVID-19 have shown to be clinically effective.
32238757,Here, we review the current status of epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, and vaccine development for COVID-19.
32239127,Epidemiological, clinical, radiological characteristics, underlying diseases, laboratory tests treatment, complications and outcomes data were collected.
32239127,There was no difference in drug treatment rates between the survival and non-survival groups.
32239127,There were no differences in mortality among those who did or did not receive antimicrobial or glucocorticoid drug treatment.
32239142,Since the preclinical or clinical information of these identified drugs is already available, they might be ready for being clinically tested in the treatment of COVID-19.
32239799,Coagulopathy in corona virus infection has been shown to be associated with high mortality with high D-dimers being a particularly important marker for the coagulopathy.<sup>1</sup> In the latest paper from the same group, the use of anticoagulant therapy with heparin was shown to decrease mortality as well. <sup>2</sup> This is especially so in patients i) who have met the sepsis induced coagulopathy (SIC) criteria ≥4 (40.0% vs 64.2%, P=0.029) compared to those with SIC score &lt;4 (29.0% vs 22.6%, P=0.419).or ii) with markedly elevated D-dimer (greater than six-fold at the upper limit of normal).
32240303,Emergent policy changes related to telemedicine and the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) during the novel coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) have created opportunities for technology-based clinical evaluation, which serves to conserve personal protective equipment (PPE) and protect emergency providers.
32240462,Apart from supportive care, no specific treatment has been established for COVID-19.
32240567,While in our centre we did not change our approach to the treatment of our young cancer patients, we developed a qualitative survey to assess their perception of the risk and level of stress.
32240670,Close monitoring and timely treatment should be performed for the elderly patients at high risk.
32240751,Palliative care teams may consider expanding their communication training and skillsets to help families consider caring ways to communicate with their children and grandchildren about the coronavirus.
32240751,Palliative care teams are wise to encourage families to ground their communication with children on key values: honesty and trust, self-compassion, safety, sensitivity, connection, preparedness, community-building, recognition of death as a part of the lifecycle, and legacy.
32240754,Therefore, palliative care is an important part of the response to this pandemic.
32240754,UW Medicine developed a strategy to implement a palliative care response for a multi-hospital healthcare system that incorporates conventional capacity, contingency capacity, and crisis capacity.
32240754,The strategy was developed by our palliative care programs with input from the healthcare system leadership.
32240754,In this publication, we share our multi-faceted strategy to implement high-quality palliative care in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic that incorporates conventional, contingency, and crisis capacity and focuses on the areas of the hospital caring for the most patients: the emergency department, the intensive care units, and the acute care services.
32240754,Strategy planning for delivery of high-quality palliative care in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic represents an important area of need for our healthcare systems.
32240756,Within weeks, COVID-19 has transformed our practice of palliative care and clinical medicine as we know it.
32240756,In this article, we share just-in-time tips to support palliative care clinicians and program leaders in providing the best care possible by telemedicine.
32241244,Since most patients with COVID-19 infection share typical imaging features, radiological examinations have an irreplaceable role in screening, diagnosis and monitoring treatment effects in clinical practice.
32242347,To allocate medical resources efficiently, Korea implemented a novel institution for the purpose of treating patients with cohort isolation out of hospital, namely the Community Treatment Center (CTC).
32242348,Six patients (21.4%) required supplemental oxygen therapy, but no one needed mechanical ventilation.
32242438,Mild cases can be managed at home with self-isolation, symptomatic treatment and follow-up if the disease worsens.
32242947,We aim to explore reliable evidence for the diagnosis and treatment of the COVID-19 by analyzing all the published studies by Chinese scholars on the clinical and imaging features in novel coronavirus pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2.
32243304,Analyses of early prognosis were based on clinical outcomes and trends in laboratory results during treatment.
32243304,Surgical treatment should be carried out cautiously or nonoperative care should be chosen for patients with fracture in COVID-19-affected areas, especially older individuals with intertrochanteric fractures.
32243668,Many cancer patients frequently visit the hospital for treatment and disease surveillance.
32243668,They may be immunocompromised due to the underlying malignancy or anticancer therapy and are at higher risk of developing infections.
32243690,Based on the severity of clinical symptoms, chest computer tomography findings and SARS-Cov-2 RNA test results, we admitted the husband to the respiratory intensive care unit (RICU) and used a treatment consisting of immunosuppressant reduction/cessation and low dose methylprednisolone-based therapy, and his wife to the respiratory isolation ward.
32243697,Both patients were on immunosuppressant therapy and had stable graft function before COVID-19 infection.
32243911,COVID-19 is a new infectious disease, for which there is currently no treatment.
32243945,Although all the four patients (including a pregnant woman) recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection eventually, randomized trials are needed to eliminate the effect of other treatments and investigate the safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma therapy.
32244059,Currently, there is no proven effective therapy against the virus, and the impact on other diseases is also uncertain, especially inherited arrhythmia syndrome.
32245083,The scientific community raced to uncover the origin of the virus, understand the pathogenesis of the disease, develop treatment options, define the risk factors, and work on vaccine development.
32245264,The COVID-19 coronavirus is currently spreading around the globe with limited treatment options available.
32245264,This article presents the rationale for potentially using old drugs (emetine, other ipecac alkaloids or analogues) that have been used to treat amoebiasis in the treatment of COVID-19.
32245264,This paper also discusses the known side effects of emetine and related compounds, how those side effects can be managed, and the optimal method of administration for the potential treatment of COVID-19.
32245264,Given the serious and immediate threat that the COVID-19 coronavirus poses, our long history with emetine and the likely ability of emetine to reach therapeutic concentrations within the lungs, ipecac, emetine, and other analogues should be considered as potential treatment options, especially if in vitro studies confirm viral sensitivity.
32245395,In this Commentary, we would like to comment on the article titled &quot;A rapid advice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infected pneumonia (standard version)&quot; as a featured article in Military Medical Research.
32245396,On 6 February 2020, our team had published a rapid advice guideline for diagnosis and treatment of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection, and this guideline provided our experience and make well reference for fighting against this pandemic worldwide.
32245396,However, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are gradually increasing based on the ongoing research findings and clinical practice experience; hence, the strategies of diagnosis and treatment are also continually updated.
32245396,In this letter, we answered one comment on our guideline and provided the newest diagnostic criteria of &quot;suspected case&quot; and &quot;confirmed case&quot; according to the latest Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh version) that issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
32245590,Meanwhile, Traditional Chinese Medicine can provide the more effective and personalized treatment via adjusting the specific medicine for each patient based on the different syndromes.
32245590,In addition, TCM often has different effect on the distinct stages of diseases, contributing to the prevention, treatment and rehabilitation.
32245590,Therefore, it is convinced that Traditional Chinese Medicine is an effective treatment for 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia.
32245814,Hospital beds, intensive care units (ICUs), and ventilators are vital for the treatment of patients with severe illness.
32245814,In scenario analyses, we varied the delay from symptom onset to self-isolation, the proportion of symptomatic individuals practicing self-isolation, and the basic reproduction number <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> Without self-isolation, when <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> = 2.5, treatment of critically ill individuals at the outbreak peak would require 3.8 times more ICU beds than exist in the United States.
32245904,To date, no effective treatment has been identified and management for critically ill patients relies on management in intensive care units.
32245904,Therefore, the risk/benefit ratio of systemic anticancer treatment (SACT) has to be considered.
32245904,For each patient, several factors including age and comorbidities, as well as the number of hospital visits for treatment, can influence this risk.
32245904,We hereby propose a tool to support oncologists and physicians in treatment decision for patients with lung cancer.
32245904,There are several variables to consider, including the extent of the epidemic, the local healthcare structure capacity, the risk of infection to the individual, the status of cancer, patients' comorbidities, age and details of the treatment.
32246280,All the 48 public tertiary dental hospitals suspended general non-emergency dental treatment while providing emergency dental services only.
32246317,Whether patients with elevated D-dimer could benefit from anticoagulant treatment was evaluated.
32246317,Patients with severe pneumonia induced by SARS-CoV2 had higher platelet count than those induced by non-SARS-CoV2, and only the former with markedly elevated D-dimer may benefit from anticoagulant treatment.
32246787,In this paper we summarize what is known about the stress-sleep link and confinement as well as effective insomnia treatment.
32246787,We suggest adaptions of cognitive behavioral therapy elements that are feasible to implement for those facing changed work schedules and requirements, those with health anxiety and those handling childcare and homeschooling, whilst also recognizing the general limitations imposed on physical exercise and social interaction.
32246834,No specific antiviral drugs have been approved for the treatment of COVID-2019.
32246879,Over the past few decades, several blood-borne viruses have targeted hemophilia patients requiring treatment with clotting factors derived from human plasma [1].
32247050,Based on recently published literatures, official documents and selected up-to-date preprint studies, we reviewed the virology and origin, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, pathology and treatment of 2019-nCoV infection, in comparison with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection.
32247056,Specialist Palliative Care services (SPCS) have a vital role to play in the global COVID-19 pandemic.

32253759,Tocilizumab (TCZ), a monoclonal antibody against interleukin-6 (IL-6), emerged as an alternative treatment for COVID-19 patients with a risk of cytokine storms recently.
32253759,In the present study, we aimed to discuss the treatment response of TCZ therapy in COVID-19 infected patients.
32253759,The demographic, treatment, laboratory parameters of C-reactive protein (CRP) and IL-6 before and after TCZ therapy and clinical outcome in the 15 COVID-19 patients were retrospectively assessed.
32253759,Although TCZ treatment ameliorated the increased CRP in all patients rapidly, for the four critically ill patients who received an only single dose of TCZ, three of them (No. 1, 2, and 3) still dead and the CRP level in the rest one patient (No. 7) failed to return to normal range with a clinical outcome of disease aggravation.
32253759,Serum IL-6 level tended to further spiked firstly and then decreased after TCZ therapy in 10 patients.
32253759,A persistent and dramatic increase of IL-6 was observed in these four patients who failed treatment.
32253759,TCZ appears to be an effective treatment option in COVID-19 patients with a risk of cytokine storms.
32253799,It is distinguishable by its longer incubation period, more varied morphology with initially urticarial and later targetoid and arcuate plaques, recalcitrance to therapy and longer duration.

32253891,The surgeon participated in emergency medical rescue could provide professional treatment for the patients combined with surgical diseases, specialized training for the non-surgeon crew, to reduce surgical-related mortality.
32254064,To date, there are no proven options for prophylaxis for those who have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2, nor therapy for those who develop COVID-19.
32254064,There are numerous examples, where convalescent plasma has been used successfully as post-exposure prophylaxis and/or treatment of infectious diseases, including other outbreaks of coronaviruses (e.g., SARS-1, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome [MERS]).
32254064,Data from rigorously controlled clinical trials of convalescent plasma are also few, underscoring the need to evaluate its use objectively for a range of indications (e.g., prevention vs treatment) and patient populations (e.g., age, comorbid disease).
32255382,Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and treatment data were collected and analyzed, and final date of follow-up was February 24, 2020.
32255489,Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) appears to be a promising treatment for COVID-19.
32255510,In patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 disease, all immunomodulators used for skin diseases should be immediately withheld, with the possible exception of systemic corticosteroid therapy, which needs to be weaned.
32256547,More than 80 clinical trials have been launched to test coronavirus treatment, including some drug repurposing or repositioning for COVID-19.
32256705,No conclusive evidence for or against the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the treatment of COVID-19 patients is available, nor is there evidence indicating that TNFα blockade is harmful to patients in the context of COVID-19.
32256705,Although there are potential targets in the JAK-STAT pathway that can be manipulated in treatment for coronaviruses and it is evident that IL-1 is elevated in patients with a coronavirus, there is currently no evidence for a role of these drugs in treatment of COVID-19.
32256705,The COVID-19 pandemic has led to challenging decision-making about treatment of critically unwell patients.
32257537,Among them, two common and one severe patient were recovered and discharged in 10 days after treatment.
32257537,After treatment, the peripheral lymphocytes were increased, the C-reactive protein decreased, and the overactivated cytokine-secreting immune cells CXCR3+CD4+ T cells, CXCR3+CD8+ T cells, and CXCR3+ NK cells disappeared in 3-6 days.
32257537,Meanwhile, the level of TNF-α was significantly decreased, while IL-10 increased in MSC treatment group compared to the placebo control group.
32257537,Thus, the intravenous transplantation of MSCs was safe and effective for treatment in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, especially for the patients in critically severe condition.
32257554,Therefore, MSC therapy inhibiting the overactivation of the immune system and promoting endogenous repair by improving the lung microenvironment after the SARS-CoV-2 infection found in this study is striking.
32258207,Until now, no definite effective treatment has been identified.
32258351,In particular, the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has quickly intensified interest in developing treatment options to mitigate impact on human life.
32258351,Remdesivir (GS-5734™) is a broad-spectrum antiviral drug that is now being tested as a potential treatment for COVID-19 in international, multi-site clinical trials.
32259123,Where needed, clients are referred to 16-hour treatment clinics, which are specifically set up for the diagnosis and treatment of the disease, to the hospitals, or will be treated at home.
32259129,Therefore, studies with a large sample size are required to determine the efficacy of metronidazole in the treatment of COVID-19 infection.
32259247,Access to pain treatment has been called a fundamental human right by numerous organizations.
32259313,As the incidence continues to rise at a rapid pace, critical care teams are faced with challenging treatment decisions.
32259313,Urgent identification of potential treatment strategies is a priority.
32259477,Thus, ferrets represent an infection and transmission animal model of COVID-19 that may facilitate development of SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics and vaccines.
32259899,The only method to understand the clustering and the immediate hospital resource needs is mandatory, uniform, daily reporting of hospital censuses of COVID-19 cases admitted to hospital wards and intensive care units.
32264666,Although several comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases are defined as a risk factor for developing the acute respiratory syndrome and need for intensive care; immune-compromised situations such as rheumatic disease which require immunosuppressive treatment strikingly are not found to be a risk factor for more severe disease course.
32265310,Limited pre-clinical data suggest that systemic MSC administration can significantly reduce respiratory virus (Influenza strains H5N1 and H9N2)-induced lung injury, however, there are no available data in models of coronavirus respiratory infection.There are a rapidly increasing number of clinical investigations of cell-based therapy approaches for COVID-19.
32265848,This review was written for the topic of <i>Antivirals for Emerging Viruses: Vaccines and Therapeutics</i> in the <i>Virology</i> section of <i>Frontiers in Microbiology</i>.

32266708,Cardiovascular diseases, in particular hypertension, as well as the cardiovascular treatment with Renin-Angiotensin System inhibitors such as Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs), are claimed once again as mechanisms of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) during the COVID-19 outbreak due to Cov-2 epidemics.
32266987,To assess the efficacy of corticosteroid treatment of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32266987,Virus clearance time, length of hospital stay, and duration of symptoms, by treatment type (including or not including corticosteroid therapy).
32266987,Eleven of 31 patients with COVID-19 received corticosteroid treatment.
32266987,Cox proportional hazards regression analysis indicated no association between corticosteroid treatment and virus clearance time (hazard ratio [HR], 1.26; 95% CI, 0.58-2.74), hospital length of stay (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.33-1.78), or duration of symptoms (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.40-1.83).
32266987,Corticosteroids are widely used when treating patients with COVID-19, but we found no association between therapy and outcomes in patients without acute respiratory distress syndrome.
32266994,In addition, we would like to mention that amiloride, which increases the cytosolic pH, can be used in the COVID-19 treatment.
32267109,In the absence of specific anti-viral molecules, treatment is currently mainly symptomatic.
32267139,This axis might be a potential target for the treatment of brain metastasis of lung cancer.
32267556,A number of novel and repurposed therapies agents with activity against SARS-CoV-2 have been identified and most institutions have developed clinical pathways to operationalize their use in appropriate COVID-19 patients.<sup>1-3</sup> However, optimal drug therapy decisions for those with moderate to severe COVID-19 infections are extremely challenging at this time as evidence is limited.
32267560,The main mechanism of ARDS is uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response and cytokine storm following release of proinflammatory cytokines (such as interferons (IFN), interleukines (IL), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α) and chemokines.<sup>2-3</sup> So, some Chinese researchers proposed or used anti-inflammatory agents in the treatment regimen of patients with COVID-19.<sup>3-4</sup>.
32267566,Based on the available evidence we believe that tetracyclines may be effective agents in the treatment of COVID-19.
32267771,Here, we present the rationale and design of a large, international trial that combines features of adaptive platform trials with pragmatic point-of-care trials to determine best treatment strategies for patients admitted to an intensive care unit with severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).
32267771,The trial randomizes patients to multiple interventions within 4 treatment domains: antibiotics, antiviral therapy for influenza, host immunomodulation with extended macrolide therapy, and alternative corticosteroid regimens, representing 240 treatment regimens.
32267987,At present, there is no specific antiviral therapy for COVID-19 and the main treatments are supportive.
32267998,There is evidence in both animals and humans that fibrinolytic therapy in Acute Lung Injury and ARDS improves survival, which also points to fibrin deposition in the pulmonary microvasculature as a contributory cause of ARDS and would be expected to be seen in patients with ARDS and concomitant diagnoses of DIC on their laboratory values such as what is observed in more than 70% of those who die of COVID-19 (8-10).
32268005,Therapeutics are desperately needed to reduce the morbidity and mortality of this pandemic disease.
32268005,It has been reported that hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is active against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, and this finding was quickly supported by an open label non-randomized clinical trial that provided the first published clinical evidence HCQ may be a treatment option.

32270592,Five (50.0%) patients received antiviral treatment.
32271376,When comparing patients with early (&lt;15 days) and late viral RNA clearance (≥15 days after illness onset), prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding was associated with male sex (p=0.009), old age (p=0.033), concomitated with hypertension (p=0.009), delayed admission to hospital after illness onset (p=0.001), severe illness at admission (p=0.049), invasive mechanical ventilation (p=0.006), and corticosteroid treatment (p=0.025).
32271454,Employing combined therapy of modern medicine and traditional Chinese medicine has been proposed, in which Ma Xing Shi Gan Decoction (MXSGD) was recommended as a basic prescription and applied widely in the clinical treatment of COVID-19.
32271455,The treatment of severe COVID-19 patients has been rarely reported.
32271456,Both groups achieved good therapeutic effect with the body temperature of patients decreased gradually from admission to the 10th day of treatment.
32271456,The number of days for nCoV-RNA turning negative after treatment was significantly decreased in the test group than that in the control group.
32271456,Compared with the treatment of pneumonia-associated adjuvant drugs alone, the combination treatment with LPV/r and adjuvant drugs has a more evident therapeutic effect in lowering the body temperature and restoring normal physiological mechanisms with no evident toxic and side effects.
32271456,In view of these conclusions, we suggested that the use of LPV/r combined with pneumonia-associated adjuvant drugs in the clinical treatment for patients with COVID-19 should be promoted.
32271458,The status of the infected cases can be determined basing on the treatment process along with several other factors.
32271459,A retrospective analysis was performed on the confirmed cases of COVID-19, who were admitted to the North Hospital of Changsha first Hospital (Changsha Public Health treatment Center) from January 17 to February 7, 2020.

32283219,We describe our rapid and ongoing implementation of telepalliative medicine consultation for our inpatient palliative care teams and discuss lessons learned and recommendations for programs considering similar care models.
32283324,Since severe complications in adults are frequently caused by uncontrolled immune responses and a resulting &quot;cytokine storm&quot; that may be controlled by targeted blockade of cytokines, previously established treatment with immunosuppressive treatments may indeed protect children from complications.
32283325,We aimed to clarify the features of COVID-19-related liver damage to provide references for clinical treatment.
32283815,At the moment, there is no specific antiviral treatment recommended for the COVID-19 pandemic and the therapeutic strategies to deal with the infection are only supportive.
32284379,In sum, we demonstrate the importance of potassium ions to virus infection, suggesting a potential therapeutic target to disrupt virus replication.<b>Importance</b> No antivirals are approved for the treatment of bunyavirus infection.
32284951,On behalf of the Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists, we herein summarize the current evidence as of March 18, 2020 to provide guidance on potential COVID-19 treatment options.
32284951,It is important to caution readers that new data emerges daily regarding clinical characteristics, treatment options, and outcomes for COVID-19.

32285293,This article will summarize the role of ACE2 in multiple organ damage caused by COVID-19 and SARS-CoV, targeted blocking drugs against ACE2, and drugs that inhibit inflammation in order to provide the basis for subsequent related research, diagnosis and treatment, and drug development.
32285338,Few studies have been performed on viral transmission during surgery, but to date there is no study that demonstrates or can suggest the ability for a virus to be transmitted during surgical treatment whether open or laparoscopic.
32285555,Intensive care units are facing a surge of patients requiring invasive ventilation.It is likely that requests for a tracheostomy in COVID-19 ventilated patients will soon come our way.
32285930,Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is a promising candidate for Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19) treatment.
32285930,Our goal was to integrate historic and emerging pharmacological and toxicity data to understand safe and efficacious HCQ dosing strategies for COVID-19 treatment.
32285930,HCQ doses &gt; 400 mg BID for ≥5 days were predicted to rapidly decrease viral loads, reduce the proportion of patients with detectable SARS-CoV-2 infection, and shorten treatment courses, compared to lower dose (≤400 mg daily) regimens.
32285949,Chest computed tomography (CT) showed different abnormalities from those of conventional COVID-19, and the faster absorption of pulmonary lesions also highlights the importance of antiretroviral therapy in this patient.
32285949,This report provides reference for the diagnosis and treatment of HIV-infected patients with COVID-19.
32286679,A significant number of patients with pneumonia require passive oxygen therapy.
32286679,Non-invasive ventilation and high-flow nasal oxygen therapy can be applied in mild and moderate non-hypercapnia cases.
32286679,Specific pharmacological treatment for COVID-19 is not currently available.
32286679,The key is a holistic approach to the patient including, primarily, the use of personal protective equipment to reduce the risk of further virus transmission, as well as patient management, which consists in both quarantine and, in the absence of specific pharmacological therapy, symptomatic treatment.
32286766,This review analyzes information from worldwide research and experience on the epidemiology, prevention, and treatment of COVID-19, and offers links to the most reliable and trustworthy resources to help equip healthcare professionals in managing this public health challenge.
32286790,The proposed peptide inhibitors could provide simple and efficient therapeutics against the COVID-19 disease.
32286947,This pandemic emphasizes the need to be constantly alert to shifts in both the global dynamics and the contexts of individual countries, making sure that all are aware of which approaches are successful for the prevention, containment and treatment of new diseases, and being flexible enough to adapt the responses accordingly.
32287140,All patients were confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction and were analyzed for clinical characteristics, laboratory data, and treatment.
32287140,Patients with digestive symptoms had higher mean liver enzyme levels, lower monocyte count, longer prothrombin time, and received more antimicrobial treatment than those without digestive symptoms.
32288414,Following Law of the People's Republic of China on Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases and other related regulations, medical institutions have been authorized to collect the detailed information of patients, while it is still a formidable task in megacities because of the significant patient mobility and the existing information sharing barrier.
32289016,We searched 7 data sources for eligible traditional medicine guidelines up to March 6, 2020 and found a total of 28 traditional medicine guidelines that provide treatment measures for COVID-19.
32289016,This review can be used as guidance for the traditional medicine treatment of COVID-19.
32289376,Although the treatment and protective standards are continuously evolving, this commentary shares our thoughts on how an institution, specifically surgical services may develop collaborative process improvement to accommodate for rapid and ongoing change.
32289472,Management is predominantly focused on the provision of supportive care, with oxygen therapy representing the major treatment intervention.
32289472,Medical therapy involving corticosteroids and antivirals have also been encouraged as part of critical management schemes.
32289472,However, there is at present no specific antiviral recommended for the treatment of COVID-19, and no vaccine is currently available.
32289548,We need an effective treatment to cure COVID-19 patients and to decrease virus carriage duration.
32289548,Furthermore, the cost of treatment is negligible.
32289565,All patients were given antiviral therapy.
32289791,Using Richardson and Davidson's model and the sciences of pharmacokinetics and clinical pharmacopsychology, this article reviewed the: (1) poor life expectancy associated with treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS), which may be improved in patients who adhere to clozapine; (2) findings that clozapine is the best treatment for TRS (according to efficacy, effectiveness and well-being); and (3) potential for clozapine to cause vulnerabilities, including potentially lethal adverse drug reactions such as agranulocytosis, pneumonia, and myocarditis.
32290293,Although our understanding of coronaviruses has undergone a huge leap after two precedents, the effective approaches to treatment and epidemiological control are still lacking.
32290643,To summarize the administration model of a COVID-19 designated hospital transformed from a community hospital to improve the emergency capacity of community hospitals and the efficiency of diagnosis and treatment of medical staff in the COVID-19 pandemic.
32290643,Analyze the surrounding environment, ward layout, area management, treatment process, medical staff and patient management of the designated community hospital.
32290643,Its diagnosis and treatment model has completed the treatment of COVID- 19 patients successfully.
32290643,After adjustment, this community hospital can shoulder the critical task of being a designated hospital for COVID-19, which includes admission, isolation, and therapy of suspected and mild COVID-19 patients, reducing the medical burden of superior hospitals.
32290754,Cancer patients represent a vulnerable population due to the acquired immunodeficiency associated with anti-cancer therapy.
32290839,Moreover, Tocilizumab treatment that blocking IL-6 receptors showed inspiring clinical results including temperature returned to normal quickly and respiratory function improved.
32290839,Therefore, we suggest that Tocilizumab is an effective treatment in severe patients of COVID-19 to calm the inflammatory storm and reduce mortality.
32291076,Our discovery provides clues for pathogenesis and targeted drug therapy towards ACE2 expression for prevention and adjuvant therapy of COVID-19.
32291112,Here, we review currently registered interventional clinical trials for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 to provide an overall summary and insight into the global response.
32291505,However, about 5% become critically ill and require intensive care treatment.
32291505,To date there is no specific treatment available-the main goal of supportive therapy is to ascertain adequate oxygenation.
32291526,This editorial presents the available evidence to guide treatment practices during this pandemic.
32291542,In this review, we summarized the epidemiological characteristics, clinical features, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of COVID-19.
32291906,Thus they suggested the anticoagulant treatment in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32291968,Patients with cancer are more likely than the general population to contract COVID-19 because of the systemic immunosuppressive status caused by malignant diseases or anticancer treatment.
32291968,Most patients with lung cancer are smokers with poor underlying lung conditions and low immunity, thus it is vital to protect them from epidemic diseases during cancer treatment.
32291968,It is necessary to provide individualized medical treatment and management of treatment-related adverse events for patients with lung cancer based on patients' conditions and regional epidemic patterns.
32292012,<b>Objective:</b> Todiscuss the the effects, indications and protective measures of tracheotomy for severe cases of 2019 novel corona virus disease(COVID-19)patients. <b>Methods:</b> A retrospectively analyze was conducted to explore the clinical data of ofCOVID-19 patients who received tracheotomy in February to March 2020,descriptive statistics were used to analyze the indication of tracheotomy, particularity of intraoperative treatment and protective measures. <b>Results:</b> A total of 4 cases were included in this article, 3 cases were successfully operated, 1 case of postoperative incision continuous bleeding, there were not other complications and nosocomial infection among the medical staff.the patient's condition was relieved in different degrees after the operation, who remain hospitalized. <b>Conclusion:</b> Tracheotomy for severe cases of COVID-19 can achieve certain curative effect, but the occurrence of tracheotomy related complicationsand nosocomial infection should be effectively controlled, and the risk benefit ratio of tracheotomy should be carefully weighed before surgery. <b>目的：</b> 探讨新型冠状病毒肺炎危重型患者施行气管切开术的指征、术中处理的特殊性及防护措施。
32292113,In this commentary, we offer an alternative promising therapy for COVID-19, that is, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) transplantation.
32292205,The COVID-19 epidemic should be considered a global threat and the steps for control include early diagnosis and treatment, as well as isolation.
32292260,Several dental care facilities in affected countries have been completely closed or have been only providing minimal treatment for emergency cases.
32292260,However, several facilities in some affected countries are still providing regular dental treatment.
32292517,Three kinds of responses to clinical treatment were defined and evaluated: 1) good, symptoms continually improved; 2) fair, symptoms not improved or relapsed; 3) poor, symptoms aggravated.
32292517,The progression in abnormal imaging findings indicate a poor/fair response, whereas the alleviated symptoms seen from CT suggest a good response. <b>Conclusion:</b> Most cases are no-emergency type and have a favorable response to clinical treatment.
32292517,Follow-up CT changes during the treatment can help evaluate the treatment response of patients with NCP.
32292529,As the epicentre of the initial outbreak, China has been updating the National COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guideline with up-to-date information about the disease.
32292587,Our study aimed to present an overview of the virus in terms of structure, epidemiology, symptoms, treatment, and prevention.
32292627,Collectively, these results suggest that MSCs significantly improve survival rate of H7N9 induced ARDS and provide a theoretical basis for the treatment of H7N9 induced ARDS in both preclinical research and clinical studies.
32292627,Because H7N9 and the corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) share similar complications (such as ARDS and lung failure) and corresponding multi-organ dysfunction, MSC-based therapy could be a possible alternative for treating COVID-19.
32292632,By taking these strategies, the hospital effectively improved the coping capacity of the nursing team and played a positive role in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.
32292634,This consensus included nursing assessment, nursing priorities, nursing goals, and thirteen key points of nursing procedures such as nursing of oxygen therapy and respiratory nursing.
32292636,This article aims to summarize a series of contingency management strategies of the Nursing Department in the centralized treatment of patients with coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19).
32292636,The strategies of the Nursing Department included early warning for prevention and control, taking functions of vertically commanding and horizontally coordinating, and reasonably allocating nursing workforce, to facilitate centralized treatment work in the in-hospital fever clinic, isolation wards and ICU, and referral and admission of critical patients.
32292636,Through the implementation of these strategies, safe and efficient centralized treatment was ensured timely, orderly and sustainably.
32292686,To date, there is no specific therapy for COVID-19.
32292691,Using spatial panel models, we analyse the relationship between confirmed cases of COVID-19, deaths thereof, and recovered cases due to treatment.
32292693,The current health crisis caused by COVID-19 is a challenge for oncology treatment, especially when it comes to radiotherapy.
32292693,In order to treat patients safely while protecting medical teams, the entire health care system must optimize the way it approaches prevention and treatment at a time when social distancing is key to stemming this pandemic.
32292693,All indications and treatment modalities must be re-discussed.
32292693,In this short piece, the members of the GEMO (the European Study Group of Bone Metastases) offer a number of recommendations to achieve the above objectives, both in general and in relation to five of the most common situations on radiation therapy for bone metastases.
32292697,Osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is a common disabling complication among convalescent SARS patients who received corticosteroid therapy.
32292697,In China, a considerable number of convalescent SARS patients with steroid-associated ONFH had undergone conservative treatment by Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), and this study aims to evaluate the long-term results of a spleen-invigorating Huo-Gu Formula (HGF) therapy in these patients. and methods: A total of 33 convalescent SARS patients (nine males and 24 females) with bilateral steroid-associated ONFH (66 hips) were enrolled in this study.
32292697,All patients received oral HGF therapy for six months when they were confirmed the diagnosis of steroid-associated ONFH.
32292697,Based on average 14 years of follow-up of HGF therapy (ranging from six to 16 years), 38 hips (57%) among the 66 hips developed definite osteoarthritis, and 14 hips (26%) in 53 pre-collapse hips (ARCO stage I or II) progressed to femoral head collapse(ARCO stage III or IV).
32292697,Chinese herbal HGF therapy demonstrates beneficial effects on preventing femoral head collapse, delaying total hip arthroplasty (THA)surgery, and maintaining physical function in the treatment of steroid-associated ONFH.
32292697,HGF therapy might be therefore a good alternative for the treatment of steroid-associated ONFH secondary to rheumatologic and infection diseases.
32292802,In addition we have also provided information about transmission dynamics, prevention measures and treatment options that are available at the present.
32292802,Joint efforts of global scientific community are needed at this hour in terms of enhancement of research on development of accurate diagnostics, antiviral therapeutics and finally into formation of an effective vaccine against the emerging novel coronavirus.
32292805,Unfortunately, for most of them, the drug products available on the market are not designed to be administered by a nasogastric tube to inpatients of intensive care units.
32292817,We have studied its use as an antimalarial, an antiviral, and an immunomodulating drug and concluded that the use of HCQ at does matching that of the standard treatment of Systemic Lupus erythematous, which has proven safety and efficacy in terms of HCQ blood and tissue concentration adapted to bodyweight (2,3), at 6 mg/kg/day 1 (loading dose) followed by 5 mg/kg/day, with a maximum limit of 600 mg/day in all cases should swiftly be clinically evaluated as a post-exposure drug for exposed people.
32292826,While there is no intervention for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19 with proven clinical efficacy to date, tools to distil the current research landscape by intervention, level of evidence and those studies likely powered to address future research questions is essential.
32292839,During a global pandemic the benefit of routine visits and treatment of cancer patients must be weighed against the risks to patients, staff, and society.
32292839,Treatment can be avoided or delayed until safe for very low, low, and favorable intermediate-risk disease.
32292839,Unfavorable intermediate-risk, high-risk, clinical node positive, recurrence post-surgery, oligometastatic, and low-volume M1 disease can receive neoadjuvant hormone therapy for 4-6 months as necessary.
32292847,Dealing with the immense challenge of COVID-19 disease, confronted with severely ill patients in dire straits with virtually no rigorous evidence base to guide our therapy, we must call upon our clinical skills and judgment.
32292847,Lacking a robust evidence base, pathophysiologic reasoning can help guide our choices of therapy for individual clinical scenarios.
32292848,We review the most current data with a focus on our basic understanding of the mechanism(s) of disease and translation to the clinical syndrome and potential therapeutics.
32292866,During the first phase of the disease (from onset of the symptoms up to 7-10 days) viral-induced effects are prominent with the opportunity to institute antiviral therapy.
32292904,The diagnosis, infection control, and treatment of COVID-19 in hemodialysis patients are discussed in this report, and we conclude with recommendations for how a dialysis facility can respond to COVID-19 based on our experiences.
32292909,For this emergency, the FDA has approved Remdesivir and Hydroxychloroquine for treatment of COVID-19 as Emergency Use Authorization.
32292917,We describe the percutaneous treatment of an unprotected left main coronary artery in a patient who is positive for coronavirus disease 2019 with unstable angina, dyspnea and fever.
32293003,This raised multiple questions regarding a more severe course of COVID-19 in relation to hypertension itself as well as its treatment with renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers, e.g. angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs).
32293003,We also review in detail the molecular mechanisms linking the RAS to lung damage and the potential clinical impact of treatment with RAS blockers in patients with COVID-19 and a high cardiovascular and renal risk.
32293020,Symptomatic (palliative) treatment is of fundamental importance both in conjuncture with life-sustaining interventions and in end of life care.
32293020,Based on the evidence to date, there are several treatment options to consider for the relief of fever (acetaminophen, NSAID, oral glucocorticoids), cough (morphine), breathlessness (morphine, oxygen, fan), anxiety (benzodiazepines) and pain (NSAID, morphine).
32293020,Top priorities include precautions to protect staff and people at-risk from infection and planning how to provide adequate treatment for each individual depending on setting, including palliative care.
32293168,Thus, we have successfully fabricated a promising FET biosensor for SARS-CoV-2; our device is a highly sensitive immunological diagnostic method for COVID-19 that requires no sample pretreatment or labeling.
32293713,In order to evaluate the efficacy of convalescent plasma therapy in COVID-19 patients, we did this timely descriptive study. 6 laboratory confirmed COVID-19 patients were enrolled and received the transfusion of ABO-compatible convalescent plasma.
32293713,No obvious adverse effect observed during the treatment.
32293713,In patient #1 and #5 who presented with SARS-CoV-2 in throat swab, convalescent plasma therapy elicited an elimination of virus.
32293713,This study indicates that convalescent plasma therapy is effective and specific for COVID-19.
32293713,This intervention has a special significance for eliminating SARS-CoV-2 and is believed to be a promising state-of-art therapy during COVID-19 pandemic crisis.
32293714,The patient recovered after treatment and was discharged.
32293715,A backlog of procedures after the end of the COVID-19 pandemic is inevitable, and hospitals should plan how to address this effectively to ensure that patients having elective treatment have the best possible outcomes.
32293807,Several antiretroviral drugs are being considered for the treatment of COVID-19, the disease caused by a newly identified coronavirus, (SARS-CoV-2).
32293807,We systematically reviewed the clinical outcomes of using antiretroviral drugs for the prevention and treatment of coronaviruses and planned clinical trials.
32293807,From an initial screen of 433 titles, two randomized trials and 24 observational studies provided clinical outcome data on the use of antiretroviral drugs; most studies reported outcomes using LPV/r as treatment.
32293807,Of the 21 observational studies reporting treatment outcomes, there were three studies among patients with SARS, six studies among patients with MERS and 12 studies among patients with COVID-19.
32293831,The precautions to be taken against this virus, where our knowledge is extremely small, intensive care units take an indispensable place in pandemic planning.
32293834,Currently, there is not any specific effective anti-viral treatment for COVID-19.
32293834,Optimized supportive care remains the mainstay of therapy.
32293834,Despite the urgent need to find an effective antiviral treatment for COVID-19 through randomized controlled studies, certain agents are being used all over the world based on either in-vitro or extrapolated evidence or observational studies.
32293834,Nitazoxanide and ivermectin were also included in this review as they have recently been reported to have an activity against SARS-CoV-2 in-vitro and are licensed for the treatment of some other human infections.
32293835,Unfortunately, there is no medication that has been approved by the FDA, gone through controlled studies and demonstrated an effect on the virus for this global pandemic.
32293910,Appropriate treatment for heart failure, arrhythmias, acute coronary syndrome and thrombosis remain important.
32293910,Specific evidence based treatment strategies for COVID-19 will emerge with ongoing global collaboration on multiple approaches being evaluated.
32294179,Here we review the basic and clinical science spanning the intersections of diabetes, coronavirus infections, ACE2, and DPP4 biology, highlighting clinical relevance and evolving areas of uncertainty underlying the pathophysiology and treatment of T2D in the context of coronavirus infection.
32294289,In this retrospective analysis, conducted at the Tongji Hospital of Wuhan, China, it is reported that heparin treatment reduces mortality in subjects affected by severe COVID-19 who have &quot;sepsis-induced coagulopathy&quot;.
32294485,The severity on admission, complications, treatment, and outcomes of COVID-19 patients were evaluated.
32294562,Several antiviral medications: Zanamivir, Indinavir, Saquinavir, and Remdesivir show potential as and 3CL<sup>PRO</sup> main proteinase inhibitors and as a treatment of COVID-19.
32294562,It is also exciting to uncover that Flavin Adenine Dinucleotide (FAD) Adeflavin, B2 Deficiency medicine, and Coenzyme A, a coenzyme, may also be potentially used for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections.
32294562,The use of these off-label medications may be beneficial in the treatment of the COVID-19.
32294763,The transfer of the patients after acute care treatment is needed urgently to facilitate the weaning process.
32294763,In a next step we developed a triage algorithm to identify patients at SAVE intensive care units with potential to wean and transfer to weaning institutions - we called POST SAVE.
32294763,This manuscript highlights the algorithms including the use of a standardised digital evaluation tool, the use of trained navigators to facilitate the communication between SAVE intensive care units and weaning institutions and the establishment of a prospective data registry for patient assignment and reevaluation of the weaning potential in the future.
32294807,At present, there are no studies demonstrating the clinical efficacy of hydroxychloroquine for the prophylaxis or treatment of COVID-19 infection.
32294811,The treatment of critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) faces compelling challenges.
32294811,In this issue, we'd like to share our first-line treatment experience in treating COVID-19.
32294811,Nutritional support is the basis of treatment.
32294811,It's important to establish individual therapy regimens and to evaluate, monitor and adjust dynamically.
32294813,As such, we developed this consensus recommendations on all those high-risk treatments, based on the current evidence as well as the resource limitation in some areas, with the aim to reduce the nosocomial transmission and optimize the treatment for the COVID-19 pneumonia patients.
32294813,Those recommendations include: (1)Standard prevention and protection, and patient isolation; (2)Patient wearing mask during HFNC treatment; (3)Using dual limb ventilator with filters placed at the ventilator outlets, or using heat-moisture exchanger (HME) instead of heated humidification in single limb ventilator with HME placed between exhalation port and mask; avoid using mask with exhalation port on the mask; (4)Placing filter between resuscitator and mask or artificial airway; (5)For spontaneous breathing patients, placing mask for patients during bronchoscopy examination; for patients receiving noninvasive ventilation, using the special mask with bronchoscopy port to perform bronchoscopy; (6)Using sedation and paralytics during intubation, cuff pressure should be maintained between 25-30 cmH(2)O(1 cmH(2)O=0.098 kPa); (7)In-line suction catheter is recommended and it can be used for one week; (8)Dual-limb heated wire circuits are recommended and only changed with visible soiled; (9)For patients who need breathing support during transportation, placing an HME between ventilator and patient; (10)PSV is recommended for implementing spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), avoid using T-piece to do SBT.
32294813,(11)Avoid unnecessary bronchial hygiene therapy; (12) For patients who need aerosol therapy, dry powder inhaler metered dose inhaler with spacer is recommended for spontaneous breathing patients; while vibrating mesh nebulizer is recommended for ventilated patients and additional filter is recommended to be placed at the expiratory port of ventilation during nebulization.
32294816,The results showed that the positive rate of bronchoalveolar lavage for detection of new coronavirus nucleic acid was high, and bronchoalveolar lavage for suspected or confirmed new coronavirus pneumonia patients with negative detection of nucleic acid in pharynx swabs but still residual lung lesions was helpful for early diagnosis, treatment and prognosis.
32294817,But the pathogenesis and treatment of the disease are not clear yet.
32295322,<b>Objective:</b> To analyze the epidemiological characteristics and clinical features of the patients with 2019-nCoV infection in Nanyang City, so as to provide evidence for clinical diagnosis and treatment. <b>Methods:</b> The epidemiology, clinical symptoms, atory and radiologic data of 150 patients with 2019-nCoV infection admitted to the designated hospitals in Nanyang City from January 24,2020 to February 16, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. <b>Results:</b> The 150 patients with 2019 nCov infection consisted of 67 men and 83 women, and the median age was 45±16 years; 69 of them were the first generation case,60 of them were the second generation case, 6 of them were the third generation case,the median incubation period of the first generation case was 5.4±2.2 days, and the second generation case was 6.7±3.1 days, and the first-generation cases are the majority in severe patients (69%) .
32295322,After active treatment, 45% of patients were discharged according to discharge standards. 33% of sever and critically ill patients were discharged, 49% of them were degraded hospitalization.The average length of hospitalization was 12±4 days. <b>Conclusion:</b> A history of epidemiological exposure, fever, chest CT with signs of pneumonia, normal or decreased WBC, and lymphocytopenia, eosinophilia are the clinical basis for the diagnosis of this disease, and most of the sever patients were the first generation cases.
32295323,Sleep study and non-invasive positive airway pressure (NIPAP) therapy can increase the risk of exposure and transmission of new coronaviruses to medical staff and patients.
32295323,Based on the characteristics of sleep-disordered breathing, this consensus elaborates on the recommendations from the following four aspects that include patient and medical staff education, optimization of diagnostic and treatment protocols, sterilization of medical devices and the environment, and control of hospital-acquired infection.
32295658,In this comment, we report the unexpected beneficial effect of a deployable rapid-assembly shelter hospital on the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.
32295658,We describe the shelter hospital maintenance, treatment mode and primary treatment methods, which will provide a valuable experience in dealing with public health emergencies, such as COVID-19, for other countries and areas.
32296259,One postexposure prophylaxis, convalescent (immune) plasma (CP), has shown some success in China and previously in the cure and therapy of other coronaviruses, SARS-1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome.
32296735,In response to the outbreak of COVID-19 that has been sweeping the world, scientists reconstructed the SARS-CoV-2 rapidly using a synthetic genomics platform, in order to accelerate therapeutics and vaccine development.
32296817,The few trials which allow their inclusion focus on post-exposure prophylaxis or outpatient treatment of milder disease, limiting the options available to pregnant women with severe COVID-19 to compassionate use of remdesivir, or off-label drug use of hydroxychloroquine or other therapies.
32296817,In this Viewpoint, we call attention to the need and urgency to engage pregnant women in COVID-19 treatment trials now in order to develop data-driven recommendations regarding the risks and benefits of therapies in this unique but not uncommon population.
32296824,Our nomogram could help clinicians to early identify patients who will exacerbate to severe COVID-19, which will enable better centralized management and early treatment of severe patients.
32296888,For urology, the expansion of the health-care structures for the treatment of patients suffering from COVID-19 should be supported as best as possible.
32296888,For this, patients must be prioritized individually, alternative therapy concepts must be considered and regional and supraregional cooperation must be used.
32296888,Outpatient departments are of great importance in the care, examination and coordination of urological emergencies and urgent treatment.
32296910,We propose several mechanisms by which coronavirus disease 2019 causes thrombocytopenia to better understand this disease and provide more clinical treatment options.
32297089,The development of COVID-19 syndrome in anticoagulated patients, and especially their admission to intensive-care units with acute severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), expose them to specific problems related to their therapy, in addition to those associated with the acute viral infection.
32297089,Patients on DOAC are exposed to under/over treatment caused by significant pharmacological interferences.

32315980,This report supports the putative role of immunosuppressive therapy in COVID-19 affected patients.
32316065,Concomitant venous thromboembolism (VTE), a potential cause of unexplained deaths, has been frequently reported in COVID-19 cases, but its management is still challenging due to the complexity between antithrombotic therapy and coagulation disorders.
32316233,Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency screening test is essential for malaria treatment, control, and elimination programs.
32316233,G6PD deficient individuals are at high risk of severe hemolysis when given anti-malarial drugs such as primaquine, quinine, other sulphonamide-containing medicines, and chloroquine, which has recently been shown to be potent for the treatment of coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
32316233,Given the challenges associated with G6PD deficiency, it would be essential to improve access to G6PD deficiency POC testing to facilitate administration of sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine to pregnant women, full implementation of the malaria control program in Ghana, and treatment of COVID-19 patients with chloroquine in malaria-endemic countries.
32316618,The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive update on the pathogenesis, clinical aspects, diagnosis, challenges and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections.
32316712,The aims were to investigate medical needs of lung cancer patients and their mental health status during the epidemic periods, so as to provide rational recommendations for subsequent diagnosis and treatment.
32316712,Of the 368 patients, 18 patients were excluded as they didn't receive anti-tumor treatment, and 350 patients were included in the final analysis. 229 cases were treated with oral targeted drugs, and 121 cases were treated with chemotherapy or immunotherapy.
32316712,41.3% of patients treated with intravenous chemotherapy or immunotherapy experienced treatment discontinuation, and the proportion of treatment discontinuation in chemotherapy or immunotherapy was higher than those treated with oral targeted drugs (21.0%).

32317180,Immunosuppressant reduction and low-dose methylprednisolone therapy.
32317180,After a longer time of virus shedding (28.4 ± 9.3 vs 12.2 ± 4.6 d in the control group) and a longer course of illness (35.3 ± 8.3 vs 18.8 ± 10.5 d in the control group), nine of the 10 transplant patients recovered successfully after treatment.
32317180,Findings from this small group of cases may have important implications for the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia in immunosuppressed populations.
32317180,Immunosuppressed transplant recipients with coronavirus disease 2019 infection had more severe pneumonia, but most of them still achieved a good prognosis after appropriate treatment.
32317202,Hence, there is an urgent requirement for conducting academic research on several aspects of this highly contagious disease, to find effective means of containment and treatment of the disease, for now, and in future.
32317205,In the current paper, we describe our successful treatment of three COVID-19 pneumonia patients cases including severe cases and cases with mortality risk factors.
32317220,Several efforts are currently made to find a treatment for COVID-19 patients.
32317220,The anti-viral aspect of immunosuppressants towards a variety of viruses has been known since long time and it is herein discussed in the view of searching for a potential treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32317225,He was successfully treated in the intensive care unit with mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for respiratory support; and antiretroviral treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir.
32317267,Epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory characteristics and treatment and outcomes data were obtained through data collection forms from electronic medical records, and the relation between clinical data and disease severity was analysed. 3497 respiratory, stool, serum, and urine samples were collected from patients after admission and evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 RNA viral load.
32317402,Our current treatment protocol appears to be associated with favorable outcomes, but longer follow-up of a larger cohort of patients is needed.
32317408,In the absence of approved marketed drugs against coronaviruses, the treatment and management of this novel CoV disease (COVID-19) worldwide is a challenge.
32317557,As COVID-19 cases surge worldwide, an urgent need exists to enhance our understanding of the role of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in the management of severely ill patients with COVID-19 who develop acute respiratory and cardiac compromise refractory to conventional therapy.
32317557,Adjunctive medication in the surviving patients while on ECMO was as follows: 4 of 5 survivors received intravenous steroids, 3 of 5 survivors received antiviral medications (Remdesivir), 2 of 5 survivors were treated with anti-interleukin-6-receptor monoclonal antibodies (Tocilizumab or Sarilumab), and 1 of 5 survivors received hydroxychloroquine.An analysis of 32 COVID-19 patients with severe pulmonary compromise supported with ECMO suggests that ECMO may play a useful role in salvaging select critically ill patients with COVID-19.
32317558,The diagnosis was established through a remote interaction with the patient after early discharge from outpatient therapy due to upcoming traveling restrictions.
32317808,The clinical knowledge about the course, complications and treatment of COVID-19 in children and adolescents is so far limited.
32317810,It will help in designing a probiotic-based diet for modulation of the gut microbiome, and that could be another plausible prophylactic treatment option.
32317810,Hence, the experiences from the clinical intervention for that region should be considered in control and treatment strategies.
32318324,For example, treatment with iron chelator deferiprone has been shown to prolong the survival of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients.

32319129,Optimal disease control of allergic, asthmatic and immunodeficient children should be sought according to usual treatment guidelines.
32319218,In this report, we present a 77-year old patient with a heart transplant under relevant immunosuppressive therapy who was tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 after several days of dyspnoea, dry cough and light general symptoms.
32319218,The patient received an antiviral therapy with hydroxychloroquine showing no further deterioration of the clinical state.
32319424,Key messages include that supplemental oxygen is a first essential step for the treatment of severe COVID-19 patients with hypoxemia and should be a primary focus in resource-limited settings where capacity for invasive ventilation is limited.
32319436,In the case of CoViD-19, we must rely on professionals: it is not the time for the anticipated treatment plan, for self-determination.
32319443,The document, which aims to propose treatment decision-making criteria in the face of exceptional imbalances between health needs and available resources, has produced strong reactions, within the medical-scientific community, in the academic world, and in the media.
32319444,The shortage of intensive care units (ICU) beds and ventilators for the treatment of patients with severe respiratory failure produced angst in the clinicians/intensivists who have to decide which patients admit to ICU and in which patients to implement palliative care.
32319444,The patients not admitted to ICU due to clinical reasons and advanced stage diseases should receive a high quality palliative care, to obtain a good symptoms control (mainly dyspnea, anxiety and delirium) and to implement palliative sedation at the end of life.
32319447,At the end of the bibliographic survey there is the current absence of evidence of efficacy in favor of vitamin D in the treatment of coronavirus infection in its various expressions.
32319971,Due to the lack of current effective treatment and vaccine for COVID-19, screening, rapid diagnosis and isolation of the patients are essential (1, 2).
32320003,Clinical outcomes during hospitalization, such as invasive mechanical ventilation, kidney replacement therapy, and death.
32320003,During hospitalization, 373 patients (14.2%) (median age, 68 years [IQR, 56-78]; 33.5% female) were treated in the intensive care unit care, 320 (12.2%) received invasive mechanical ventilation, 81 (3.2%) were treated with kidney replacement therapy, and 553 (21%) died.
32320066,All these indicate that more detailed criteria are needed for the treatment and the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.
32320359,Only 17.7% of respondents took prevention and 45.0% of skin injuries were treated. <b>Innovation:</b> This is the first cross-sectional survey to understand skin injuries in medical staff caused by PPE, which is expected to be a benchmark. <b>Conclusion:</b> The skin injuries among medical staff are serious, with insufficient prevention and treatment.
32320375,Emerging infectious diseases by their nature, pose new challenges to the diagnostic-treatment-control nexus, and push our concepts of causality beyond the limits of the conventional Koch-Henle approach to aetiology.
32320381,A poor understanding of the disease among health care workers (HCWs) may result in delayed treatment and result in the rapid spread of the infection.
32320384,CP was also utilized for the treatment of one severe COVID-19 patient.
32320477,As chloroquine (CHQ) is part of the Dutch Centre for Infectious Disease Control coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) experimental treatment guideline, pediatric dosing guidelines are needed.
32320478,The findings in animals are inconsistent with respect to an increase in ACE2 expression in response to treatment with ACEIs or ARBs.
32320494,A survey was distributed to an expert panel of 37 pediatric dermatologists on the PDCRTF to assess expert opinion and current practice related to three primary domains of systemic therapy: initiation, continuation, and laboratory monitoring.
32320494,In asymptomatic patients, continuing therapy was the most popular choice across all medications queried.
32320494,The ultimate decision regarding initiation, continuation, and laboratory monitoring of immunosuppressive therapy during the pandemic requires careful deliberation, consideration of the little evidence available, and discussion with families.
32320494,Consideration of an individual's adherence to COVID-19 preventive measures, risk of exposure, and the potential severity if infected must be weighed against the dermatological disease, medication, and risks to the patient of tapering or discontinuing therapies.
32320506,Proning has become a standard treatment in the management of patients with ARDS who have difficulty achieving adequate oxygen saturation.
32320516,Here, we summarized the current known knowledge regarding epidemiological, pathogenesis, pathology, clinical features, comorbidities and treatment of COVID-19/ SARS-CoV-2 as reference for the prevention and control COVID-19.

32321878,The recent clinical trial reports pertaining to the efficacy of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine against COVID-19 albeit yet to be validated with larger clinical trials, have sparked much interest globally to evaluate whether this anti-malarial drug can be repurposed for the treatment of COVID-19.
32321878,Based on our data obtained from an animal infection model of melioidosis (a disease caused by the bacteria Burkholderia pseudomallei), treatment with chloroquine can result in the phosphorylation and consequent inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β).
32321905,In late March and early April 2020, the antimalarial drug, chloroquine, has been approved as an emergency treatment for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the United States and in Europe.
32321905,Although infrequent, neuropsychiatric symptoms have been reported in patients who received chloroquine for the treatment of malaria or autoimmune diseases.
32321905,Current pharmacovigilance study results did not suggest any potential link between the use of chloroquine and an increased risk of suicide, psychosis, confusion, and agitation, which would be informative during the emergency use of chloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19.
32322046,The prevalence of malnutrition in elderly patients with COVID-19 was high, and nutritional support should be strengthened during treatment, especially for those with diabetes mellitus, low calf circumference, or low albumin.
32322400,Although much is still unknown about SARS-CoV-2, the scientific research is moving at an unprecedented pace towards understanding the nature, effective control, prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2.

32322478,Oral and IV glutathione, glutathione precursors (N-acetyl-cysteine) and alpha lipoic acid may represent a novel treatment approach for blocking NFKappaB and addressing &quot;cytokine storm syndrome&quot; and respiratory distress in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.
32322758,Previous to the pandemic we commonly utilized total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) with a strong preference for long course chemoradiation (LCCRT).
32322758,In the setting of the ongoing pandemic we now mandate short course radiation therapy (SCRT).
32322988,The general and special emergency management was optimized for the efficient treatment of COVID-19-positive patients and the staff were trained in the use of protective equipment.
32323279,In this context, it was suspected that therapy with RAS blockers might promote transmission and complications of COVID-19 by upregulation of ACE2 expression.
32323287,Against the background of the pandemic caused by infection with the SARS-CoV-2, the German Society for Pneumology and Respiratory Medicine (DGP e.V.), in cooperation with other associations, has designated a team of experts in order to answer the currently pressing questions about therapy strategies in dealing with COVID-19 patients suffering from acute respiratory insufficiency (ARI).
32323287,Supply continuum for the treatment of ARIKey points have been highlighted as core statements and significant observations.
32323287,This distinction can be taken into consideration in the differential instrumentation in the therapy of ARI.The assessment of the extent of ARI should be carried out by an arterial or capillary blood gas analysis under room air conditions and must include the calculation of the oxygen supply (measured from the variables of oxygen saturation, the Hb value, the corrected values of the Hüfner number and the cardiac output).
32323287,If the specifications for protective equipment (eye protection, FFP2 or FFP-3 mask, gown) are adhered to, inhalation therapy, nasal high-flow (NHF) therapy, CPAP therapy or NIV can be carried out according to the current state of knowledge without increased risk of infection to the staff.
32323287,In this situation, CPAP/NIV therapy can be administered under use of a mouth and nose mask or a respiratory helmet as therapy escalation, as long as the criteria for endotracheal intubation are not fulfilled.In acute hypoxemic respiratory insufficiency, NIV should be performed in an intensive care unit or in a comparable unit by personnel with appropriate expertise.
32323460,Solid organ transplantation represents a field with a high demand on staff, intensive care units, and follow-up facilities.
32323646,Hydroxychloroquine is mainly used as a therapy for autoimmune diseases.
32323646,However, the efficacy and safety of CQ/HCQ for the treatment of COVID-19 remains to be defined.
32323646,Indiscriminate promotion and widespread use of CQ/HCQ have led to extensive shortages, self-treatment, and fatal overdoses.
32323974,Thus, this assay can achieve rapid and sensitive detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in human serum and allow positive identification in suspicious cases; it can also be useful for monitoring the progression COVID-19 and evaluating patients' response to treatment.

32324352,This paper discusses the possible effects of comedication on COVID-19 and the current treatment options for this infection.
32324352,Currently, chloroquine and remdesivir are possible treatment options.
32324352,There is no sound evidence for either treatment.
32324352,The treatment should be reconsidered in the event of side effects and when inferior medication for comorbidity must be prescribed because of possible interactions.
32324352,Supportive care is at present the mainstay of the treatment.
32324357,These challenges are the most critical in the field of intensive treatment and anesthesiology.
32324357,One of the most important prerequisites of effective critical care treatment is preserving the involved healthcare workers from the infection, by providing them with detailed practical advices on the preventive measures and treatment strategies.
32324359,In addition to the epidemiologic interventions aiming the deceleration of the outbreak, the early identification and the correct hospital treatment remain key issues since these may influence mortality.
32324361,There is currently no proven effective therapy for COVID-19.
32324361,Here we discuss the drugs most investigated for the treatment of the disease.
32324361,However, due to the severe healthcare effects of the pandemic and the potentially fatal outcome of COVID-19 patients treated in the intensive care units, their off-label use should none-the-less be considered.
32324364,The purpose of this summary is to present the practical aspects of anesthetic and perioperative care for patients requiring surgical treatment.
32324365,The best treatment is early endotracheal intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation.
32324366,In recent years, CytoSorb-haemoperfusion to remove cytokines has shown promising results in the treatment of septic shock.
32324533,In animal experiments, estrogen treatment silences the inflammatory reactions and decreases virus titers leading to improved survival rate; it seems to be an ideal prevention and therapy against COVID-19.
32324533,We should overcome the widespread reluctance to estrogen therapy as we have a unique estrogen formula; conjugated estrogens, or conjugated equine estrogens available under the brand name of Premarin deriving from natural sources.
32324898,Together, the incidence of ADRs was significantly high during the treatment period.
32324898,Moreover, the active monitoring of the CHPS system reflected ADRs during COVID-19 treatment in the real world, which provided reference for safe medication in the clinic.
32324951,There is no effective vaccine or approved drug treatment against COVID-19 and other pathogenic coronaviruses.
32324985,In this article, besides providing a summary of literature, we would also like to make practical recommendations which may increase the safety of healthcare providers participating in the treatment or pathological duties with COVID-19 suspected, probable and confirmed cases.

32325096,Data from manikin studies indicates that donning of personal protective equipment delays treatment delivery.
32325124,This article examines three aspects of antivirals, such as hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, and remdesvir, as they might relate to the treatment of a viral infection such as COVID-19: (i) the use of vaporization for the delivery of antivirals, with the bulk constituents having mild antiviral efficacy; (ii) the application of a marine natural product extract as opposed to a single molecule as an antiviral agent; and (iii) a counter intuitive approach to formulation that is, in part, based on delivering multiple species that fall into three categories: building blocks for the virus to accelerate replication; an energy source for the infected cell to boost its immune response; and the species that antagonize or provide toxicity to the virus.
32325167,Hospital palliative care is an essential part of the COVID-19 response but data are lacking.
32325167,We identified symptom burden, management, response to treatment, and outcomes for a case series of 101 inpatients with confirmed COVID-19 referred to hospital palliative care.
32325167,Patients spent a median [IQR] of 2 [1-4] days under the palliative care team, who made 3 [2-5] contacts across patient, family, and clinicians.
32325167,At March 30, 2020, 75 patients had died; 13 been discharged back to team, home, or hospice; and 13 continued to receive inpatient palliative care.
32325167,Palliative care is an essential component to the COVID-19 response, and teams must rapidly adapt with new ways of working.
32325167,An international minimum data set for palliative care would accelerate finding answers to new questions as the COVID-19 pandemic develops.
32325252,Lack of targeted therapy continues to be a problem.
32325767,While novel vaccines and drugs that target SARS-CoV-2 are under development, this review provides information on therapeutics which are under clinical trials or are proposed to antagonize SARS-CoV-2.
32325888,A large number of dentists (90%) were aware of recent changes in the treatment protocols.
32325888,However, execution of amended treatment protocol was recorded as 61%.
32325888,A number of dental practices have either modified their services according to the recommended guidelines to emergency treatment only or closed down practices for an uncertain period.
32326343,While great resources are understandably being dedicated to treatment and diagnosis, more efforts could be dedicated to limit the virus spread.
32326426,If chlorhexidine, a usual component of mouth rinse, is not efficient to kill SARS-CoV-2, the use of a mouth rinses and/or with local nasal applications that contain β-cyclodextrins combined with flavonoids agents, such as Citrox, could provide valuable adjunctive treatment to reduce the viral load of saliva and nasopharyngeal microbiota, including potential SARS-CoV-2 carriage.
32326509,Technical and logistical issues arise when establishing such a non-standardized treatment into clinical practice with safety and proper governance.
32326602,This constant transmission of a novel coronavirus and its ability to spread from human to human have prompted scientists to develop new approaches for treatment of COVID-19.
32326602,Here, we systemically discuss the pharmacological therapeutics targeting RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), proteinase and S protein for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32326602,In addition, we will discuss the viability and challenges in targeting RdRp and proteinase, and application of natural product quinoline and its analog chloroquine for treatment of coronavirus infection.

32327293,With the emergence of the COVID-19 virus and considering the lack of effective pharmaceutical treatment for it, there is an urgent need to identify safe and effective drugs or potential adjuvant therapy in this regard.
32327383,Ultrasound, although not used in the diagnosis of COVID-19 may be utilised by practitioners at the point of care (POC) or on the intensive care units (ITUs) where rapid assessment of the lung condition may be required.
32327397,Risks of treatment include QT segment prolongation, Torsades de Pointes (TdP), and death.
32327490,The recommendations focus on administration of as much care as possible at home to keep people with epilepsy out of health care facilities, where they are likely to encounter COVID-19 (including strategies for rescue therapy), as well as minimization of risk of seizure exacerbation through adherence, and through ensuring a regular supply of medication.
32327746,To mark the tenth anniversary of anti-IL-6 receptor therapy worldwide, we discuss the history of research into IL-6 biology and the development of therapies that target IL-6 signalling, including the successes and challenges and with an emphasis on rheumatic diseases.
32327870,However, there is very scarce information on the management of thrombotic risk, coagulation disorders, and anticoagulant therapy.
32327870,This article by the Working Group on Cardiovascular Thrombosis of the Spanish Society of Cardiology aims to summarize the available information and to provide a practical approach to the management of antithrombotic therapy.
32327904,Many of the medications used for treatment of COVID-19 can also be associated with GI symptoms or liver injury and can be included in the differential diagnosis in these patients.
32328206,This is particularly so for peritoneal neoplastic diseases, for which curative treatment mobilizes substantial personnel, operating room and intensive care resources.
32328206,It is desirable to prioritize disease conditions for which cytoreduction surgery with or without associated hyperthermic intraoperative peritoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) is the gold-standard treatment, and for which systemic chemotherapy cannot be a temporary or long-term alternative: pseudomyxoma peritonei, resectable malignant peritoneal mesotheliomas, peritoneal metastases of colorectal origin if they are resectable and unresponsive to systemic chemotherapy after up to 12 courses, first-line ovarian carcinomatosis if resectable or in interval surgery after at most six courses of systemic chemotherapy.

32328595,The protocol is designed for a hospital setting and includes considerations related to dental treatment in both healthy subjects and those suspected or diagnosed with COVID-19.
32328757,Other important measures include triaging of patients to identify those at the greatest risk of irreversible vision loss and prioritization of treatment visits over monitoring visits where possible.
32328757,In order to limit patient exposure, ophthalmologists should refrain from using treatment regimens that require frequent monitoring.
32328850,When it comes to treatment, specific drugs for COVID-19 have not been found at present, and taking old drugs for new use in treating COVID-19 has become an emergency method for the pandemic.
32329046,This evidence, together with the experience of the authors in the management of patients with multiple sclerosis during the pandemic, will make it possible to offer some proposals for the treatment and follow-up of patients in this epidemiological context.
32329046,After the literature search and our experience in the management of patients, a number of proposals for treatment are established for each drug, which must necessarily be individualised for each patient, since, in these exceptional circumstances, their peculiarities can affect the prognosis.
32329231,A series of patients managed in the Cremona Thrombosis Center were admitted at Cremona Hospital for SARS-CoV-2 and started antiviral drugs without stopping DOAC therapy.
32329231,Plasma samples for DOAC measurement were collected 2to 4 days after starting antiviral treatment, at 12 hours from the last dose intake in patients on dabigatran and apixaban, and at 24 hours in those on rivaroxaban and edoxaban.
32329231,Of the 1039 patients hospitalized between February 22 and March 15, 2020 with COVID-19 pneumonia and candidates for antiviral therapy, 32 were on treatment with a DOAC.
32329246,Prophylaxis treatment of COVID-19 patients with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is important to limit coagulopathy.
32329246,In this review, we discuss the repurposing of fibrinolytic drugs, namely tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), to treat COVID-19 associated ARDS. tPA is an approved intravenous thrombolytic treatment, and the nebulizer form has been shown to be effective in plastic bronchitis and is currently in Phase II clinical trial.
32329275,All articles were categorized into epidemiology, clinical diagnosis and treatment, basic research, pregnant women and children, mental health, epidemic prevention &amp; control, and others.
32329276,In this review we introduce these research works related to spike proteins, hoping it will provide reasonable ideas for the control of the current pandemic, as well as for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.
32329404,Early reports of potential treatment for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have raised concerns related to pharmaceutical distribution.
32329419,The lack of availability of approved treatment for this disease calls forth the scientific community to find novel compounds with the ability to treat it.
32329520,No specific therapies/vaccines are yet available for the treatment of COVID-19.
32329563,Further studies are needed to better investigate the causes of liver injury in patients with COVID-19 disease and the effect of treatment for COVID-19 on the liver.
32329659,Concerns about the prevention and management of COVID-19 are on the rise, as it is crucial in contagious epidemics that travel and transfer of the patients be minimal for diagnosis, treatment, and follow-ups.
32329877,Additionally, we have discussed various therapeutic strategies for COVID-19 under different categories, like the possible treatment plans with drug (antiviral drugs and anti-cytokines) therapy for disease prevention.
32329877,Collectively, the review provides an overview of the SARS-CoV-2 infection outbreak along with the recent advancements and strategies for diagnosis and therapy of COVID-19.
32329879,However, the current treatment options include hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab, remdesivir, lopinavir-ritonavir (Kaletra®), and nitazoxanide.
32329881,In this case series, we aimed to report preliminary data obtained with anti-complement C5 therapy with eculizumab in COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) of ASL Napoli 2 Nord.
32329881,Patients were also treated with anticoagulant therapy with Enoxaparin 4000 IU/day via subcutaneous injection, antiviral therapy with Lopinavir 800 mg/day + Ritonavir 200 mg/day, hydroxychloroquine 400 mg/day, ceftriaxone 2 g/day IV, vitamine C 6 g/day for 4 days, and were on Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV).
32329881,All patients successfully recovered after treatment with eculizumab.
32329881,Eculizumab has the potential to be a key player in treatment of severe cases of COVID-19.
32329881,Our results support eculizumab use as an off-label treatment of COVID-19, pending confirmation from the ongoing SOLID-C19 trial.
32329920,We highlight the importance of collaborative treatment decisions between the patient, family, and health-care provider, considering any geographic or institution-specific policies and precautions for COVID-19.
32329921,We emphasize the importance of collaborative treatment decisions between the patient, family, and healthcare provider, considering any geographic- or institution-specific policies and precautions for COVID-19.
32329924,In the context of COVID-19, cancer survivors represent a particularly vulnerable population that may be &quot;doubly hit&quot; by both costs of cancer treatment and financial strain imposed by the pandemic.
32329930,Allergen-specific immunotherapy (AIT) is one of the most important treatment options for IgE-mediated allergies and is based on immunological effects on the diseased patient.
32329953,Patients with oral cancer are susceptible often immunosuppressed due to the disease and/or the treatment received.
32329953,Stage IV patients with oral cancer who did not receive treatment had progression of disease and an increased mortality rate compared to patients who receive treatment but did not contract COVID-19.
32329953,The patients who received treatment and got affected with COVID-19 had a far worse impact and higher mortality rate than all other groups.
32329953,Isolation and deferring treatment for stage IV patients with oral cancer, so as to avoid hospital visits and contraction of COVID-19, is an advisable strategy based on this model.
32329958,Multidisciplinary conferences (MDC) are an important component of head and neck oncologic care including diagnosis, treatment, and survivorship.
32330073,While of high utility in the management of HAPE and acute mountain sickness, systemically delivered pulmonary vasodilators and acetazolamide should not be used in the treatment of COVID-19, as they carry the risk of multiple adverse consequences including worsened ventilation-perfusion matching, impaired carbon dioxide transport, systemic hypotension and increased work of breathing.
32330124,With the current rapid spread of COVID-19, global health systems are increasingly overburdened by the sheer number of people that need diagnosis, isolation and treatment.
32330124,Here, we summarise community-driven approaches based on Free and Open Source scientific and medical Hardware (FOSH) as well as personal protective equipment (PPE) currently being developed and deployed to support the global response for COVID-19 prevention, patient treatment and diagnostics.
32330208,Such major viral outbreaks demand early elucidation of taxonomic classification and origin of the virus genomic sequence, for strategic planning, containment, and treatment.
32330277,There is no specific antiviral therapy recommended for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32330277,Data presented here refer primarily to safety and lethality outcomes during treatment on day 13.
32330288,With the developing COVID-19 pandemic, patients with inherited anaemias require specific advice regarding isolation and changes to usual treatment schedules.
32330288,Cascading of accurate information for clinicians and patients is paramount to preventing adverse outcomes, such as patients who are at increased risk of fulminant bacterial infection due to their condition or its treatment erroneously self-isolating if their fever is mistakenly attributed to a viral cause, delaying potentially life-saving antibiotic therapy.
32330293,This patient had recovered from the pneumonia after treatment.
32330303,A combination of nucleic acid and IgM-IgG testing is a more sensitive and accurate approach for diagnosis and early treatment of COVID-19.
32330313,The puerpera returned to normal after the operation and two times of throat swab COVID-19 nucleic acid test were all negative after antiviral therapy.
32330521,Presently, no approved treatment or prophylaxis is available for COVID-19.
32330817,Bedside clinicians abstracted daily patient data on history, treatment, and short-term course.
32330817,We describe management and a proposed severity scale for treatment used in this hospital. 44 patients were enrolled; with incomplete information on 11.
32330817,Patients also received lopinivir/ritonavir (82%), hydroxychloroquine (79%), and tocilizumab (12%) according to this treatment algorithm.
32330858,The COVID-19 pandemic demands reassessment of head and neck oncology treatment paradigms.
32330858,Additionally, novel, COVID-19-specific multilevel risks to HNC patients, HCWs and institutions, and society include: use of immunosuppressive therapy, nosocomial COVID-19 transmission, institutional COVID-19 outbreaks, and, at some locations, societal resource deficiencies requiring health care rationing.
32330858,Until these risks are managed, we temporarily favor nonsurgical therapy over surgery for most mucosal squamous cell carcinomas, wherein surgery and nonsurgical therapy are both first-line options.
32330970,This case report describes successful treatment of preterm labor during acute COVID-19 infection.
32330970,Standard treatment for preterm labor may allow patients with acute COVID-19 infection to recover without the need for preterm delivery.
32330970,· Standard treatment for preterm labor such as intravenous magnesium sulfate, antepartum steroid therapy and antibiotic prophylaxis for group B streptococcus infection were effective in this patient..
32331217,Here, we discuss the rationale and some important considerations about timing, criteria, and monitoring requirements for patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure requiring a CPAP treatment.
32331255,In this context, the present review article provides a cumulative account of the recent information regarding the viral characteristics, potential therapeutic targets, treatment options, and prospective research questions.
32331343,In addition to this first aspect, the recent evidence of an increased frequency of venous thromboembolism in patients with COVID-19 (a clinical element associated with a worse prognosis) calls the attention on the safety of treatment with testosterone, in particular in hypogonadal men with greater genetic predisposition.
32332319,We illustrate the symptoms initiation, the laboratory test results, the imaging examination, and the treatment strategy in the duration of COVID-19 with a timeline chart.
32332765,As these fusion proteins exhibit cross-reactivity against coronaviruses, they have potential applications in the diagnosis, prophylaxis, and treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
32333185,We focus on multiple levels of intervention including intrapersonal, interpersonal, community, and social factors, each of which provide a reference point for understanding and elaborating on social/behavioral lessons learned from HIV prevention and treatment research.
32333185,The investments in HIV prevention and treatment research far outweigh any infectious disease in the history of public health, that is, until now with the emergence of COVID-19.
32333196,As we know more about the clinical and laboratory features of COVID-19, which is now accepted as a pandemic, many questions have been raised about how to manage and monitor the treatment of cancer patients.
32333196,This article was written for a hypothetical approach in cancer patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in order to be an idea of collecting data for treatment with anti-cancer drugs that cause lymphopenia.
32333248,In the early February, 2020, we called up an experts' committee with more than 30 Chinese experts from 11 national medical academic organizations to formulate the first edition of consensus statement on diagnosis, treatment and prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children, which has been published in this journal.
32333248,With accumulated experiences in the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 in children, we have updated the consensus statement and released the second edition recently.
32333248,The current version in English is a condensed version of the second edition of consensus statement on diagnosis, treatment and prevention of COVID-19 in children.
32333248,This version of experts consensus will be valuable for better prevention, diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 in children worldwide.
32333293,As hospital resources and staff become more limited during the COVID-19 pandemic, it becomes critically important to define which BC patients require more urgent care and which patients can wait for treatment until the pandemic is over.
32333293,Additionally, we provide treatment recommendations for each of these patient scenarios.
32333293,Priority A patients have conditions that are immediately life threatening or symptomatic requiring urgent treatment.
32333293,Priority B patients have conditions that do not require immediate treatment but should start treatment before the pandemic is over.
32333293,Physicians should use these recommendations to prioritize care for their BC patients and adapt treatment recommendations to the local context at their hospital.
32333494,Nevertheless, genetic factors in different ethnic groups often contribute to disease severity and treatment response.
32333494,Finally, if a link to genetic variations in the androgen receptor and COVID-19 disease severity can be established, it would suggest new treatment options.
32333552,Movement disorder (Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, dystonia), neuropsychiatric disorder (obsessive compulsive disorder, Tourette syndrome, depression), and epilepsy patients can develop varying degrees of symptom worsening from interruption of therapy due to neurostimulator battery reaching end of life, device malfunction or infection.
32333552,Similarly, patients with generalized dystonia can develop status dystonicus, patients with obsessive compulsive disorder can become suicidal, and epilepsy patients can experience potentially life-threatening worsening of seizures as a result of therapy cessation.
32333552,The decision for replacement of the implantable pulse generator to prevent interruption of DBS therapy should be made on a case-by-case basis taking into consideration battery status and a patient's tolerance to potential therapy disruption.
32333601,We further hypothesized that their expression could be affected by inflammation or medication usage.
32333601,Patients with IBD do not have higher expression during inflammation; medical therapy is associated with lower levels of ACE2.
32333823,Corticosteroids and non-steroid immunomodulatory agents are the mainstays of treatment.
32333823,Treatment can be challenging particularly in pemphigus, mucous membrane pemphigoid, and epidermolysis bullosa acquisita which may require more intense immunosuppressive approaches.
32333929,Major issues for patients with ILD will include restricted access to key components of the diagnostic process, new uncertainties in the use of common ILD pharmacotherapies, limited ability to monitor both disease severity and the presence of medication adverse effects, and significantly curtailed research activities.
32334062,There is currently no specific treatment available for patients with COVID-19 infection.
32334062,Numerous potential therapies, including supportive intervention, immunomodulatory agents, antiviral therapy, and convalescent plasma transfusion, have been tentatively applied in clinical settings.
32334158,The present day is dominated by studies on determining the factors that affect, taking preventive actions, and trying to find an effective treatment on top priority.
32334163,Unani is a traditional system of medicine developed during the middle ages, which employs natural drugs of herbal, animal and mineral origin for treatment.
32334182,To improve this, public health officials should provide a timely, clear rationale for quarantine and information about protocols; emphasise social norms to encourage this altruistic behaviour; increase the perceived benefit that engaging in quarantine will have on public health; and ensure that sufficient supplies of food, medication and other essentials are provided.
32334502,To date, no definitive treatment orvaccine application exists for COVID-19.
32334502,Although new investigations seek to repurpose existingantiviral treatments for COVID-19, innovative treatment strategies not normally considered tohave antiviral capabilities may be critical to address this global concern.
32334502,One such avenue that mayprove to be exceedingly fruitful and offer exciting potential as new antiviral therapy involves themechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and its associated pathways of mTOR Complex 1(mTORC1), mTOR Complex 2 (mTORC2), and AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK).
32334502,Yet, important considerationsfor the development of safe and effective antiviral therapy with mTOR pathways exist.
32334535,We here discuss this concern in relation to headache treatment and conclude that, based on current evidence, there is no reason to abandon treatment of headache patients with RAS inhibitors or ibuprofen.
32334800,As the global incidence of COVID-19 disease is increasing dramatically, health systems worldwide started to suffer in terms of its capability to manage affected people and the ability to provide standard treatment for critically ill patients in a safe environment.
32334905,In the radiotherapy department of Mulhouse hospital (France), we pointed five points out: protection of medical and paramedical staff, protection of patients undergoing treatment, detection of patients suspected of being infected by SARS-CoV-2 and their management, reorganization of the patient circuit and measures regarding the quality management.
32335097,It has been hypothesized that DPP4 inhibition, a therapy currently available for type 2 diabetes, might represent a target for decreasing the risk of the acute respiratory complications of the COVID-19 infection but (1) lack of demonstration of SARS-CoV2 binding to DPP4 (2) possible protective role of sDPP4 in Middle East respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) (3) demonstrated inhibition and downregulation of DPP4 by HIV1 and MERS-CoV and (4) not exclusive role of the receptor binding in tropism of the Coronavirus family, support that DPP4 inhibition at present doesn't represent a plausible approach to mitigate COVID-19.
32335281,This brief article discusses the therapeutic potential of glycyrrhizin for the treatment of COVID-19 from the perspective of its pharmacological action, including binding angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2), downregulating proinflammatory cytokines, inhibiting the accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), inhibiting thrombin, inhibiting the hyperproduction of airway exudates, and inducing endogenous interferon.

32337790,The clinical course was complicated by extreme overexposure to the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor everolimus, following coadministration of chloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir therapy.
32337790,The case is illustrative for dilemmas that transplant professionals may face in the absence of evidence-based COVID-19 therapy and concurrent pressure for exploration of experimental pharmacological treatment options.
32337790,However, the risk-benefit balance of experimental or off-label therapy may be weighed differently in organ transplant recipients than in otherwise healthy COVID-19 patients, owing to their immunocompromised status and potential drug interactions with immunosuppressive therapy.
32337790,With this case report, we aimed to achieve increased awareness and improved management of drug-drug interactions associated with the various treatment options for COVID-19 in renal transplant patients.
32338155,Anti-malarial medicine chloroquine (CQ) and particularly its chemical analogue hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have been recommended as promising candidate therapeutics that are now under either compassionate off-label use or clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.
32338155,Given the fact that for decades HCQ has been approved as an immunomodulatory drug for the long term treatment of chronic rheumatic diseases, as experienced rheumatologists, we would like to share our thoughts in this regard and trigger a brainstorm among clinical care providers for exchanging their diverse opinions on this urgent topic.

32341442,Until further data are available, it is recommended that ARB and ACEI medications be continued for the treatment of patients with cardiovascular disease and hypertension, especially those at high risk, according to guideline-directed medical therapy based on the currently available evidence.
32341630,Currently no vaccine is available and treatment is mainly supportive.
32341718,But for Hubei Province, the subjects of Wuhan City and Hubei Province were included from the time of admission to the Huoshenshan Hospital to present day in order to ensure that all or the majority of the confirmed and suspected patients were collected for diagnosis and treatment.
32341721,The reasons for hospitalization were: surgical treatment of cancer (n = 5), complex emergencies (n = 5), treatment of complications linked to cancer or its treatment (n = 3), gastroplasty (n = 1), and stoma closure (n = 1).
32341910,Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have been used as treatment and are being considered as prophylaxis.

32342541,Options for alternative treatment modalities are provided if surgical treatment needs to be deferred.
32342609,Both patients reported clinically meaningful benefits from nVNS therapy.
32342676,As COVID-19 has such varied clinical manifestations and case fatality rates, no standard antiviral therapy regimen has been established other than supportive therapy.
32342677,Since clinical feature of COVID-19 has not been fully evaluated yet, empirical antibacterial agents are frequently combined for the treatment of COVID-19 in addition to antiviral agents, concerning co-existing bacterial pathogens.
32342863,In that same scenario, postponement or interruption of radiotherapy treatment of COVID-19 positive patients is generally recommended to avoid exposure of cancer patients and staff to an increased risk of COVID-19 infection.
32342863,Case-specific consensus recommendations regarding multimodality treatment strategies and fractionation of radiotherapy are provided.
32342870,Under its lead, the following measures were implemented in the radiation oncology department: the radiotherapy clinic was divided into different infection control zones with varying levels of protection; special staff and patient infection control training sessions were conducted and appropriate measures deployed; daily symptom testing criteria were implemented for patients undergoing treatment; special rotating schedules and infection control methods were implemented for various staff members such as medical physicists/dosimetrists and radiation therapists; modified radiotherapy workflow and specialized treatment area cleaning and disinfection policies and procedures were designed and executed; and special medical waste disposal methods were implemented.

32343419,Over the period of operation, a total of 1,124 patients were admitted for treatment.
32343423,While this makes financial sense, from a medical perspective our population will be left defenseless in the absence of a viable treatment strategy for SARS-CoV-2.
32343428,Third, when the second and third clusters could not find infectious sources, CECC's press conference let the public know immediately the epidemic situation, so that people could raise their awareness and seek medical treatment or quarantine.
32343444,Elderly patients with head and neck cancer are at increased risk of adverse outcomes during and after treatment of head and neck cancer.
32343444,In many cases, prudent treatment plan modification may allow for overall best outcomes.
32343444,Furthermore, recruitment of social services and, when appropriate, palliative care, may allow for optimal management of these patients.
32343454,These changes raise a lot of questions regarding patient triage and treatment decisions in clinical situations when it is unclear if the workup and management can be postponed.
32343658,These include virustatic agents that have already been approved for the treatment of other types of viral infection, as well as drugs that are currently used for entirely different purposes.
32343658,Because the virus enters human cells by way of the membrane-associated angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), keeping the virus from docking to this receptor is a conceivable treatment approach.
32343658,There is not yet any recommendation for the therapeutic use of any particular agent beyond standard supportive treatment.
32343745,Sex is an important biological variable that should be considered in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.
32343968,Anti-cytokine therapy such as tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor antagonist, is a potential treatment for COVID-19; however, data regarding the efficacy of this anti-IL-6 therapy are currently lacking.
32343968,Both patients progressed to sHLH despite treatment with tocilizumab, and one developed viral myocarditis, challenging the safety and clinical usefulness of tocilizumab in the treatment of COVID-19-induced CRS.
32344011,Treatment in intensive care units (ICU) has become a major challenge; therefore, early recognition of severe forms is absolutely essential for timely triaging of patients.
32344056,Eosinophil levels vary dramatically in a number of clinical settings, especially following eosinophil-targeted therapy, which is now available to selectively deplete these cells.
32344166,Here we provide an update for clinicians on the recent developments in the virology, diagnostics, clinical presentation, viral shedding, and treatment options for COVID-19 based on current literature.
32344166,We describe the virological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and the clinical course of COVID-19 with an emphasis on diagnostic challenges, duration of viral shedding, severity markers and current treatment options.
32344166,For improved management of cases, there is a need to understand test probability of serology, qRT-PCR and radiological testing, and the efficacy of available treatment options that could be used in severe cases with a high risk of mortality.
32344202,Vaccines that prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and therapeutics that reduces the risk of severe Covid-19 are thus urgently needed.
32344202,A rapid method to derive antiviral treatment for Covid-19 is the use of convalescent plasma derived hyperimmune globulin.
32344226,Despite great efforts, there is no treatment of this disease.
32344226,This article describes SARS-CoV-2, disease, prevention and management, treatment and social impact on society.
32344226,However, Unani therapy may be useful along with allopathic treatment.
32344304,Based on this observation, our proposed hypothesis is that 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors, that are commonly used for BPH treatment, may be one of the factors contributing to poorer prognosis in males.
32344310,Alternate treatment strategies utilizing clinically available treatments such as hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), packed red blood cell (pRBC) transfusions, or erthropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) therapy were hypothesized to increase oxygenation of tissues by alternative means than standard respiratory and ventilator treatments.
32344310,It was also revealed that alternative treatments currently being considered for COVID-19 such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine by increasing hemoglobin production and increasing hemoglobin availability for oxygen binding and acetazolamine (for the treatment of altitude sickness) by causing hyperventilation with associated increasing levels of oxygen and decreasing levels of carbon dioxide in the blood may significantly ameliorate COVID-19 respiratory symptoms.
32344310,In conclusion, is recommend, given HBOT, pRBC, and ESA therapies are currently available and routinely utilized in the treatment of other conditions, that such therapies be tried among COVID-19 patients with serious respiratory conditions and that future controlled-clinical trials explore the potential usefulness of such treatments among COVID-19 patients with respiratory conditions.
32344313,Despite the immense and ongoing global effort, no efficacious drugs to fight this plague have been identified and patients admitted to the intensive care units (ICU), for respiratory distress, are managed mostly by means of supportive care based on oxygen maintenance.
32344313,TZD were widely used for type-2 diabetes in the first decade of this century and although concerns have been raised for possible side effects associated with long-term treatment, their use has been recently revaluated for their anti-inflammatory properties in numerous medical conditions.
32344320,The dynamic levels of T lymphocyte in severe group were significantly lower from disease onset, but in the improved subgroup the value of T lymphocyte began to increase after about 15-day treatment and finally returned to the normal level.
32344438,Questions were addressing the following issues: impact on nuclear medicine diagnostics and therapy, use of recommendations, personal protective equipment, and organizational adaptations.
32344439,We also report on experiences with implementation of these approaches and treatment outcomes in the first 115 COVID patients.
32344439,A multidisciplinary Task-force Coronavirus initiated measures concerning outpatient testing and counseling, reorganisation and separation of patient flow processes alongside with substantial escalation of inpatient capacities on regular wards and intensive care units.
32344441,As such, clinical protocols and practice on labor and delivery units must adapt to optimize the safety of patients and health care workers and to better conserve health care resources.
32344444,For both, plastic and hand surgeons it is crucial to act responsible, minimize the transmission of the virus and aid in reasonable and adequate allocation of resources for the treatment of affected patients during this pandemia.
32344449,Hydroxychloroquine is an antimalarial drug being tested as a potential treatment for the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2( (SARS-CoV-2.
32344456,These recommendations focus on seven specific domains including: planning of resources and staffing; modifying the clinical environment; preparing equipment, supplies and drugs; selecting appropriate personal protective equipment; providing adequate oxygen therapy; assessing for and safely performing regional anaesthesia procedures; and monitoring during the conduct of anaesthesia and post-anaesthetic care.
32344469,So far, no causative therapy nor protective vaccines are available.
32344469,In this situation, useful prognostic parameters and targeted supportive treatment are urgently needed.
32344526,Previous evidence suggests that RAS may represent an important target for the treatment of lung pathologies, especially for acute respiratory distress syndrome and chronic fibrotic disease.
32344708,Since no specific therapy for these CoVs is available, any beneficial approach (including nutritional and dietary approach) is worth investigation.
32345226,We retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics and treatment progress of 91 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Jingzhou Central Hospital.
32345443,In view of the current pandemic by SARS-CoV-2 it deems essential to understand the key concepts about the infection: its epidemiological origin, presentation, clinical course, diagnosis and treatment (still experimental in many cases).
32345485,This convalescent plasma therapy is of particular interest when a vaccine or specific therapy is not yet available for emerging viruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19.
32345485,It also includes recommendations for establishing a convalescent plasma program, enhancement considerations for convalescent plasma, and considerations around pathogen reduction treatment of convalescent plasma.
32345485,The immediate use of convalescent plasma provides prompt availability of a promising treatment while specific vaccines and treatments are evaluated and brought to scale.
32345485,Further development of improved convalescent plasma, vaccines and other therapeutics depends on quick generation of additional data on pathogenesis and immune response.
32345864,Unprepared for this emergency, hospitals have quickly reformulated paths of assistance in an effort to guarantee treatment for infected patients.
32345864,Orthopaedic departments have been focused on elderly traumatology, especially the treatment of femoral neck fractures in patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19).
32345864,The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the orthopaedic management strategy for femoral fragility fractures in COVID-19-positive patients with the hypothesis that operative treatment may contribute to the overall stability of the patient.
32345864,Four patients who underwent surgical treatment died of respiratory failure on the first day after surgery (1 patient), the third day after surgery (2 patients), or the seventh day after surgery (1 patient).
32345864,We noted a stabilization of respiratory parameters in 12 COVID-19-positive patients who underwent surgery treatment of proximal femoral fractures.
32346392,This paper discusses the impact of coronavirus infection on cancer diagnosis and treatment in two leading cancer centres in Pakistan.
32346392,There is an urgent need to evaluate the effect of delays in diagnosis and treatment on cancer stage and treatment, and to decide how to minimise these during likely future cycles of lockdown over the coming months and years.
32346394,Cancer patients in conflict settings experience significant barriers in accessing chemotherapy and radiotherapy as well as palliative care and psychosocial support.
32346491,No specific treatment has been reported.
32346491,Herein, we examine the effects of Favipiravir (FPV) versus Lopinavir (LPV)/ritonavir (RTV) for the treatment of COVID-19.
32346491,In this open-label nonrandomized control study, FPV showed significantly better treatment effects on COVID-19 in terms of disease progression and viral clearance; if causal, these results should be important information for establishing standard treatment guidelines to combat the SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32346492,The second step is to prescribe a blood purification treatment for patients with COVID-19.
32346593,This paper reviews the published literature, guidelines and consensus, and summarizes the clinical and imaging characteristics of COVID-19, in order to provide a reliable basis for early diagnosis and treatment.
32346656,We implemented a novel remote RO SBRT coverage practice, requiring it to be reliable, of high audio and visual quality, timely, and the same level of specialty care as our current in-person treatment coverage practice.
32346656,The time from CBCT to treatment was calculated before and after implementation to determine timeliness of remote coverage.
32346656,Comfort levels with audio/visual communication as well as overall comfort in comparison to in-person RO coverage was evaluated using Likert scale surveys after treatment.
32346656,Remote RO SBRT coverage was successfully implemented in 14/15 fractions with 3 observed process failures that were all corrected before treatment.
32346656,Average times of pre-treatment coverage before and after implementation were 8.74 and 8.51min, respectively.
32346873,The demographic characteristics, clinical data, treatment, and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients without any symptoms were analyzed.
32347053,Since SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV are closely related, previous findings on SARS-CoV are highly relevant to a better understanding as well as diagnosis, treatment, prevention and control of SARS-CoV-2.
32347053,In this review, we highlight recent progresses in the field; compare the biological characteristics of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2; summarize the urgently-needed diagnostic, treatment, prevention and control options; and provide future perspectives for the outcome of the outbreak and research questions to be answered, including some of the difficulties in vaccine development.
32347201,Predictors of lower odds of discharge were age &gt; 65 years, antiviral treatment and for severe disease, lactate dehydrogenase &gt; 300 mg/dL.
32347453,The department of surgery played a leading role in establishing clinical protocols, guidelines, and policies in preparation for a surge of COVID-19 patients.
32347743,Small studies have shown a potential benefit of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine ± azithromycin for the treatment of COVID-19.
32347743,The maximum QTc during treatment was significantly longer in the combination group vs the monotherapy group (470.4 ± 45.0 ms vs.
32347743,Although use of these medications resulted in QT prolongation, clinicians seldomly needed to discontinue therapy.
32347745,The current outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 has and continues to put huge pressure on intensive care units (ICUs) worldwide.
32347761,For the dermatology community, this interruption to the healthcare system can lead to delays in the diagnosis and treatment of melanoma.
32347772,Identified strategies included early recognition of the threat and rapid activation of national response protocols led by national leadership; rapid establishment of diagnostic capacity; scale-up of measures for preventing community transmission; and redesigning the triage and treatment systems, mobilizing the necessary resources for clinical care.
32348003,Worldwide Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic makes the management of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) more complicated, effective treatment without further dissemination is thus quite challenging.
32348025,Furthermore, elective clinics and operations have been reduced in order to mobilize manpower to the acute specialties combatting the outbreak; appropriate differentiation between patients who require immediate care and those who can receive telephone consultation or whose treatment might viably be postponed is therefore crucial.
32348042,Furthermore, treatment options against COVID-19 disease and adequate adjustment of immunosuppression in at risk patients remain a concern.
32348043,Proper mitigation strategies in the clinic and use of less resource-heavy but equivalent treatment alternatives often allow optimal cancer care.
32348044,Thrombocytopenia and procoagulant state are associated with severe courses of COVID-19, requiring an individualized therapy.
32348046,Patients under immunosuppressive treatment are considered at high risk of severe outcome and are protected accordingly by the Swiss authorities.
32348046,However, current, scarce scientific evidence suggests that patients under immunosuppressive therapy do not necessarily develop severe COVID-19 presentations.
32348046,Therefore, the current guidelines recommend pursuing the treatment throughout the pandemic.
32348055,Up to 5 % of COVID-19 infected patients develop severe acute hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation as supportive treatment.
32348055,Apart from early antiviral and anti-inflammatory treatment, the management of COVID-19 patients is mainly applying protective mechanical ventilation, to support the injured lungs.
32348056,Alongside organizational challenges, clinical issues such as rapid respiratory distress, clinical suspicions with negative PCR and treatment uncertainties in the absence of sufficient evidence were overcome.
32348166,With the capability of inducing elevated expression of ACE2, the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2, angiotensin II receptor blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ARBs/ACEIs) treatment may have a controversial role in both facilitating virus infection and reducing pathogenic inflammation.
32348166,126 COVID-19 patients with preexisting hypertension at Hubei Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine (HPHTCM) in Wuhan from January 5 to February 22, 2020 were retrospectively allocated to ARBs/ACEIs group (n=43) and non-ARBs/ACEIs group (n=83) according to their antihypertensive medication. 125 age- and sex-matched COVID-19 patients without hypertension were randomly selected as non-hypertension controls.
32348166,In addition, the medication history of 1942 hypertension patients that were admitted to HPHTCM from November 1 to December 31, 2019 before COVID-19 outbreak were also reviewed for external comparison.
32348232,O2 saturation was 87% (without O2 therapy).
32348233,We report 3 patients with coronavirus disease who had a decline in respiratory status during their hospital course that responded well to intravenous steroids and interleukin-6 receptor antagonist therapy.
32348485,Currently, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been reported in almost all countries globally, and no effective therapy has been documented for COVID-19 and the role of convalescent plasma therapy is unknown.
32348485,In conclusion, convalescent plasma treatment can discontinue SARS-CoV-2 shedding but cannot reduce mortality in critically end-stage COVID-19 patients, and treatment should be initiated earlier.
32348554,We wish to bring your attention to the PsoPROTECT (Psoriasis Patient Registry for Outcomes, Therapy and Epidemiology of Covid-19 infecTion) and SECURE-AD (Surveillance Epidemiology of Coronavirus Under Research Exclusion-Atopic Dermatitis) registries; two urgent global initiatives that address an unmet need for delineating the determinants of COVID-19 outcomes in the common cutaneous immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) psoriasis and atopic dermatitis.
32348585,Imaging modalities such as chest radiography, thoracic and cardiovascular ultrasound, and computed tomography have roles in the diagnosis, prognosis, monitoring, and therapy of COVID-19.
32348588,Here, we provide an overview of the known clinical features and treatment options for COVID-19.
32348588,To date, there is no evidence of any effective treatment for COVID-19.
32348588,The main therapies being used to treat the disease are antiviral drugs, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and respiratory therapy.
32348588,Specifically designed randomized clinical trials are needed to determine the most appropriate evidence-based treatment modality.
32348598,IBD medication adherence should be encouraged to prevent disease flare but where possible high-dose systemic corticosteroids should be avoided.
32348598,The primary focus should remain on keeping bowel inflammation controlled and encouraging medication adherence.
32348692,Use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) was associated with lower expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, but treatment with triamcinolone acetonide (TA) did not decrease expression of either gene.
32348711,Palliative care is an important component of health care in pandemics, contributing to symptom control, psychological support, and supporting triage and complex decision making.
32348711,Concerns included scarcity of personal protective equipment, a lack of hospice-specific guidance on COVID-19, anxiety about needing to care for children and other relatives, and poor integration of palliative care in the acute planning response.
32348711,Governments must urgently recognise the essential contribution of hospice and palliative care to the COVID-19 pandemic and ensure these services are integrated into the health care system response.
32349032,Radiographic technologies and tools, including Computed tomography (CT) and Chest X-ray (CXR), were applied for initial screening and follow-up, from which provides detail diagnosis with specific pathologic features for staging and treatment arrangement.
32349053,With limited ability to contain the virus and relatively high transmissibility and case fatality rates, governmental institutions and pharmaceutical companies are racing to find therapeutics and vaccines that target this novel coronavirus.
32349053,This is another missed opportunity to obtain pregnancy-specific safety and efficacy data, because therapeutics developed for men and nonpregnant women may not be generalizable to pregnant women.
32349115,The proposed doses of chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for treatment of COVID-19 (1000 mg/day for 10 days, CQ; 800 mg first day then 400 mg/day for 5 days, HCQ) in many guidelines worldwide, are considerably higher than the maximum recommended daily safe doses of both agents (≤2.3 mg/kg/day, CQ; ≤5.0 mg/kg/day, HCQ) for development of retinal toxicity.
32349133,The novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is clinically characterized by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is responsible for a high number of patients needing mechanical ventilation or intensive care units treatment and for the elevated mortality risk.
32349133,Furthermore, we discussed the biologic plausibility of the thrombotic risk in SARS-CoV-2 and the potential use of an antithrombotic treatment.
32349517,So far, there is no specific anti-coronavirus therapy approved for the treatment of COVID-19.
32349517,For a better popularization of TCM, governments have made several advances in regulations and policies for treatment and measures of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP).
32349517,Therefore, on the basis of epidemiology and virology information, we reviewed relevant meta-analysis and clinical studies of anti-coronavirus therapeutics by TCM, in the aspect of mortality, symptom improvement, duration and dosage of corticosteroid, incidence of complications and the like.
32349902,In these unprecedented times, OMFS surgeons are faced with dilemmas over the priority of treatment, safety of staff, safety of patients and the most appropriate use of available resources.
32349982,Due to the frequent presence of interstitial lung disease and widespread use of immunosuppressive treatment, systemic sclerosis (SSc) patients may be considered at risk for a more severe disease course and higher mortality when they develop Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Coronavirus - 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus infection.
32350134,The patients diagnosed as severe or critical COVID-19 in The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China (Anhui Provincial Hospital) and Anhui Fuyang Second People's Hospital were given tocilizumab in addition to routine therapy between 5 and 14 February 2020.
32350134,Within 5 d after tocilizumab, 15 of the 20 patients (75.0%) had lowered their oxygen intake, and 1 patient needed no oxygen therapy.
32350134,The percentage of lymphocytes in peripheral blood, which decreased in 85.0% of patients (17/20) before treatment (mean, 15.52 ± 8.89%), returned to normal in 52.6% of patients (10/19) on the fifth day after treatment.
32350134,Preliminary data show that tocilizumab, which improved the clinical outcome immediately in severe and critical COVID-19 patients, is an effective treatment to reduce mortality.
32350543,Due to their limited technical features, home respirators are not suitable for the treatment of severely affected patients but can be used for weaning after respiratory improvement, which means that intensive care respirators are available again more quickly.
32350584,The collected data included patients' demographics (age and gender), injury-related (injury type, fracture location, injury mechanism, places where fracture occurred), and treatment modality.
32350686,According to the WHO, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), currently there are no medicines or vaccines that have been claimed to be useful in the prevention or treatment of COVID-19.
32350686,According to the CDC and Chinese treatment guidelines for COVID-19, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and one of the investigational agents (remdesivir) are recommended in critically ill older patients.
32350686,The use of other potential drugs reported in different studies may be considered if treatment with first-line drugs is ineffective.
32350686,There are currently no complete data available from large randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to provide clinical guidance on the use, dosing, or duration to validate the effective role, safety profile, and adverse effects of all of the trial drugs for prophylaxis or treatment of COVID-19.
32350773,Some reported challenges in accessing HIV testing, prevention and treatment services.
32350794,In this emergency situation, several expectations have been raised by the scientific community about the role that artificial intelligence can have in improving the diagnosis and treatment of coronavirus infection, and SIRM wishes to deliver clear statements to the radiological community, on the usefulness of artificial intelligence as a radiological decision support system in COVID-19 positive patients.
32350796,The current global outbreak of COVID-19 represents a major challenge in terms of epidemiology, contagiousness, treatment, as well as clinical and radiological behavior of this disease.
32350818,In the battle against the SARS-CoV‑2 pandemic, chloroquine has emerged as a new potential therapeutic option for the treatment of infected patients.
32350818,A baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) and ECGs recorded during chloroquine treatment were retrospectively collected in patients suspected of having COVID-19.
32350818,A total of 95 patients had a baseline ECG recording and at least one ECG recording during chloroquine therapy.
32350818,Chloroquine treatment resulted in a mean QTc prolongation of 35 ms (95% CI 28-43 ms) using computerised interpretation and 34 ms (95% CI 25-43 ms) using manual interpretation.
32350818,No torsade de pointes was observed during chloroquine treatment.
32350818,After manual review, 22 patients (23%) had a QTc interval exceeding 500 ms during chloroquine treatment.
32350818,None of these patients had a prolonged QTc interval prior to the initiation of chloroquine treatment.
32350857,No major stakeholder seems to have considered how a pandemic deprives patients with a surgical condition of resources, with patients disproportionally affected owing to the nature of treatment (use of anaesthesia, operating rooms, protective equipment, physical invasion and need for perioperative care).
32350861,COVID-19 may also be such a defining moment for clinical pharmacology in terms of its role in drug development and therapy.
32350928,In addition, the known and potent immunomodulatory effects of these agents which support their use in the treatment of auto-immune conditions, and provided a component in the original rationale for their use in patients with COVID-19, may, in fact, undermine their utility in the context of the treatment of this respiratory viral infection.
32350928,Given these facts and the growing uncertainty about these agents for the treatment of COVID-19, it is clear that at the very least thoughtful planning and data collection from randomized clinical trials are needed to understand what if any role these agents may have in this disease.
32350928,In this article, we review the datasets that support or detract from the use of these agents for the treatment of COVID-19 and render a data informed opinion that they should only be used with caution and in the context of carefully thought out clinical trials, or on a case-by-case basis after rigorous consideration of the risks and benefits of this therapeutic approach.
32351121,This raises the question whether the use of RAS inhibitors, the backbone of treatment of cardiovascular, neurovascular, and kidney diseases could increase the susceptibility for coronavirus infection or unfortunate outcomes of COVID-19.
32351196,COVID-19 patients have characteristic reproducible laboratory findings and present a major challenge due to their illness severity and required treatment length. none. not relevant.
32351851,Hydroxychloroquine therapy was started, and the patient responded favorably with improvement of symptoms.
32351873,To systematically review and evaluate the pattern of COVID-19 and the treatment plans.
32351873,The current research taking place to overcome this complex disease and the urgent need to develop improved therapeutics are also discussed.
32351873,Herein, we present an epidemiological overview of the currently available information on the treatment claimed to have helped to bring the situation under control.
32352309,<b>OBJECTIVE.</b> Because CT plays an important role in diagnosis, isolation, treatment, and effective evaluation of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), infection prevention and control management of CT examination rooms is important. <b>CONCLUSION.</b> We describe modifications to the CT examination process, strict disinfection of examination rooms, arrangement of waiting areas, and efforts to increase radiographers' awareness of personal protection made at our institution during the COVID-19 outbreak.
32352401,Presenting signs and symptoms, laboratory and imaging findings, treatment, and complications were recorded from electronic medical records (EMRs).
32352633,Due to extended transportation delays to a cathlab, he received intravenous fibrinolytic therapy, which failed.
32352633,Reperfusion was achieved with rescue coronary angioplasty, but the patient experienced two episodes of acute stent thrombosis at 2- and 36-hr following admission and despite optimal medical therapy.
32352637,Increased vigilance and aggressive treatment of patients with obesity and COVID-19 are warranted.
32352944,Interferon-alpha (5 million U twice daily by inhalation), lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily orally), as well as chloroquine (500 mg twice daily orally for 10 days) and azithromycin (500 mg twice per day) cause a milder course of the disease and reduce the duration of treatment.
32353441,Chest drain represent the first line treatment.
32353547,Nigeria's current national health systems cannot effectively respond to the growing needs of already infected patients requiring admission into intensive care units for acute respiratory diseases and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS COV-2) pneumonia.
32353597,To our knowledge, this is the first reported investigation of a possible role of interleukin-17 target therapy in patients with lung cancer and concomitant severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 infection.
32353740,We are suggesting here a strategy for the COVID-19 treatment that could be effective in curing the patients in the current scenario when no efficient medicine or Vaccine is currently available, and Clinicians solely depend upon the performing trials with drugs with known antiviral activities.
32353825,Burns are an acute-care condition, and burn treatment needs to be initiated before COVID-19 infection status can be excluded.
32353825,The key step to infection prevention is to identify risk points of infection exposure, strengthen the protection against those risk points, and formulate an appropriate diagnosis and treatment protocol.
32353825,Following an in-depth study of the latest literature on COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment, we reviewed the protocols surrounding hospitalization of patients with extensive burns (area≥50 %) in our hospital from February 2009 to February 2019 and, in accordance with the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19, developed an algorithm for protection during diagnosis and treatment of burns.
32353825,Therefore, the aspects of medical protection and the diagnosis and treatment of burns appear to be particularly important during the prevention and control of the COVID-19.
32353825,This algorithm was followed for 4 patients who received emergency treatment in February 2020 and were hospitalized.
32353825,During the COVID-19 epidemic, the early stages of emergency treatment for patients with extensive burns requiring the establishment of venous access for rehydration, endotracheal intubation or tracheostomy, wound treatment, and surgery are the risk points for exposure to infection.
32353825,The implementation of effective, appropriate-grade protection and formulation of practical treatment protocols can increase protection of healthcare worke and reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection exposure.
32353870,Furthermore, treatment options for COVID-19 infection are currently limited.
32354030,Taking into consideration the mortality rate of COVID-19, about 5-7%, and the percentage of positive patients admitted to intensive care units being 9-11%, it should be mandatory to consider and take all necessary measures to contain the COVID-19 infection.
32354030,Moreover, given the recent evidence in different hospitals suggesting IL-6 and TNF-α inhibitor drugs as a possible therapy for COVID-19, we aimed to highlight that a dietary intervention could be useful to prevent the infection and/or to ameliorate the outcomes during therapy.
32354181,More research on prevention and treatment is needed according to an analysis of term density.
32354369,The patient received combination of interferonalfa-1b and ribavirin, lopinavir and ritonavir for antiviral treatment at different stages.
32354369,Other medication was also given to him in combination for anti-inflammation, intestinal microbial regulation, phlegm elimination, liver protection and pulmonary fibrosis prevention purposes.
32354369,We provided oxygen supply to him using BIPAP ventilator and high-flow humidification oxygen therapy instrument to facilitate respiration.
32354369,This case report described an effective supportive medication scheme to treat SARS-COV-2 infected patient and emphasized the necessity of detection of the viral genome using BALF samples and its significance in the diagnosis and prognosis of the disease.
32354491,The hospital network of our public health system has provided most of the resources for the treatment of patients affected by the infection.
32354634,At admission, all had immunosuppression withdrawn and were started on methylprednisolone 16 mg/day, all but one was commenced on antiviral therapy and hydroxychloroquine with doses adjusted for kidney function.
32354634,During a median follow-up of seven days, 87% experienced a radiological progression and among those 73% required escalation of oxygen therapy.
32354637,Overall, two were managed on an out-patient basis, but the remaining five required hospital admission, four in intensive care units.
32354637,Most patients had their immunosuppression reduced and were treated with supportive therapy.
32354734,Palliative care is an important component of the medical response to pandemics and other health emergencies.
32354734,The principles of palliative care do not change, but the practice of palliative care has to change as a result of factors such as greater demand and infection control measures.
32354734,This article makes suggestions for palliative care provision during a pandemic (in developed countries), based on a limited review of the literature and personal experience of the ongoing pandemic (COVID-19 infection).
32354798,We prospectively assessed the medical records, laboratory results, chest CT images and use of medication in a cohort of patients presenting to two designated covid-19 treatment centres in Sichuan, China.
32354798,Outcomes of interest included death, admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), need for mechanical ventilation, treatment with vasoactive agents and classification of disease severity.
32354798,Patients with acute myocardial injury were older, with a higher prevalence of pre-existing cardiovascular disease and more likely to require ICU admission (62.5% vs 24.7%, p=0.003), mechanical ventilation (43.5% vs 4.7%, p&lt;0.001) and treatment with vasoactive agents (31.2% vs 0%, p&lt;0.001).
32354800,Specific cardiovascular considerations are also necessary in supportive treatment with anticoagulation, the continued use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors, arrhythmia monitoring, immunosuppression or modulation, and mechanical circulatory support.
32354990,Patients with IBD are at increased risk of infection, especially when they have active disease and are taking immunosuppressive therapy.
32354990,Data regarding age, sex, IBD (type, treatments and clinical activity), other comorbidities (Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI)), signs and symptoms of COVID-19 and therapies were compared with COVID-19 outcomes (pneumonia, hospitalisation, respiratory therapy and death).
32354990,Thirty-six patients had COVID-19-related pneumonia (46%), 22 (28%) were hospitalised, 7 (9%) required non-mechanical ventilation, 9 (11%) required continuous positive airway pressure therapy, 2 (3%) had endotracheal intubation and 6 (8%) died.
32355107,It is important to balance the need for access to healthcare services, including testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections (STIs).
32355450,These data were compared to the results of the tests conducted pre- and post-treatment.
32355450,However, treatment group students who spent more time using mobile devices to learn the language did not display better performance compared to those who spent minimal time.
32355509,Indeed, while the currently recommended treatment for uncomplicated acute appendicitis is surgical appendectomy, the non-surgical alternative of medical management by antibiotic therapy alone has been widely evaluated by high-quality studies in the literature.
32355509,Insofar as the main limitation of exclusively medical treatment of uncomplicated acute appendicitis is the risk of recurrent appendicitis, this treatment option represents an alternative of choice to reduce the intra-hospital overload in this context of health crisis.The aim of this work is therefore to provide physicians and surgeons with a practical guide based on a review of the literature on the medical treatment of uncomplicated acute appendicitis in adults, to offer this alternative treatment to the right patients and under good conditions, especially when access to the operating room is limited or impossible.
32355564,Dornase alfa should be considered for clinical trials in treatment of severe COVID-19.
32355607,They are concerned about their risk of developing COVID-19 as many are immune suppressed from their disease and/or treatment, whether they should stop their advanced therapies, if they will have a worse outcome if/when infected due to their underlying medication condition(s) and if they will have drug availability, especially with press (without much data) coverage suggesting hydroxychloroquine may be used in COVID-19 infection causing diversion of medication supply.
32355607,The long term effects of the pandemic in patients with rheumatic diseases will not be known until much later and likely include stressors flaring disease (fear, illness, job loss, social isolation), post-traumatic stress, flaring due to stopping medications, less physician visits with subsequent under-treatment, and increases in chronic concomitant fatigue, pain, fibromyalgia.
32355837,Unfortunately, like the previous Coronavirus outbreaks, there is no definite antiviral therapy for the treatment of confirmed cases and hence preventing ourselves from contracting 2019-nCoV is the best way to prevent it from becoming pandemic.
32355837,Herein, we aim to discuss the latest updates on the origin, genomic characteristics, diagnosis, treatment options and current efforts being made by international health organizations with regards to the 2019-nCoV outbreak.
32356252,These two medications may precipitate ventricular dysrhythmias, necessitating cardiac and electrolyte monitoring, and in severe cases, treatment with epinephrine and high-doses of diazepam.
32356252,Recombinant protein therapeutics may cause serum sickness or immune complex deposition.
32356252,Here, we review the use, mechanism of action, and toxicity of proposed COVID-19 therapeutics.
32356301,Past outbreaks of infectious diseases (Ebola and Zika virus) have shown that maladaptive behavior, related to increased psychological stress and anxiety, can interfere with the implementation of treatment strategies and actions and can contribute to a further spread.
32356626,Using an observational database from 169 hospitals in Asia, Europe, and North America, we evaluated the relationship of cardiovascular disease and drug therapy with in-hospital death among hospitalized patients with Covid-19 who were admitted between December 20, 2019, and March 15, 2020, and were recorded in the Surgical Outcomes Collaborative registry as having either died in the hospital or survived to discharge as of March 28, 2020.
32356628,We assessed the relation between previous treatment with ACE inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, beta-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, or thiazide diuretics and the likelihood of a positive or negative result on Covid-19 testing as well as the likelihood of severe illness (defined as intensive care, mechanical ventilation, or death) among patients who tested positive.
32356628,Using Bayesian methods, we compared outcomes in patients who had been treated with these medications and in untreated patients, overall and in those with hypertension, after propensity-score matching for receipt of each medication class.
32356628,There was no association between any single medication class and an increased likelihood of a positive test.
32356760,Lung infection or pneumonia is the common complication of COVID-19, and imaging techniques, especially computed tomography (CT), have played an important role in diagnosis and treatment assessment of the disease.
32356760,CT, positron emission tomography - CT (PET/CT), lung ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been used for detection, treatment, and follow-up.
32356863,Administration of hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-associated pneumonia carries increased risk of corrected QT (QTc) prolongation and cardiac arrhythmias.
32356863,In this cohort study, patients who received hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of pneumonia associated with COVID-19 were at high risk of QTc prolongation, and concurrent treatment with azithromycin was associated with greater changes in QTc.
32356863,Clinicians should carefully weigh risks and benefits if considering hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, with close monitoring of QTc and concomitant medication usage.
32356908,Based on our analysis, delaying the onset of adaptive immune responses during the early phase of infections may be a potential treatment option for high-risk COVID-19 patients.
32356910,This review was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of CPT therapy in COVID-19 patients based on the publications reported till date.
32356910,The main findings from available data are as follows: (a) Convalescent plasma may reduce mortality in critically ill patients, (b) Increase in neutralizing antibody titers and disappearance of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was observed in almost all the patients after CPT therapy, and (c) Beneficial effect on clinical symptoms after administration of convalescent plasma.
32356910,Based on the limited scientific data, CPT therapy in COVID-19 patients appears safe, clinically effective, and reduces mortality.
32356955,In the setting of anticipated resource scarcity in the future, we are forced to reconsider fibrinolytic therapy in our management algorithms.
32357072,Epidemiologic, demographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment, and outcome data were analyzed. <i> <b>Results:</b> </i> The average age of the 28 patients was 68.6 ± 9.0 years.
32357074,Although extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and other modalities of mechanical cardiopulmonary support are increasingly being utilized in the treatment of respiratory and circulatory failure refractory to conventional management, their role and efficacy as support modalities in the present pandemic are unclear.
32357074,We review the rapidly changing epidemiology, pathophysiology, emerging therapy, and clinical outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019; and based on these data and previous experience with artificial cardiopulmonary support strategies, particularly in the setting of infectious diseases, provide consensus recommendations from American Society for Artificial Internal Organs.
32357281,Being semi-emergent in nature, treatment for these patients is currently on hold or delayed in most centers across the country.
32357288,These groups include infertility patients (eg, azoospermic and cryptozoospermic) undergoing medical or surgical treatment to improve sperm quantity and quality, as well as males of reproductive age affected by inflammatory and systemic auto-immune diseases who are about to start treatment with gonadotoxic drugs or who are under remission.
32357380,A questionnaire was distributed to head and neck surgeons assessing opinions related to treatment and concerns for the safety of patients, self, family, and staff.
32357380,Surgeons continued to recommend primary surgical treatment for oral cavity cancers.
32357380,Respondents were more likely to consider non-surgical therapy for patients with early glottic cancers and HPV-mediated oropharynx cancer.
32357503,Due to the scientific community's efforts, there is an increasing body of published studies describing the virus' biology, its transmission and diagnosis, its clinical features, its radiological findings, and the development of candidate therapeutics and vaccines.
32357503,Only by working with a complete set of histological samples obtained through autopsy can one ascertain the exact cause(s) of death, optimize clinical management, and assist clinicians in pointing out a timely and effective treatment to reduce mortality.
32357503,Death can teach us not only about the disease, it might also help with its prevention and, above all, treatment.
32357553,Current treatment plans are still under investigation due to a lack of understanding of COVID-19.
32357553,Hence, repurposing these drugs with a proper formulation is needed to improve the safety and efficacy for COVID-19 treatment.
32357575,There is an urgent need to share expertise and clinical management skills with geriatricians as well as the need for early diagnosis to start treatment at the earliest convenience in the community, with the aim to avoid the collapse of intensive care units.
32357975,Given this sense of randomness, and in the absence of a definitive treatment, medical professionals can feel helpless.
32357994,Cancer patients are presumed to be at increased risk from COVID-19 infection fatality due to underlying malignancy, treatment-related immunosuppression, or increased comorbidities.
32358230,Specific recommendations were made for surgical treatment of cancer, trauma and semi-urgent reconstructive procedures based on available data and literature.
32358232,Although extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and other modalities of mechanical cardiopulmonary support are increasingly being utilized in the treatment of respiratory and circulatory failure refractory to conventional management, their role and efficacy as support modalities in the present pandemic are unclear.
32358232,We review the rapidly changing epidemiology, pathophysiology, emerging therapy, and clinical outcomes of COVID-19; and based on these data and previous experience with artificial cardiopulmonary support strategies, particularly in the setting of infectious diseases, provide consensus recommendations from ASAIO.
32358234,The threat of COVID-19 is particularly serious as there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral therapy.
32358406,The patients continued to be given oxygen by mask and received antitussive, phlegm-dispelling treatment.
32358568,Patients with malignant diseases are assumed to be at increased risk for a worse outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and therefore, guidance regarding prevention and management of the infection as well as safe administration of cancer-therapy is required.
32358689,Although chest X-ray (CXR) is considered not sensitive for the detection of pulmonary involvement in the early stage of the disease, we believe that, in the current emergency setting, CXR can be a useful diagnostic tool for monitoring the rapid progression of lung abnormalities in infected patients, particularly in intensive care units.
32358691,Our results may help to identify the highest-risk patients and those who require specific treatment strategies.
32358791,Whilst the authors reported an infection that occurred during therapy with an IL-23 inhibitor, we would like to briefly report one that occurred during therapy with an IL-17 inhibitor.
32358833,In this review, we identify opportunities for drug discovery in the treatment of COVID-19 and in so doing, provide a rational roadmap whereby pharmacology and pharmacologists can mitigate against the global pandemic.
32358880,There are three proposed major strategies to address care for patients with cancer in this SARS-CoV-2 pandemic with postponing treatment for those with stable cancer, increasing personal protection provisions for patients with cancer, and increasing monitoring if a patient becomes infected with SARS-CoV-2.
32358890,A variety of repurposed drugs and investigational drugs such as remdesivir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, ritonavir, lopinavir, interferon-beta, and other potential drugs have been studied for COVID19 treatment.
32358954,On secondary analysis, 1450/2010 (72%) of patients reported received antimicrobial therapy.
32358956,However, no significant difference in level of IgM and IgG antibody between positive and negative patients of nucleic acid test after treatment was found.
32359035,No agent has yet been proven to be effective for the treatment of patients with severe COVID-19.
32359035,Future controlled trials in patients with severe illness are urgently needed to confirm the definite benefit with IL-6 target therapy.
32359182,we read with great interest the article entitled &quot;Should SARS-CoV-2 influence immunosuppressive therapy for autoimmune blistering diseases?
32359182,This is the first report of COronaVIrus DIsease 2019 (COVID-19) in a patient affected by autoimmune blistering disease (ABD) during immunosuppressive treatment (i.e. azathioprine).
32359182,The authors conclude that it is crucial to learn of more cases of ABD patients under immunosuppressive treatment who have developed COVID-19, in order to better quantify the risk of infection under immunosuppressive therapy.
32359201,The delayed and strong adaptive immune response (high affinity IgM and IgG antibodies) that follows, causes severe inflammation and triggers mediator cascades (complement, coagulation, and cytokine storm) leading to complications often requiring intensive therapy and being, in some patients, fatal.
32359201,This &quot;quantitative and time-sequence dependent&quot; model has several implications for prevention, diagnosis, and therapy of COVID-19 at all ages.
32359203,With supportive care as the current mainstay of treatment, the fatality rate of COVID-19 is 6.9%.
32359203,There are currently several trials assessing the efficacy of different antivirals as treatment.
32359203,In this study, the literature currently available on CQ and HCQ as treatment of COVID-19 was surveyed using EMBASE, PubMed, Cochrane Library, MedRxiv, and one clinical trial registry.
32359205,Seven patients (58%) were on maintenance treatment with immunomodulators/biologics, of these 4 with combined therapy (33%).
32359771,With the possibility that a considerable proportion of the world's population soon could receive COVID-19 pharmacotherapies with torsadogenic potential for therapy or postexposure prophylaxis, this document serves to help health care professionals mitigate the risk of drug-induced ventricular arrhythmias while minimizing risk of COVID-19 exposure to personnel and conserving the limited supply of personal protective equipment.
32359788,Specifically, it has been used in the treatment of many viral infections with varying degrees of clinical efficacy.
32359846,At the same time, delaying treatment such as radiotherapy in cancer patients can be detrimental.
32359937,The purpose of this study was to highlight the importance of timely brachytherapy treatment for patients with gynecologic, breast, and prostate malignancies, and provide a framework for brachytherapy clinical practice and management in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
32359937,There may be a significant negative impact on oncologic outcomes for patients with gynecologic malignancies who have a delay in the timely completion of therapy.
32359937,Delay of prostate or breast cancer treatment may also impact oncologic outcomes.
32359937,If a treatment delay is expected, endocrine therapy may be an appropriate temporizing measure before delivery of radiation therapy.
32359937,Brachytherapy remains a critical treatment for patients and may shorten treatment time and exposure for some.
32359937,Every effort should be made to ensure timely brachytherapy delivery for patients with gynecologic malignancies, and endocrine therapy may help temporize treatment delays for breast and prostate cancer patients.
32360053,During this time, several patients requiring assessment and treatment of endodontic emergencies were directed to the School and Hospital of Stomatology at Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.
32360053,Of the total patient visits during this period, 50.26% of visits were for endodontic treatment.
32360053,Vital pulp therapy can advantageously reduce treatment time, resulting in a reduced risk of infection for vital pulp cases.
32360133,It is unclear whether a more aggressive clinical course might develop in asymptomatic COVID-19 infected subjects during biological therapy and current evidence does not support treatment suspension.
32360133,However, during pandemic, the start of treatment with immunosuppressive drugs and biologics should be postponed whenever possible and based on an individual risk assessment.
32360133,When clinical conditions and the disease activity do not allow a treatment delay, before starting a biological therapy, screening of IBD patients for COVID-19 active infection by RT-PCR should be advisable, even in absence of clinical suspicion.
32360182,Treatment with IFN-α or IFN-β at a concentration of 50 international units (IU) per milliliter reduces viral titers by 3.4 log or over 4 log, respectively, in Vero cells.
32360182,The EC<sub>50</sub> of IFN-α and IFN-β treatment is 1.35 IU/ml and 0.76 IU/ml, respectively, in Vero cells.
32360182,Overall, our results demonstrate the potential efficacy of human Type I IFN in suppressing SARS-CoV-2 infection, a finding which could inform future treatment options for COVID-19.
32360231,The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is a global public health emergency, and new therapeutics are needed.
32360231,It is hoped that knowledge of the potential drug target and mechanism of action of Arbidol will help in the development of new therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2.
32360238,Palliative care providers play an important role in supporting their patients and family members in these difficult times.
32360420,Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infected pneumonia were first published January 30<sup>th</sup>, 2020; these guidelines recommended for the first time that cytokine monitoring should be applied in severely ill patients to reduce pneumonia related mortality.
32360420,In view of the severe morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 pneumonia, we review the current understanding of treatment of human coronavirus infections from the perspective of a dysregulated cytokine and immune response.
32360432,Antiretroviral therapy and prophylactic low molecular weight heparin treatment were initiated.
32360432,In COVID-19 patients with prosthetic graft, an aggressive antithrombotic treatment could be considered to prevent such an event.
32360439,Timely assessment and hyperacute treatment is the key to minimize mortality and morbidity of patients with acute stroke.
32360479,To analyze the diagnosis and treatment of patients with chronic renal failure complicated with novel coronavirus pneumonia, and to evaluate the effect of blood purification technology on the treatment and prognosis of such patients.
32360479,Two patients received continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) every other day for 4-6 h everytime, in addition to the standard treatment.
32360481,According to the Shiyan experience, early diagnosis with multiple swaps of the Q-PCR test and timely treatment can reduce the death rate.
32360482,Since nowadays no scientific evidence establishes a correlation between NSAIDS and worsening of COVID-19, patients should be advice against any NSAIDs self-medication when COVID-19 like symptoms are present.
32360500,Collecting their data and forming a large sample for analysis is more conducive to the recognition, prevention and treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 in children.
32360578,Patients with locally advanced NSCLC (LA-NSCLC) may require treatment in locations where resources are limited, and the prevalence of infection is high.
32360578,Although guiding data is scarce, we present an expert thoracic oncology multidisciplinary (radiation oncology, medical oncology, surgical oncology) consensus of alternative strategies for the treatment of LA-NSCLC during a pandemic.
32360578,The overarching goals of these approaches are the following: (1) reduce the number of visits to a health care facility, (2) reduce the risk of exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2, (3) attenuate the immunocompromising effects of lung cancer therapies, and (4) provide effective oncologic therapy.
32360578,Nonoperative options include chemotherapy, chemoimmunotherapy, and radiation therapy with sequential schedules that may or may not affect long-term outcomes in an era in which immunotherapy is available.
32360578,Whenever radiation therapy is delivered without concurrent chemotherapy, hypofractionated schedules are appropriate.
32360578,The risk of severe treatment-related morbidity and mortality is increased for patients undergoing treatment for LA-NSCLC during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32360578,Adapting alternative treatment strategies as quickly as possible may save lives and should be implemented through communication with the multidisciplinary cancer team.
32360580,At present, there is no specific antiviral treatment recommended for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32360580,The number of virions of SARS-CoV-2 was observed under transmission electron microscope after treatment with LS.
32360580,These findings indicate that LS could inhibit SARS-CoV-2 virus infection via downregulating the expression of inflammatory cytokines induced virus and regulating the activity of NF-κB/MAPK signaling pathway in vitro, making its promising candidate treatment for controlling COVID-19 disease.
32360583,This meta-analysis aimed at evaluating the efficacy and safety of current option of therapies for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) besides COVID-19, in an attempt to identify promising therapy for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected patients.
32360583,We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), China Science and Technology Journal Database (VIP), and WANFANG DATA for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), prospective cohort, and retrospective cohort studies that evaluated therapies (hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir-based therapy, and ribavirin-based therapy, etc.) for SARS, MERS, and COVID-19.
32360583,Compared with control treatment, anti-coronary virus interventions significantly reduced mortality (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.44-0.96; I<sup>2</sup> = 81.3%), remarkably ameliorate clinical improvement (RR 1.52, 95% CI 1.05-2.19) and radiographical improvement (RR 1.62, 95% CI 1.11-2.36, I<sup>2</sup> = 11.0 %), without manifesting clear effect on virological eradication, incidence of ARDS, intubation, and AEs.
32360585,Although many clinical trials are already underway and the majority of patients have received antiviral therapy based on medication experience with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and preliminary results from some clinical trials, there are no antiviral drugs proven to be effective currently.
32360585,We summarize the current therapeutic medicines used in the clinic, hope to be able to provide some implications for clinical medication.
32360608,Currently, no vaccine or approved medical treatment is available.
32360679,The data from all patients who had tested positive for COVID-19 and had presented with ALI requiring urgent operative treatment were collected in a prospectively maintained database.
32360679,Operative treatment was performed in 17 patients (85%).
32360679,The use of prolonged systemic heparin might improve surgical treatment efficacy, limb salvage, and overall survival.
32360703,COVID-19 requires the collaboration of nearly 200 countries to curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2 while gaining time to explore and improve treatment options especially for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and immunocompromised patients, who appear to be at high-risk to die from cardiopulmonary failure.
32360703,Thus, RAAS inhibitors, which may increase the expression levels of ACE2, are commonly used for the treatment of hypertension and CVD.
32360703,We aim to provide a list of potential treatment options and a better understanding of why CVD is a high risk factor for COVID-19 susceptibility and further discuss the acute as well as long-term cardiac consequences.
32361161,In this paper, we will systematically review the pathogenic features, transmission routes, and infection mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2, as well as any adverse effects on the digestive system, urogenital system, central nervous system, and circulatory system, in order to provide a theoretical and clinical basis for the diagnosis, classification, treatment, and prognosis assessment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32361325,At 213 confirmed cases under treatment and isolation, a range of interventions were enforced including intensive and expansive contact, mass testing, isolation, and sterilization.
32361327,Clinical, laboratory, and treatment data were collected and analyzed from 111 hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Union Hospital.
32361388,The results showed that people without public health emergency treatment experience showed worse performance in mental health, resilience and social support, and tended to suffer from psychological abnormality on interpersonal sensitivity and photic anxiety.
32361701,in the reports presented about COVID-19, patients receiving kidney transplantation have not been specifically studied and based on national flowchart, this population is classified as highrisk group, thus it is necessary to be aware of the step-by-step treatment approach of these patients.
32361701,Suspicious cases included patients with a history of dry cough, chills or sore throat accompanying by shortness of breath with or without fever, patients with upper/lower respiratory symptoms with radiological manifestations as single or double-sided multilobular infiltrations on CT scan or plain chest radiography, any one that has a history of close contact with a definite COVID-19 case within the last 14 days, any one with a history of presence in COVID-19 epidemic regions within the last 14 days and patient with pneumonia that despite of proper treatment has an inappropriate clinical response and clinical condition becomes more severe in an unusual way or unexpectedly.
32361703,He was discharged healthy without development of new pulmonary symptoms despite immunosuppressive treatment.
32361715,For his experiment Galen used the random allocation of treatment, today's prospective randomised clinical trial, implemented in the evaluation of novel therapies, widely used internationally, particularly in cancer research!
32361715,COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 new corona virus, brought to the fore the randomised trial, as well as, the ethical dilemmas that surround the allocation of treatment at random, in the face of a devastating pandemic.
32361715,Is it his/her right to request the active treatment that a fellow patient is receiving in the next bed?
32361715,Although the Declaration of Helsinki allows the option of no treatment or even placebo, where no known treatment is available for a certain condition, such as COVID-19, it also emphasizes that &quot;while the primary purpose of medical research is to generate new knowledge, this goal can never take precedence over the rights and interests of individual research subjects&quot;.
32361715,In this brief instance of medical history, the equipoise, the scientific imperative, all arguments and other justifications for providing treatment at random, were thrown out of the window in favour of the human factor!
32361715,Because-it is presumed-the process of randomising subjects, protects the study from the selective inclusion of patients with favourable characteristics, thus inadvertently allowing or facilitating a falsely favourable result for the drug or treatment under investigation.
32361715,Since the middle of the 20<sup>th</sup> century a generation of physicians have been trained to dismiss, or are incapable of evaluating the validity of a treatment beyond the established etiquette of the randomised study.
32361738,Hypnotics may be an effective ancillary treatment for COVID-19.
32361744,Remdesivir has received significant attention for its potential application in the treatment of COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2.
32361744,Remdesivir has already been tested for Ebola virus disease treatment and found to have activity against SARS and MERS coronaviruses.
32361747,Broad-spectrum antimicrobial use is likely to be widespread among hospitalized patients, both as directed and empiric therapy.
32361747,Prospective studies on COVID-19 superinfections are needed, data from which can inform rational antimicrobial treatment and stewardship strategies, and models for market reform and sustainable drug development.
32361927,Only life-threatening pathologies like periprosthetic fractures and acute septic TJA are currently undergoing surgical treatment.
32362005,Rapid and effective diagnoses are vital for the isolation of infected people and starting treatment immediately to stop the spread of COVID-19 virus.
32362061,Therefore, the current data seem to suggest that treatment with dupilumab should not be stopped during COVID-19 pandemic.
32362134,Aesthetic providers will face new and unique challenges as government stay-at-home orders and related commercial limitations are eased, and the U.S. economy reopens and healthcare systems transition from providing only urgent and other essential treatment to resuming routine care and elective procedures and services.
32362134,In a number of areas, this Guidance Supplement exceeds traditional aesthetic office safety precautions, recognizing reduced tolerance in an elective treatment environment for any risk associated with COVID-19's highly variable presentation and unpredictable course.
32362193,Whether asymptomatic patients are contagious or not and whether they need medication are the arguments among clinical experts.<b>Areas covered</b>: This paper reports a special asymptomatic couple with COVID-19, of which the male patient is an intercity bus driver but has not induced confirmed infection of his 188 passengers.
32362193,Their clinical characteristics and medication were summarized and analyzed.<b>Expert opinion</b>: The two asymptomatic patients far away from Wuhan did not seem to be highly contagious.
32362193,They improved obviously, after treatment with the quadruple therapy, but the effective drug is still unknown.
32362235,Our research group has established that noscapine is a chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of drug resistant cancers; however, noscapine was also being used as anti-malarial, anti-stroke and cough-suppressant.
32362245,Currently, several clinical trials are underway to identify specific drugs for the treatment of this novel virus.
32362296,The diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on positive COVID-19 nucleic acid testing according to the unified triage standards of the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (Trial version 4),4 issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
32362299,Treatment with psychotropic medication may sometimes be jeopardised because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
32362344,Clinical, laboratory, and radiologic results, as well as treatment outcome data, were obtained.
32362344,A total of 70 patients underwent CT imaging repeatedly after treatment.
32362344,High body mass index (OR, 1.285; p = 0.017) and tobacco smoking (OR, 16.13; p = 0.032) were independent risk factors associated with disease exacerbation after treatment.
32362368,Indeed, while the currently recommended treatment for uncomplicated acute appendicitis is surgical appendectomy, the non-surgical alternative of medical management by antibiotic therapy alone has been widely evaluated by high-quality studies in the literature.
32362368,Insofar as the main limitation of exclusively medical treatment of uncomplicated acute appendicitis is the risk of recurrent appendicitis, this treatment option represents an alternative of choice to reduce the intra-hospital overload in this context of health crisis.
32362368,The aim of this work is therefore to provide physicians and surgeons with a practical guide based on a review of the literature on the medical treatment of uncomplicated acute appendicitis in adults, to offer this alternative treatment to the right patients and under good conditions, especially when access to the operating room is limited or impossible.
32362392,All cases were mild and successfully recovered after proper treatment.
32362440,No specific and effective anti-viral treatment has been approved for COVID-19 so far.
32362440,Systemic corticosteroid has been sometimes administered to severe infectious diseases combined with the specific treatment.
32362440,However, as lack of the specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug, systemic steroid treatment has not been recommended for COVID-19.
32362440,Rationale of the treatment is to mitigate the local inflammation with inhaled steroid that stays in the lung and to inhibit proliferation of the virus by antiviral activity.
32362644,Hospitalized adult patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection with any one of the following criteria will be eligible to receive lopinavir/ritonavir for 14 days after obtaining written informed consent: (i) respiratory distress with respiratory rate ≥22/min or SpO<sub>2</sub>of &lt;94 per cent; (ii) lung parenchymal infiltrates on chest X-ray; (iii) hypotension defined as systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg or need for vasopressor/inotropic medication; (iv) new-onset organ dysfunction; and (v) high-risk groups - age &gt;60 yr, diabetes mellitus, renal failure, chronic lung disease and immunocompromised persons.

32376263,Family members of patients admitted to the acute palliative care unit and hospice were screened for a period of two weeks.
32376346,For this reason, the Government of Lombardy decided to centralize the treatment of ACS patients in a limited number of centers, including our university cardiology institute, which in the past 4 weeks became a cardiovascular emergency referral center in a regional hub-and-spoke system.
32376394,Furthermore, we must keep in mind that currently, no specific antiviral treatment is available for SARS-CoV-2.
32376394,While moderate-severe forms need in-hospital surveillance plus antivirals and/or hydroxychloroquine; in severe and life-threating subsets a high intensity anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory therapy could be a therapeutic option.
32376397,Severe patients are hospitalized and the treatment is done, though they have not been established yet.
32376397,Currently, however, no treatment is provided for those who are isolated at home or shelter until they get severe symptoms, which will increase the harms to the patients.
32376402,As no specific therapeutics are yet available to control disease evolution, more in-depth understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms induced by SARS-CoV-2 will help to characterize new targets for the management of COVID-19.
32376531,It is therefore essential to provide timely treatment opinions and prevention methods for common skin problems.
32376532,The control measures to contain the epidemic also produced influences on the transport and treatment process of patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and adjustments in the management of the patients need to be made at this particular time.
32376532,AMI is characterized by an acute onset with potentially fatal consequence, a short optimal treatment window, and frequent complications including respiratory infections and respiratory and circulatory failure, for which active on-site treatment is essential.
32376532,To standardize the management and facilitate the diagnosis and treatment, we formulated the guidelines for the procedures and strategies for the diagnosis and treatment of AMI, which highlight 5 Key Principles, namely Nearby treatment, Safety protection, Priority of thrombolysis, Transport to designated hospitals, and Remote consultation.
32376532,For AMI patients, different treatment strategies are selected based on the screening results of SARS-CoV-2, the time window of STEMI onset, and the vital signs of the patients.
32376532,In the transport and treatment of AMI patients, the physicians should strictly observe the indications for patient transport with appropriate protective measurements of the medical staff.
32376546,The selection of appropriate detection techniques and methods for accurate and rapid identification of pathogens therefore plays a key role in improving the diagnosis and treatment of the patients and containing the outbreak.
32376573,According to the Fifth Edition of the Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines by the National Health Commission, the patients were divided into common type, severe type and critical type.
32376573,MSCT volume scanning not only allows early diagnosis of COVID-19 but also provides evidence for evaluating the severity of COVID-19 to assist in the clinical treatment of the patients.
32376583,We review the experience with the diagnosis and treatment of secondary cerebral infarction in an elderly patient with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32376583,Early anti-infection therapy, immune regulation and appropriate anticoagulation intervention may help improve the prognosis of the patients.

32376588,Under the instructions by the E'zhou Medical Team Front Command, the staff made quick responses to the surging number of patients with COVID-19 and rapidly formulated treatment plans based on the local conditions.
32376592,Twelve patients were still on endotracheal mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit, and one of them received ECMO treatment due to poor oxygenation.
32376592,For patients with severe and critical COVID-19 and indications of tracheal intubation, we recommend early intubation with invasive respiratory support to improve the treatment efficacy and reduce the mortality.
32376627,The coronavirus disease COVID-19, caused by emerging SARS-CoV-2, has posed serious threats to global public health, economic and social stabilities, calling for the prompt development of therapeutics and prophylactics.
32376714,The fundamental role of the spike protein in infectivity suggests that it is an important target for vaccine development, blocking therapy with antibodies and diagnostic antigen-based tests.
32377176,Pancreatic cancer is a very aggressive disease and survival remains dismal even with treatment.
32377176,Although we have general strategies available from experience in Italy, we need more treatment specific strategies to help mitigate risks of complications and toxicities from chemotherapy in order to protect our patients from COVID-19 as much as possible.
32377375,Identification of novel BCR signaling may lead to the development of vaccines and antibodies for the treatment of COVID-19.
32377468,Her RT-PCR test was negative after five days of treatment, suggesting that children can clear the virus faster than adults.
32377468,These findings serve as a practical reference for the clinical diagnosis and medical treatment of children with COVID-19.
32377486,Although the chief focus is on minimizing transmission through prevention, combating infection, and saving lives by ramping up the development of treatment and vaccines, very little attention is on the critical issue of physician burnout, resident burnout, and the psychological well-being of HCW.
32377559,An expert US committee developed the US NIH guidelines for COVID-19 treatment, which was just released and will be regularly updated.
32377596,This study reviews the impact of COVID-19 on a hospital system in New York on aspects of medicine, nursing, radiation therapy, and administration.Materials/Methods: A retrospective review was conducted of the department of radiation oncology in a single health system in New York from 3/1/20 to 4/1/20.
32377596,Collaboration was obtained from physicians, nursing, radiation therapy, and administration to recall their policies and impact on specific duties.
32377596,Numbers were obtained for patients on treatment, treatments breaks, and COVID-19 infections amongst staff and patients.
32377596,Radiation Oncology made aggressive efforts to reduce patients on treatment to protect patients and staff as well reallocate staff and space for more acute clinical needs.
32377638,Moreover, additional clinical data are needed in order to determine whether a supportive therapy can help mitigate the development of severe, potentially fatal complications, and further studies are needed to identify the pathophysiology and the mechanism underlying this novel coronavirus-associated infectious disease.
32377677,We searched PubMed and bioRxiv/medRxiv to identify English language papers describing the testing, treatment and prognosis of COVID-19.
32377677,Screening of over 1100 peer-reviewed and pre-print papers yielded n = 22 on COVID-19 testing, n = 15 on treatment and n = 13 on prognosis.

32378459,Application of nanobiotechnology could represent a new avenue for the treatment or disinfection of viruses.
32378471,Current clinical treatment at hand is inadequate to suppress viral replication and inflammation, and reverse organ failure.
32378471,Intensive research efforts have focused on increasing our understanding of viral biology of SARS-CoV-2, improving antiviral therapy and vaccination strategies.
32378471,We will discuss the benefits and caveats of these animal models and present critical findings that might guide the fundamental studies and urgent treatment of SARS-CoV-2-caused diseases.
32378647,Interleukin 6 (IL-6) inhibitor (tocilizumab) had been suggested for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients based on the concept of &quot;cytokine storm&quot; in COVID-19.
32378647,The efficacy of IL-6 monoclonal antibody-directed therapy remains to be fully evaluated.
32378729,More importantly, a compre-hensive understanding of pathological mechanisms of COVID-19 will increase the efficacy of therapy and decrease mortality.
32378737,Combination therapy should be evaluated in vitro.
32378737,Re-purposing drugs for use in COVID-19 treatment is an ideal strategy but is only feasible when product safety has been established and experiments of re-purposed drugs are conducted at clinically relevant concentrations.
32378801,In this article, we compared SARS-CoV-2 with SARS-CoV and influenza virus, discussed current researching progress of COVID-19, including clinical characteristics, pathological changes, treatment measures, and so on.
32378805,There have already been examples of self-medication and overdose.
32378844,A total of nine patients (21 %) had a critical course of illness with treatment in the Intensive Care Department and/or death during their stay in hospital.
32378854,Together, these findings may inform future research, diagnosis, prevention and treatment of COVID-19.
32379056,We prefer a simple and convenient treatment regimen, which may also be postponed appropriately.
32379056,In total, adequate doctor-patient communication is also recommended throughout the treatment.
32379057,During this period, our infection and orthopedic treatment unit in the center of the epidemic area effectively treated 82 elderly patients with hip fracture, and no cross-infection occurred.
32379057,Therefore, our experience in prevention and treatment is worth recommending to frontline anti-epidemic personnel.
32379114,Analyses of early prognosis were based on clinical outcomes and trends in laboratory results during treatment.
32379114,Surgical treatment should be carried out cautiously or nonoperative care should be chosen for patients with fracture in COVID-19-affected areas, especially older individuals with intertrochanteric fractures.
32379199,However, our understanding of the clinical characteristics and treatment of critically ill pediatric patients and their ability of transmitting the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 still remains inadequate because only a handful pediatric cases of COVID-19 have been reported.
32379199,Epidemiology, clinical characteristics, treatment, laboratory data and follow-up information and the treatment of critically ill infant were recorded.
32379346,In the present comment the treatment of COVID19 patients with ACE2 activators, such as diminazene aceturate (DIZE), which are currently used as antiparasitic drugs, is proposed.
32379639,This review aimed to summarize and analyze the pattern identification (PI), herbal formulae, and composition of herbs provided by recent guidelines for the treatment of pediatric COVID-19.

32379667,Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019(COVID-19) will experience high levels of anxiety and low sleep quality due to isolation treatment.
32379667,During this period, the control group received only routine care and treatment.
32379692,No effective treatment for this disease was verified, so the morbidity and mortality rate were supposed higher than flu.
32380026,Instead of redeploying pediatric providers to work with internist-led teams throughout a medical center, pediatric physicians and nurses organized and staffed a 40-bed adult COVID-19 treatment unit within a children's hospital.
32380051,The outbreak of emerging infectious pneumonia caused by 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has posed an enormous threat to public health, and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) have made vast contribution to the prevention, treatment and rehabilitation of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) among Chinese population.
32380051,Given this, based on the Guideline on Diagnosis and Treatment of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China, the present review summarized the basic information, clinical evidence and published literatures of recommended CPMs against COVID-19.
32380051,The details were thoroughly introduced involving compositions, therapeutic effects, clinical indications, medication history of CPMs and the profiles of corresponding research.
32380200,The antiviral peptides can prevent SARS-CoV-2 membrane fusion and can potentially be used for the prevention and treatment of infections.
32380210,For the N gene and ORF1ab gene, the CT values of 4 inactivated and Non-inactivated treatment were correlated (P＜0.001).
32380210,The results of the four treatment methods and specimens without inactivated treatment have shown good consistency.
32380210,The treatment of nasopharyngeal swab specimens using mentioned four inactivated methods had no significant effect on the subsequent detection of the new COVID-19 nucleic acid test.
32380315,A comparison was conducted between subjects tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and those found negative in terms of rate of administration of hydroxychloroquine/colchicine therapy.
32380453,There has so far been no evidence from randomized controlled trials to prescribe any particular anti-nCoV treatment or vaccine, and COVID-19 management has been widely supportive.
32380474,• The main complication of desmopressin treatment in DI is dilutional hyponatraemia.
32380475,• Clinical evaluation should guide those needing investigation • Strict adherence to COVID-19 protection measures is necessary • Alternative ways of consultations (telephone, video) should be used • Early discussion with regional/national experts about investigation and management of potential and existing patients is strongly encouraged • Patients with moderate and severe clinical features need urgent investigation and management • Patients with active Cushing's syndrome, especially when severe, are immunocompromised and social shielding is recommended • In patients with mild features or in whom a diagnosis is less likely, clinical re-evaluation should be repeated at three and six months or deferred until the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 has significantly decreased • Diagnostic pathways may need to be very different from usual recommendations in order to reduce investigations • When extensive differential diagnostic testing is not feasible, it should be deferred, and medical treatment should be initiated • Transsphenoidal pituitary surgery may be avoided during high SARS-CoV-2 viral prevalence • Medical management rather than surgery will be the used for most patients since the short- to mid-term prognosis depends in most cases on hypercortisolism rather than its cause; it should be initiated promptly to minimize the risk of infection in these immunosuppressed patients.
32380511,The mouse model with SARS-CoV-2 infection will be valuable for evaluating antiviral therapeutics and vaccines as well as understanding the pathogenesis of COVID-19.
32380891,We explore here the impact of this unique crisis on victims of elder mistreatment and people at risk of victimization.

32380908,In total, 17 of 24 (71%) patients recovered, 3 of 24 (13%) patients remained critically ill though stable, and 4 of 24 (16%) patients expired for reasons unrelated to the treatment.
32380908,Overall, after one treatment, patients' clinical status and oxygenation improved with an average pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio (PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub>) increase of 192% (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001).
32381073,The chest computed tomography (CT) revealed scattered ground glass opacities in the right lower lobe close to the pleura and resorption after the treatment.
32381264,We recently reported a high cumulative incidence of thrombotic complications in critically ill patients with COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care units (ICUs) of three Dutch hospitals.
32381264,In the competing risk model, chronic anticoagulation therapy at admission was associated with a lower risk of the composite outcome (Hazard Ratio [HR] 0.29, 95%CI 0.091-0.92).
32381426,The reasons for hospitalization were: surgical treatment of cancer (n=5), complex emergencies (n=5), treatment of complications linked to cancer or its treatment (n=3), gastroplasty (n=1), and stoma closure (n=1).
32382072,Carmofur inhibits viral replication in cells (EC<sub>50</sub> = 24.30 μM) and is a promising lead compound to develop new antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
32382873,Currently, there is still no licensed specific antiviral treatment for the human coronavirus disease and a vaccine will not be ready soon.
32382873,However, based on experience from the use of other antiviral agents to treat similar virusses, some treatment options have been tried with some efficacy.
32382932,For the treatment of emergency patients aside from routine epidemic prevention measures, some special measures for oral treatment need to be added.
32382932,From January 23, 2020, to March 2, 2020, a total of 3035 patients received oral therapy during the COVID-19 epidemic in our hospital.
32382932,To our knowledge, no oral health worker or patient has been infected with COVID-19 due to oral treatment, and no patients have complained about the suspension of treatment by complaints hotline.

32383284,The patient was subsequently discharged on medical therapy but returned 3 days later due to worsening chest pain.
32383430,Currently, there is no available treatment proven to be effective against COVID-19, but multiple medications, including hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), are used off label.
32383430,We report the case of a 60-year-old woman without any cardiac history who developed right bundle brunch block and critically prolonged corrected electrocardiographic QT interval (QTc 631 ms) after treatment for 3 days with HCQ, which resolved on discontinuation of the medication.
32383530,However, many clinicians feel ill equipped to deliver therapy via telehealth, while adhering to evidence-based interventions.
32383530,Seventy clinical colleagues of the authors were emailed and invited to share their concerns online about how to deliver cognitive-behavioral therapy for eating disorders (CBT-ED) via telehealth, and how to adapt clinical practice to deal with the problems that they and others had encountered.
32383624,The hypothesis has been proposed that patients COVID-19 positive, under anti-hypertensive treatment with angiotensin enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor-blockers, might have a worse or a better clinical prognosis.
32384004,The Novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic is changing how we deliver expert palliative care.
32384004,Isolation of patients, limitation of visitors and interdisciplinary support, and changes in nursing and provider assessment have all had their impact on how we deliver palliative care.
32384045,Using these markers for early identification of patients with severe disease may help healthcare providers prioritize the need to obtain therapy.
32384183,Rapid identification of the haemophilia status, undelayed and regular liaison with the haemophilia team, proper therapy with factor concentrates or alternative treatments appear instrumental to prevent haemophilia-related complications in this setting.
32384227,Although data are scarce at this stage, there is also an unexplained increased prevalence of obesity in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 admitted to the intensive care units (ICU) (2).
32384516,While several companies have already begun vaccine trials and healthcare facilities have been using a wide-range of medications to treat the virus and symptoms, there is not yet an approved medication regimen for COVID-19 infections.
32384798,Systemic ozone therapy (OT) could be potentially useful in the clinical management of several complications secondary to SARS-CoV-2.
32384917,Veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-V ECMO) may serve as life-saving rescue therapy for refractory respiratory failure in the setting of acute respiratory compromise such as that induced by SARS-CoV-2.
32385132,Therefore, patients with nervous system involvement as the presenting symptoms in the early stage of infection may easily be misdiagnosed and their treatment delayed.
32385187,Many of these changes unfolded over days, including removing residents from outpatient services, minimizing the number of residents on inpatient services, deploying residents to medicine services and medical intensive care units, converting continuity clinic patient visits to virtual options, transforming didactics to online platforms only, and maintaining connectedness in an era of social distancing.
32385225,With regard to the management of pregnant COVID-19 patients, in addition to the treatment of the infection itself, which is not that different from generally accepted principles, it is interesting to consider which obstetric procedures should be used to minimize the adverse effects on mother and child.
32385458,To facilitate any move towards the resumption of widespread dental treatment, possibly without mass vaccination or the widespread use of antibody testing, the aerosol issue will need to be addressed and solved.
32385628,Although the generalized advice to quit smoking as a measure to reduce health risk remains valid, the findings, together with the well-established immunomodulatory effects of nicotine, suggest that pharmaceutical nicotine should be considered as a potential treatment option in COVID-19.
32385672,In this comprehensive review, we discuss the impact of COVID-19 on health and the immune system of those affected, reviewing the latest treatment approaches and ongoing clinical trials.
32385712,SPMs also promote anti-viral B cell antibodies and lymphocyte activity, highlighting their potential use in the treatment of COVID-19.
32385829,There is no proven medication for its treatment, so, all of the medications used for treatment are considered to be off-label.
32385859,Psoriasis treatment relies on immunosuppression, and although most experts agree that the benefit-to risk-ratio is in favor of maintaining selective biologic therapies, and small molecules such as apremilast, they recommend dismission if severe COVID-19 symptoms occur.
32385891,In this quick review we have analyzed the mechanisms of action and related infective risk of drugs used for the treatment of immune-mediated and oncologic skin conditions during the daily clinical practice.
32385891,In the case of a COVID19 patient with complication (such as pneumonia, respiratory failure), treatment suspension should always be considered after taking into account the general condition of the patient, the risk-benefit ratio and the pathophysiology of COVID19 infection.
32385891,The COVID19 emergency pandemic does not imply an under-treatment of existing skin conditions, which together with the SARS-Cov2 infection may jeopardize the patient's life.
32385982,Many phenomena and problems in the work of epidemic prevention, control and treatment are worthy of our deep reflection.
32385985,The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is serious and there is no effective treatment to date.

32386027,Significant improvement regarding the pathogenesis, epidemiology, and diagnosis and therapy for the COVID-19 has been achieved to stop the spread of the epidemics.
32386125,The C19-GRA launched an international, secure, de-identified physician registry of patients with rheumatic diseases infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to provide insights into the management and treatment of COVID-19 in this population.
32386431,We have read with great interest the letter of the European Task Force on Atopic Dermatitis (ETFAD) on SARS-CoV-2-infection and atopic dermatitis published in JEADV (March 2020)<sup>1</sup> in which the authors state: &quot;Targeted treatment selectively interfering with type-2 inflammation such as dupilumab is not considered to increase the risk for viral infections and might thus be preferred …in a situation such as COVID-19 pandemic&quot;.<sup>1</sup>.
32386441,The Public Health Agency of Sweden has analysed how many pregnant and postpartum women with SARS-CoV-2 infection have been treated in intensive care units (ICU) in Sweden between the March 19 and April 20, 2020, compared with non-pregnant women of similar age.
32386448,The antimalarials, Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), and the antivirals Lopinavir/Ritonavir have been recently recorded as having anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) effects.<sup>1</sup> In particular, regarding Italy, one of the countries most affected by the pandemic, the Italian Society of Infectious and Tropical disease (Lombardy section) has recommended the use of HCQ for treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32386460,It is a mildly symptomatic condition with an excellent prognosis, usually requiring no therapy.
32386514,No intervention has yet been proven effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
32386514,We will include randomized clinical trials comparing any intervention for the treatment of COVID-19 (e.g., pharmacological interventions, fluid therapy, invasive or noninvasive ventilation, or similar interventions) with any comparator (e.g., an &quot;active&quot; comparator, standard care, placebo, no intervention, or &quot;active placebo&quot;) for participants in all age groups with a diagnosis of COVID-19.
32386514,Secondary outcomes will be admission to intensive care, mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy, quality of life, and non-serious adverse events.
32386514,This review will continuously inform best practice in treatment and clinical research of this highly prevalent disease.
32386567,Hence, surgical candidates face prolonged delays of beneficial treatment.

32387014,Chlorpromazine (CPZ) is a phenothiazine derivative widely used in clinical routine in the treatment of acute and chronic psychoses.
32387014,This first antipsychotic medication has been discovered in 1952 by Jean Delay and Pierre Deniker at Sainte-Anne hospital.
32387014,The main objective is to demonstrate a shorter time to response (TTR) to treatment in the CPZ+standard-of-care (CPZ+SOC) group, compared to the SOC group.
32387014,Response to treatment is defined by a reduction of at least one level of severity on the WHO-Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement (WHO-OSCI).
32387014,CRP and lymphopenia); (D) a greater decrease in parenchymal involvement (chest CT) on the seventh day post-randomization; (E) to define the optimal dosage of CPZ and its tolerance; (F) to evaluate the biological parameters of response to treatment, in particular the involvement of inflammatory cytokines.
32387014,This CPZ repositioning strategy also avoids numerous developmental and experimental steps and can save precious time to rapidly establish an anti-COVID-19 therapy with well-known, limited and easy to manage side effects.
32387014,The broad spectrum of CPZ treatment - including antipsychotic, anxiolytic, antiemetic, antiviral, immunomodulatory effects along with inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis and modulation of blood-brain barrier - is in line with the historical French commercial name for CPZ, i.e.
32387040,Sofosbuvir active metabolite, however, shows an extremely high intracellular stability So, it is hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 infection could also be susceptible to sofosbuvir and we were convinced to design and run a clinical trial to evaluate the effect of sofosbuvir 400 mg (in combination with velpatasvir 100 mg, as add-on treatment, in addition to standard of care) on the COVID-19.
32387041,This case highlights a problematic ethical double standard in multinational clinical research: trials that would be considered unethical in high income countries (e.g., placebo-controlled where there is an existing treatment) are nonetheless justified in low-and-middle-income countries because the existing standards of care are less (i.e., no access to a treatment).
32387058,This is particularly so for peritoneal neoplastic diseases, for which curative treatment mobilizes substantial personnel, operating room and intensive care resources.
32387058,It is desirable to prioritize disease conditions for which cytoreduction surgery with or without associated hyperthermic intraoperative peritoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) is the gold-standard treatment, and for which systemic chemotherapy cannot be a temporary or long-term alternative: pseudomyxoma peritonei, resectable malignant peritoneal mesotheliomas, peritoneal metastases of colorectal origin if they are resectable and unresponsive to systemic chemotherapy after up to 12 courses, first-line ovarian carcinomatosis if resectable or in interval surgery after at most six courses of systemic chemotherapy.
32387061,However, the very nature of acute lymphoblastic leukemias and their treatment in children and adolescents led the Leukemia Committee of the French Society for the fight against cancers and leukemias in children and adolescents (SFCE) to propose more specific recommendations, even if data for this population are still scarce.
32387139,The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has put significant strain on all aspects of health care delivery, including palliative care services.
32387230,Amid the growing burden of the pandemic, there are parallel emergencies that need to be simultaneously tackled: the proliferation of fake medicines, fake news and medication misinformation surrounding COVID-19.
32387230,Primarily, they can be a relevant source of accurate and reliable information to the public or other fellow health professionals thereby reducing the spread of COVID-19 medication misinformation.
32387246,Where the diagnosis remains uncertain, an endomyocardial biopsy may help identify active cardiac infection through viral genome amplification and possibly refine the treatment risks of systemic immunosuppression.
32387247,Many of the drugs being used in the treatment of the ongoing pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are associated with QT prolongation.
32387301,A possible combined treatment algorithm for COVID-19 is here proposed.
32387320,No therapy has yet proven effective in COVID-19.
32387320,Tocilizumab (TCZ) in patients with severe COVID-19 could be an effective treatment.
32387320,Patients with TCZ (n=20) had a higher Charlson comorbidity index (5.3 [±2.4] vs 3.4 [±2.6], P=0.014), presented with more severe forms (higher level of oxygen therapy at 13L/min vs 6L/min, P&lt;0.001), and had poorer biological findings (severe lymphopenia: 676/mm<sup>3</sup> vs 914/mm<sup>3</sup>, P=0.037 and higher CRP level: 158mg/L vs 105mg/L, P=0.017) than patients without TCZ (n=25).
32387332,In this review, we describe some currently applied diagnostic approaches, as well as therapeutics and vaccines, to prevent, treat and control further outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32387409,In France, the combination hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin (AZ) is used in the treatment of COVID-19.
32387456,The parameters used for each COVID-19 positive patient were gender, hospitalization, admission to intensive care unit (ICU), death, tumor diagnosis, prostate cancer diagnosis, and androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT).
32387574,Bereavement care is considered an integral component of quality end-of-life care endorsed by the palliative care movement.
32387574,In this article, drawing on the palliative care and bereavement literature, we offer suggestions about how to incorporate palliative care tools and psychological strategies into bereavement care for families during this pandemic.
32387575,These medicines, essential to palliative care, are regulated under the international drug control conventions overseen by United Nations (UN) specialized agencies and treaty bodies and under national drug control laws.
32387575,This paper describes the issues related to the lack of availability and limited access to ICEMs during the COVID-19 pandemic in both intensive and palliative care patients in countries of all income levels and makes recommendations for improving access.
32387694,While approved specific antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2 are still lacking, a large number of existing drugs are being explored as a possible treatment for COVID-19 infected patients.
32387694,In an attempt to explore the evidence that supports their use in COVID-19 patients, we comprehensively reviewed the previous studies which used CQ or HCQ as an antiviral treatment.
32387694,Given the current uncertainty, it is worth being mindful of the potential risks and strictly rationalise the use of these drugs in COVID-19 patients until further high quality randomized clinical trials are available to clarify their role in the treatment or prevention of COVID-19.
32387778,In the current work, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was concentrated from wastewater in a catchment in Australia and viral RNA copies were enumerated using reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) resulting in two positive detections within a six day period from the same wastewater treatment plant (WWTP).
32388330,Early insulin therapy seems very promising in alleviating lung injury.
32388331,On the contrary, direct β-cell damage, cytokine-induced insulin resistance, hypokalemia and drugs used in the treatment of COVID-19 (like corticosteroids, lopinavir/ritonavir) can contribute to worsening of glucose control in people with diabetes mellitus.
32388333,IoT implementation impacts on reducing healthcare cost and improve treatment outcome of the infected patient.
32388333,IoT is helpful for an infected patient of COVID-19 to identify symptoms and provides better treatment rapidly.
32388451,Development of PML or other serious opportunistic infections during treatment with natalizumab forces to consider whether de-risking strategies are needed in this particular context and how to manage a high-efficacy treatment.
32388451,This case supports the opportunity to avoid discontinuing or delaying the retreatment over 8 weeks in patients recovered from a recent COVID-19.
32388458,They were receiving treatment with either amantadine (n=15) or memantine (n=7) in stable registered doses.
32388486,The evidence shows that violet/blue (400-470 nm) light is antimicrobial against numerous bacteria, and that it accounts for Niels Ryberg Finsen's Nobel-winning treatment of tuberculosis.
32388805,Due to the current lack of effective pharmacological concepts, this situation has caused interest in (re)considering historical reports on the treatment of patients with low-dose radiation therapy for pneumonia.
32388805,Although these historical reports are of low-level evidence per se, hampering recommendations for decision-making in the clinical setting, they indicate effectiveness in the dose range between 0.3 and 1 Gy, similar to more recent dose concepts in the treatment of acute and chronic inflammatory/degenerative benign diseases with, e.g., a single dose per fraction of 0.5 Gy.
32388805,This concise review aims to critically review the evidence for low-dose radiation treatment of COVID-19 pneumopathy and discuss whether it is worth investigating in the present clinical situation.
32388880,The neurological symptoms improved significantly during treatment with immunoglobulins.
32388937,<b>Objective:</b> To evaluate the efficacy and safety of lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) and arbidol in the treatment of COVID-19 in the real world. <b>Methods:</b> The clinical data of 178 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 admitted to Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital were retrospectively analyzed from January 21 to February 9, 2020.
32388937,According to the patient's antiviral treatment regimen, 178 patients were divided into 4 groups including LPV/r group (59 patients), arbidol group (36 patients), combination therapy with LPV/r plus arbidol group (25 patients) and the conventional treatment group without any antiviral drugs (58 patients).
32388937,The main observation end points of the study was the negative conversion time of nucleic acid of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in pharyngeal swab. <b>Results:</b> The baseline of 4 groups before treatment was consistent and comparable.
32388937,The negative conversion time of nucleic acid of the 2019-nCoV in pharyngeal swab was (10.20 ± 3.49), (10.11 ± 4.68), (10.86 ± 4.74), (8.44 ± 3.51) days separately in the LPV/r group, the arbidol group, the combination therapy group, and the conventional treatment group without significant difference (<i>F</i> = 2.556, <i>P</i> = 0.058).
32388937,However, a statistically significant difference was found in the proportion of deterioration changing from mild/moderate to severe/critical type at day 7 (<i>χ(2)</i> = 9.311, <i>P</i> = 0.017) as follows: the combination therapy group (24.0%, 6/25), the arbidol group ( 16.7%, 6/36), LPV/r group (5.4%, 3/56) and conventional treatment group (5.2%, 3/58).
32388937,Moreover, the frequency of adverse reactions in the three groups receiving antiviral drugs was significantly higher than that in the conventional treatment group (<i>χ(2)</i> = 14.875, <i>P</i> = 0.002). <b>Conclusions:</b> No evidences could prove that LPV/r and arbidol could shorten the negative conversion time of novel coronavirus nucleic acid in pharyngeal swab nor improve the symptoms of patients.
32388937,Noteworthy, the adverse reactions of the antiviral drugs should be paid careful attention during the treatment. <b>目的：</b> 评价真实世界中洛匹那韦/利托那韦（LPV/r）及阿比多尔治疗新型冠状病毒肺炎（COVID-19）的疗效和安全性。
32388947,Among the 7 patients, 1 case died of (B) aggravation, and the other patients' condition was effectively controlled after active treatment.
32389025,Because of its higher potency and better safety profile, hydroxychloroquine may be the more reasonable treatment option if treatment is initiated.
32389318,In addition, staff illness and restructuring of services to deal with the crisis will inevitably place treatment capacities under significant strain.
32389492,For the first time, faced with a crisis with an exceptional magnitude due to the COVID-19 pandemic responsible for saturation of emergency services and intensive care units, the urolithiasis committee of the French Urology Association designed the recommendations for care and treatment of stone-forming patients and their treatment during crisis.
32389518,Patients on renal replacement therapy (RRT) have not been unaware of this situation and due to their characteristics they are especially vulnerable.
32389518,A very high percentage (85%) required hospital admission, 8% in intensive care units.
32389538,Surgical tracheostomies have a role in the weaning process of COVID-19 patients treated in intensive care units.
32389618,She was given atomization inhalation therapy with recombinant human interferon alfa-1b for 10 days.
32389631,Pharmacists have long been involved in public health and emergency preparedness and response (EP&amp;R), including through preventive measures such as screening, vaccinations, testing, medical and pharmaceutical countermeasures, as well as ensuring medication safety and access during natural disasters and pandemics.
32389695,The pandemic is exposing, with terrible clarity, the disparities in human society-racism,<sup>6</sup> poverty,<sup>7</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>8</sup> domestic violence,<sup>9</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>10</sup> and child maltreatment and neglect<sup>11</sup>-and tragically will likely amplify the negative impacts that each has on child development and mental health.
32389697,In this paper, we report the results of plasmapheresis treatment in a series of severely ill patients with COVID-19-related autoimmune meningoencephalitis in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).
32389755,In addition to making practice changes to cope with the adverse realities, oncologists should also work together to raise pragmatic suggestions to policy makers and be strong advocates to protect our patients from the detrimental effect of delay or compromised treatment.
32389859,We discuss the implications of COVID-19 infections for FH patients, the importance of continuing lipid-lowering therapy where possible, issues relating to safety monitoring and service delivery.
32389940,With the explosive growth of confirmed cases, emergency medical supplies are facing global shortage, which restricts the treatment of seriously ill patients and protection of medical staff.
32390367,All patients received antibiotic therapy, and most (97/98 patients; 99.0%) received antiviral therapy (lopinavir/ritonavir).
32390367,Hydroxychloroquine was used in 79 patients (80.6%), and glucocorticoid therapy was used in 18 patients (18.4%).
32390971,We will discuss the potential of AAV-based gene therapy technology for <i>in vivo</i> therapeutic antibody delivery to combat SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and the future emergence of severe CoVs.
32391169,During infection and its complication such as sepsis, hypotension could be exacerbated by antihypertensive drugs because homeostasis mechanisms such as sodium balance, renin angiotensin aldosterone system and/or sympathetic nervous system can be mitigated by antihypertensive drug therapy.
32391234,We describe the clinical presentation of this patient, the diagnostic process, the laboratory and imaging investigations, as well as the course of treatment.
32391242,Precision medicine (PM) represents a new paradigm in disease diagnosis, prevention, and treatment.
32391242,Better understanding of pathogenic pathways together with an accurate phenotype classification of patients presented with SARS-CoV-2 infection and symptoms might contribute to a more accurate definition of biomarkers and other diagnostic tools, which may lead to more precise mitigation strategies, personalized pharmacologic options, as well as new biological therapy developments.
32391282,In this historical moment, medical oncologists are required to consider the possibility to delay active treatment administration based on a case-by-case risk/benefit evaluation.
32391282,Potential risks associated with COVID-19 infection should be considered, considering tumor histology and natural course, disease setting, clinical conditions, and disease burden, together with the expected benefit, toxicities (e.g., myelosuppression or interstitial lung disease), and response obtained from the planned or ongoing treatment.
32391282,Proactive management and containment measures, applied in a structured and daily way, has significantly aided the identification of advance patients with suspected symptoms related to COVID-19, limiting their admission to our cancer center; we have thus been more able to protect other patients from possible contamination and at the same time guarantee to the suspected patients the immediate treatment and evaluation in referral hospitals for COVID-19.
32391308,Furthermore, given that a relevant proportion of infected people need hospitalization in Intensive Care Units, this may be a crucial issue for National Healthcare System's capacity.
32391369,The aim was to investigate the effectiveness of glucocorticoid therapy in patients with COVID-19.
32391519,Treatment and neonatal outcomes are also reported.
32391657,Early identification, early isolation, early diagnosis and early treatment are important for clinical management.
32391657,The treatment of mild or moderate type of child COVID-19 is mainly symptomatic.
32391657,For severe and critical ill cases, the oxygen therapy, antiviral drugs, antibacterial drugs, glucocorticoids, mechanical ventilation or even extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) may be adopted, and the treatment plan should be adjusted timely through multi-disciplinary cooperation.
32391658,Based on the present expert consensus carried out by National Health Commission and National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, our team summarized and established an effective treatment strategy centered on &quot;Four-Anti and Two-Balance&quot; for clinical practice.
32391658,Meanwhile, integrated multidisciplinary personalized treatment was recommended to improve therapeutic effect.
32391658,Early antiviral treatment could alleviate disease severity and prevent illness progression, and we found lopinavir/ritonavir combined with abidol showed antiviral effects in COVID-19.
32391658,The artificial liver blood purification system could rapidly remove inflammatory mediators and block cytokine storm.Moreover, it also favored the balance of fluid, electrolyte and acid-base and thus improved treatment efficacy in critical illness.
32391658,Conservative oxygen therapy was preferred and noninvasive ventilation was not recommended.
32391658,We also integrated Chinese medicine in treatment to promote disease rehabilitation through classification methods of traditional Chinese medicine.
32391658,However, since COVID-19 was a newly emerging disease, more work was warranted to improve strategies of prevention, diagnosis and treatment for COVID-19.
32391659,Severe and critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were usually with underlying diseases, which led to the problems of complicated drug use, potential drug-drug interactions and medication errors in special patients.
32391659,Based on <i>Diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia</i> (<i>trial version</i> 6), and <i>Management of COVID</i>-19: <i>the Zhejiang experience</i>, we summarized the experience in the use of antiviral drugs, corticosteroids, vascular active drugs, antibacterial, probiotics, nutrition support schemes in severe and critically ill COVID-19 patients.
32391659,It is also suggested to focus on medication management for evaluation of drug efficacy and duration of treatment, prevention and treatment of adverse drug reactions, identification of potential drug-drug interactions, individualized medication monitoring based on biosafety protection, and medication administration for special patients.
32391661,By using Euler integral algorithm to solve the modified SEIR dynamics model, the epidemic situation in Hubei province was analyzed, and the impact of prevention and control measures such as quarantine and centralized treatment on the epidemic development was discussed.
32391661,Theoretical analysis showed that prevention and control quarantine and medical follow-up quarantine played an important inhibitory effect on the outbreak of the epidemic.The centralized treatment played a key role in the rapid decline in the number of infected people.
32391663,The chest CT images of patients with COVID-19 have certain characteristics with dynamic changes, which are of value for monitoring disease progress and clinical treatment.
32391664,A total of 67 patients diagnosed as COVID-19 by nucleic acid testing were collected and divided into 4 groups according to the clinical stages based on <i>Diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia (trial version 6)</i>.
32391665,During the isolation treatment of suspected COVID-19 patients, early psychological intervention should be carried out for the female patients with known contact history of epidemic area and personnel in epidemic area, and drug treatment should be given in advance if necessary.
32391666,To analyze the roles of multidisciplinary team (MDT) in the diagnosis and treatment of suspected cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32391666,With the guidance of MDT, one COVID-19 patient was transferred to designated provincial hospital after effective treatment; one patient complicated with acute cholecystitis underwent gallbladder puncture and drainage; and COVID-19 was excluded in a highly suspected patient after alveolar lavage fluid examination.
32391666,The efficiency of diagnosis and treatment for suspected COVID-19 patients can be improved with MDT, particularly for complicated cases.
32391667,To evaluate the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in the treatment of patients with moderate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32391667,We prospectively enrolled 30 treatment-naïve patients with confirmed COVID-19 after informed consent at Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center.
32391667,Patients in HCQ group were given HCQ 400 mg per day for 5 days plus conventional treatments, while those in the control group were given conventional treatment only.
32391667,One patient in HCQ group developed to severe during the treatment.
32391667,Larger sample size study are needed to investigate the effects of HCQ in the treatment of COVID-19.
32391668,To investigate the effect of corticosteroids therapy on the inflammatory response in a critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patient.
32391668,Thereafter, the dose was adjusted in a timely manner and the therapy lasted for 13 days.
32391669,To observe the clinical effect of plasma exchange and tocilizumab in treatment of patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32391669,The C-reactive protein (CRP) and IL-6 levels were significantly decreased and the lymphocyte and prothrombin time were improved in 3 patients after treatment with plasma exchange; while inflammation level was not significantly decreased, and lymphocyte and prothrombin time did not improve in 3 patients treated with tocilizumab.
32391670,We applied HFNC for oxygen therapy in severe and critical ill COVID-19 patients and summarized the following experiences.
32391670,Thirdly, to avoid hypoxia or hypoxemia, the treatment goal of HFNC should be maintained the oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) above 95% for patients without chronic pulmonary disease.
32391670,Finally, patients should wear a surgical mask during HFNC treatment to reduce the risk of virus transmission through droplets or aerosols.
32391671,The report shows that COVID-19 in pregnancy women could be cured with active treatment, and the maternal and fetal outcomes can be satisfactory.
32391672,The inflammation indicators and fever of this patient were effectively controlled and the lung lesions remained stable after active anti-viral treatment, then the radical colorectomy was performed after the viral negative conversion for twice.
32391675,To analysis the medication characteristics of the prescriptions issued via open channel by the National and Provincial Health Committee and the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine in treating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32391675,We collected the data of traditional Chinese medicine related to treatment plans published by the National and Provincial Health Committee and the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine from the start of COVID-19 outbreak to February 19, 2020.
32391675,The study collected 4 national and 34 regional prevention and treatment plans, 578 items, 84 traditional Chinese formulations, 60 Chinese patent medicines, and 230 Chinese herbs.
32391675,The main medication characteristics are clearing heat, entilating lung, removing toxicity and removing turbidity.
32391741,Overall, the most common CT findings were ground glass opacity (114/119, 96%) and consolidation (47/119,40%). 29/119 (24%) patients required major interventions (vasopressor medication or intubation) and 27/119 (23%) died.
32391877,Clinical, laboratory, and treatment data were collected and compared between patients who died and survivors.
32391999,Since the outbreak of COVID-19, chloroquine has been mentioned as a possible treatment.
32391999,Recently, the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment published treatment options for antiviral treatment for COVID-19 where chloroquine was suggested as first choice for off-label treatment, beside remdesivir en lopinavir/ritonavir.
32392007,The current guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of primary respiratory infections are still useful during the COVID-19 epidemic.Telephone triage of patients with respiratory complaints aims to identify patients with complications or an increased risk of complications.There are no indications to test for SARS-CoV-2 virus in general practice.During this COVID-19 epidemic, protective clothing is recommended in all physical contacts with patients with respiratory complaints.There is no reason to be cautious about using NSAIDs in patients suspected of COVID-19.
32392007,Amoxicillin is first choice treatment for respiratory infections during the COVID-19 epidemic; there is lack of evidence to support azithromycin as a first choice.Respiratory rate &gt; 24 / min or saturation &lt;92-94% indicate imminent respiratory decompensation and may be reasons for referral.
32392282,Among patients hospitalized in metropolitan New York with COVID-19, treatment with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, or both, compared with neither treatment, was not significantly associated with differences in in-hospital mortality.
32392288,While there is evidence that the burden of COVID-19 infection in hospitalized children is lesser than in their adult counterparts, to date, there are only limited reports describing COVID-19 in pediatric intensive care units (PICUs).
32392333,A breakdown of treatment and prevention services for these conditions may even overshadow the projected morbidity and mortality from COVID-19.
32392473,Diabetes-related factors of glycemic control, medication pharmacodynamics, and insulin access can impact the severity of a COVID-19 infection.
32392559,The biology of each leukemia and its corresponding treatment with conventional intensive chemotherapy, with or without targeted therapies (venetoclax, FLT3 inhibitors, IDH1/2 inhibitors, Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors), introduce additional layers of complexity during COVID-19 high-risk periods.
32392562,However, more studies are needed to clarify the efficacy of these therapeutics.
32392562,In addition to antiviral therapy, potential ACE2- and AT1-R-inhibiting strategies, and other supportive care, we suggest other potential JAKinibs and novel anti-inflammatory combination therapies that affect the JAK-STAT pathway in patients with COVID-19.
32392624,A group was formed, comprising three senior geriatricians, a former dean, a palliative care specialist, and a lawyer/ethicist.
32392624,Recommendations included the approach to older persons both in the community and in long-term care institutions, a triage instrument, and palliative care.
32392624,The guideline emphasized that no matter what, in the spirit of beneficence, anyone who fell ill must receive active palliative care throughout the course of a COVD-19 infection but especially at the end of life.
32392741,Fibrinogen seems to increase early in COVID-19 patients and may be used as a risk stratification marker for the early detection of a subgroup of COVID-19 patient at increased risk to develop SARS, who might benefit from a different and thorough clinical surveillance and treatment.
32392859,This is an important issue to be identified in order to provide more specific therapy earlier, including both antiviral and anti-inflammatory drugs associated with anti anticoagulant therapy.
32393325,Preparing intensive care units (ICU) is an integral part of any pandemic response.
32393381,Perceived causes of infection, infection prevention, control knowledge and behaviour, psychological changes, symptoms and treatment were measured.
32393401,Given its rare side effects and relatively wide safety, prophylactic vitamin D supplementation and/or food fortification might reasonably serve as a very convenient adjuvant therapy for these two worldwide public health problems alike.
32393438,The method is a powerful tool for studying the underlying mechanism of platelet aggregation and is expected to open a window on an entirely new class of clinical diagnostics, pharmacometrics, and therapeutics.
32393438,Blood clots have also been linked to harmful inflammation and the spread of cancer, and there are now preliminary reports of remarkably high rates of clotting in COVID-19 patients in intensive care units.
32393438,This could help them choose whether aspirin or another anti-platelet drug would be the best treatment.
32393447,Temporary closure of outpatient health facilities in some secondary and tertiary care hospitals have deprived millions of NCD patients of their regular medication and diagnostic health needs.
32393448,The WHO and the FDA have not found adequate evidence to recommend any specific medication for the treatment of Covid-19.
32393594,Management of COPD with COVID-19 warrants standard-of-care treatment with antimicrobial agents and corticosteroids, though limiting the dose and duration of steroids use may be warranted due to the risk of increased viral shedding.
32393597,HCQ is the only SLE treatment shown to increase survival and any change in the HCQ regimen is potentially dangerous.
32393597,Providers need to make thoughtful, informed decisions in this time of medication shortage.
32393664,We found that the average patient receiving treatment with hydroxychloroquine for rheumatic diseases, including children and non-pregnant/pregnant adults, are unlikely to achieve total serum or plasma concentrations shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in-vitro.
32393985,Evidence of the benefits of vitamin C (VC) for the treatment of sepsis is accumulating.
32394153,Prevention and risk reduction strategies are paramount in the current absence of effective treatment or a vaccine.
32394237,Rarely, pulmonary embolism may be encountered in patients with severe COVID-19 infection, especially in intensive care units.
32394338,The current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has caused significant mortality over a short time and has necessitated an increase in provision of both critical care and palliative care.
32394344,All patients were on antiretroviral treatment, of them 22 on tenofovir-containing regimen and 4 on the protease inhibitor darunavir.
32394416,On the other hand, patients, who need emergency healthcare, should also be provided with appropriate treatment.
32394416,Healthcare professionals should choose a treatment method appropriately in the circumstances to protect themselves and their patients as much as possible.
32394467,Neuraminidase inhibitors such as oseltamivir, peramivir, and zanamivir are invalid for 2019-nCoV and are not recommended for treatment but protease inhibitors such as lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) inhibit the progression of MERS-CoV disease and can be useful for patients of COVID-19 and, in combination with Arbidol, has a direct antiviral effect on early replication of SARS-CoV.
32394467,Favipiravir increases clinical recovery and reduces respiratory problems and has a stronger antiviral effect than LPV/r. currently, appropriate treatment for patients with COVID-19 is an ACE2 inhibitor and a clinical problem reducing agent such as favipiravir in addition to hydroxychloroquine and corticosteroids.
32394481,On March 16, 2020, the French Society of Pharmacology and Therapeutics put online a national Question and Answer (Q&amp;A) website, https://sfpt-fr.org/covid19 on the proper use of drugs during the COVID-19 pandemic.

32405071,Eligible patients using renin-angiotensin system blockers (ACEI/ARBs) with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 will be randomized to a strategy of continued ACEI/ARB treatment versus temporary discontinuation for 30 days.
32405071,BRACE CORONA will evaluate whether the strategy of continued ACEI/ARB therapy compared with temporary discontinuation of these drugs impacts clinical outcomes among patients with COVID-19.
32405079,Novel coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19) has been spreading worldwide, and tracking laboratory indexes during the diagnosis and treatment of patients with severe COVID-19 can provide a reference for patients in other countries and regions.
32405079,We closely tracked the epidemiological history, diagnosis and treatment process, as well as dynamic changes in routine blood indicators, of a severe COVID-19 patient who was hospitalized for 26 days.
32405079,Dynamic changes in routine blood parameters might be helpful for the prognosis of COVID-19 patients and evaluation of the treatment effect.
32405080,Monitoring T cell changes has important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of severe patients who may become critically ill.
32405088,Guideline directed drug therapy including ACEI/ARB/ARNI is to be continued in patients with pre-existing HF.
32405101,In this prospective study consecutive patients hospitalized in non-intensive care units with diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia and D-dimer &gt; 1000 ng/ml were screened for asymptomatic DVT with complete compression doppler ultrasound (CCUS).
32405115,The COVID-19 pandemic has brought major challenges to healthcare systems and public health policies globally, as it requires novel treatment and prevention strategies to adapt for the impact of the pandemic.
32405115,Moreover, social and economic changes caused by the pandemic, along with the traditional difficulties regarding treatment access and adherence - will certainly worsen during this period, therefore aggravate their condition.
32405115,In that sense, specific strategies for prevention and treatment must be discussed. health care professionals dealing with SUD must be aware of the risks and challenges they will meet during and after the COVID-19 outbreak.
32405117,SARS-CoV-2-caused COVID-19 cases are growing globally, calling for developing effective therapeutics to control the current pandemic.
32405152,Compliance with highest level of personal protection and restriction of treatment to emergency cases is recommended during the outbreak.
32405156,Hydroxychloroquine (CLQ-OH)/azithromycin (ATM) combination therapy is currently being tested for the treatment of COVID-19, with promising results.
32405156,This molecular mechanism may explain the beneficial effects of CLQ-OH/ATM combination therapy in patients with COVID-19.
32405160,Patients admitted before March 13th (n=23) were prescribed the standard therapy (hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir and ritonavir) and were considered controls.
32405164,Yet, the World Health Organization officially announced that there is still at present no recommended anti-nCoV vaccine for subject at-risk, nor treatment for patients with suspected or confirmed nCoV, let alone 2019-nCov.
32405164,It is therefore timely and critical to propose new possible and practical approaches for preventive interventions for subjects at-risk, and for treatment of patients afflicted with 2019-nCov-induced disease (Corona Virus Disease 2019; COVID-19) before the present situation explodes into a worldwide pandemic.
32405226,It has been used for centuries for the treatment of fever and chills, and has been recently approved for the treatment of malaria due to its endoperoxidase properties.
32405226,In this review, we aim to provide a comprehensive update of the current knowledge of the effects of artemisinins in relation to respiratory diseases to identify gaps that need to be filled in the course of repurposing artemisinins for the treatment of respiratory diseases.
32405226,In addition, we postulate whether artemisinins can also be repurposed for the treatment of COVID-19 given its anti-viral and anti-inflammatory properties.
32405229,The evaluation of the treatment of these comorbidities at baseline and during COVID-19 is scarce and the results are conflicting.
32405229,The aim of this review article was to summarize the prevalence of hypertension and CVD in patients with COVID-19, their influence on the outcome and the effect of treatment of hypertension and CVD in COVID-19 patients.
32405236,This is a discussion and comparison of the virus structures, transmission characteristics, clinical symptoms, diagnosis, pathological changes, treatment and prevention of the two kinds of viruses, CoVs and IAVs.
32405418,None of the infected nurses were hospitalized and all of them preferred to be quarantine at home and receive the necessary care and treatment (Oseltamivir, Azithromycin and Kaletra.
32405418,This study also reported that receiving the necessary care and treatment at home was a good experience for nurses that can be used in some cases.
32405421,Repurposing broad-spectrum antivirals is an immediate treatment opportunity for 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
32405421,Favipiravir is an antiviral previously indicated for influenza and Ebola, which has shown some promise in early trials for treatment of COVID-19.
32405421,Favipiravir may be safe and tolerable in short-term use, but more evidence is needed to assess the longer-term effects of treatment.
32405422,There were no teratogenic concerns, but the evidence base was very limited.Based on a weighted-mean cost of US $61/kg, a 14-day course of treatment with nitazoxanide 500 mg BD would cost $1.41.
32405422,We estimate that it would be possible to manufacture nitazoxanide as generic for $1.41 for a 14-day treatment course at 500 mg BD, up to $4.08 at 1100 mg TDS.
32405422,If efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 is demonstrated in clinical studies, nitazoxanide may represent a safe and affordable treatment in the ongoing pandemic.
32405423,Costs of production ranged between $0.30 and $31 per treatment course (10-28 days).
32405423,Estimations for the minimum production costs can strengthen price negotiations and help ensure affordable access to vital treatment for COVID-19 at low prices globally.
32405454,The patient referred to treatment clinic for COVID-19 in Imam Reza hospital of Tabriz (Iran) after having flu-like symptoms.
32405454,Lopinavir/ritonavir (200mg/50mg) two tablet tow times, Ribavirin 200mg every six hours, and Oseltamivir 75mg tow times were given for the treatment of COVID-19.
32405454,The medications used for treatment of pneumonia were Meropenem, Ciprofloxacin, Vancomycin.
32405509,We discuss the current knowledge gaps driven by questions around the quality and consistency of clinical trial results, patient selection, diagnostic methodologies, use of suppressive antibiotic therapy, and methods for adverse event reporting.
32405509,We provide specific recommendations for future trial designs of FMT to provide improved quality of the clinical evidence to better inform treatment guidelines.
32405620,Since the World has been facing the COVID-19 pandemic, special attention has been taken concerning cancer patients; related to their immunosuppression status, adding risk for more aggressive COVID-19 and mortality, but also concerns about the access and the quality of care in cancer therapy.
32405620,In essence, they are immunosuppressed in different intensities during their treatment.
32405620,Most of them are elderly and all of them require long-term therapy, with prolonged contact with the health care system, possibly including a stem cell transplant during the treatment.
32405622,This potential utilization of DPP4 as a binding target for SARS-CoV-2 may offer novel insight into the viral pathogenesis and help the surveillance and therapeutics strategy for meeting the challenge of COVID-19.
32405641,The infection can be life threatening and require intensive care treatment.
32405641,Modified diagnostic and treatment algorithms are proposed to adapt evidence-based protocols for this unprecedented challenge.
32405780,With the continuous spread of the new coronavirus pneumonia epidemic in even the world, prevention and treatment of the disease have become urgent tasks.
32405780,In addition to being controlled through effective isolation, we need a rapid response from the healthcare and biotechnology industries to accelerate drug treatment research.
32405780,By reviewing the currently available literature published at home and abroad, we summarize the current research progress of drug treatment during the epidemic period.
32405780,At present, the drugs that can be used for treatment mainly include antiviral drugs, antimalarials, glucocorticoids, plasma therapy, biological agents, and traditional Chinese medicine.
32405780,The effectiveness and safety of drug therapy need to be confirmed by more clinical studies.
32405783,The management of mild disease is supportive, while very many immunomodulatory and antiviral therapies are being investigated for the treatment of severe disease.
32405877,At present, anti-IL-6, antiviral therapy, convalescent plasma, hydroxychloroquine, and azithromycin among others are being investigated as potential treatments for COVID-19.
32405877,As the disease etiology and precise therapeutic interventions are still not definitively defined, we wanted to review the roles that complement and the contact system may have in either the treatment or pathogenesis of the disease.
32405882,During the current viral outbreak, physicians should not neglect the possibility of other diseases that represent neurological emergencies and require immediate recognition and treatment.
32405955,Older patients with CA and those with immune-mediated ataxias on immunosuppressive medication are potentially at high risk of developing serious complications of the infection, although it is also possible that immunosuppressive agents may provide a defense against cytokine storm.
32405955,As the disruption of social patterns and healthcare delivery in response to the crisis continues, interruption of rehabilitation, speech and language therapy, and face-to-face consultations threatens to have a negative impact on the course and well-being of CA patients.
32405974,Currently, the number of severe cases worldwide has increased rapidly, but the experience in the treatment of infected patients is still limited.
32405974,Given the lack of specific antiviral drugs, multi-organ function support treatment is important for patients with COVID-19.
32405974,This paper provides a clinical reference and a new strategy for the optimal treatment of COVID-19 worldwide.
32406115,And, although not all of the microbially relevant infrastructure will be within reach of schools, there is usually access to a market, local food store, wastewater treatment plant, farm, surface water body, etc., all of which can provide opportunities to explore microbiology in action.
32406317,It is noteworthy that Viomycin showed higher -CDocker energy as compared to the drugs currently under clinical trial for SARS-CoV-2 treatment <i>viz.</i> Ritonavir and Lopinavir.
32406348,Introducing a mindfulness and meditation practice during this pandemic has the potential to complement treatment and is a low cost beneficial method of providing support with anxiety for all.
32406369,It is extremely important to understand this phenomenon, as individuals with intermittent virus shedding could be falsely identified as reinfected and may benefit from ongoing antiviral treatment.
32406381,The timely and accurate diagnosis of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), remains the cornerstone of efforts to provide appropriated treatment for patients, to limit further spread of the virus and ultimately to eliminate the virus from the human society.
32406381,We focus this article on (a) developments for improvement of diagnosis of specific SARS-CoV-2 virus, (b) laboratory changes in the immunologic and coagulation system, (c) therapeutic options for anticoagulant treatment of seriously affected patients and (d) on the perspectives through improvement of diagnostic and therapeutic medical procedures.
32406395,As there is no vaccination and proper medicine for treatment, the recent pandemic caused by COVID-19 has drawn attention to the strategies of quarantine and other governmental measures, like lockdown, media coverage on social isolation, and improvement of public hygiene, etc to control the disease.
32406512,Patients on these medications should not stop their medication prophylactically.
32406687,Currently, the new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic without any well-calibrated treatment.
32406853,An important group who will be confronted with the treatment of COVID19 positive patients are HCP during (semi) acute surgery.
32406873,In December 2019, in the city of Wuhan, in the Hubei province of China, treatment-resistant cases of pneumonia emerged and spread rapidly for reasons unknown.
32406927,Convalescent plasma and hyperimmune immunoglobulin may reduce mortality in patients with respiratory virus diseases, and are currently being investigated in trials as a potential therapy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32406927,OBJECTIVES: To assess whether convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin transfusion is effective and safe in the treatment of people with COVID-19.
32406927,Effectiveness of convalescent plasma for people with COVID-19 The following reported outcomes could all be related to the underlying natural history of the disease or other concomitant treatment, rather than convalescent plasma.
32406927,We do not know whether convalescent plasma therapy affects mortality (very low-certainty evidence).
32406927,Time to discharge from hospital Six studies reported time to discharge from hospital for at least some participants, which ranged from four to 35 days after convalescent plasma therapy.
32406927,We are very uncertain whether or not convalescent plasma therapy affects the risk of moderate to severe adverse events (very low-certainty evidence).
32406927,We are very uncertain whether or not convalescent plasma therapy affects the risk of serious adverse events (very low-certainty evidence).
32406927,We identified very low-certainty evidence on the effectiveness and safety of convalescent plasma therapy for people with COVID-19; all studies were at high risk of bias and reporting quality was low.
32406985,Herein, we report a case of successful treatment of SARS-CoV-2 induced inflammatory syndrome by utilization of the interleukin-6 receptor antagonist (IL-6Ra) tocilizumab.
32407051,However, the efficacy of hyper-immune/convalescent plasma treatment for severe infectious diseases is still controversial.
32407051,The optimal dose and time point, as well as the clinical benefit of hyper- immune/convalescent plasma therapy, needs further investigation in larger well-controlled trials.
32407142,Bad advice can lead to tragedy, such as death from taking an unproven medication.<sup>1</sup> Now, more than ever, public health policies should be based on the best available evidence.
32407178,The challenge of social distancing, providing care for those infected by COVID-19, continuing appropriate treatment of time-sensitive diseases, and the looming threat of health care worker infections required swift planning and restructuring of training programs.
32407289,It is also recommended to increase and expand resources of intensive care units including respirators, increase the capacity and the number of trained health staff in the area of public health and epidemiology, ensure continued provision of essential public health programs and mobilize the resources of non-governmental sector and donors to provide services for refugees and vulnerable populations.
32407459,We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of all published studies up to March 15, 2020 which reported COVID-19 clinical features and/or treatment outcomes. 45 studies reporting 4203 patients were included.
32407459,Treatment with lopinavir-ritonavir showed no significant benefit in mortality and ARDS rates.
32407539,Many small stand-alone trials and observational studies of single-agent interventions are currently running or in planning; many of these will likely not deliver robust results that could support regulatory and patient-level treatment decisions.
32407539,We here discuss actions that all stakeholders in the clinical trial ecosystem need to take to ensure that the window of opportunity during this pandemic will not shut, both for patients in need of treatment and for researchers to conduct decision-relevant clinical trials.
32407543,COVID-19 pandemic is an emerging new human disease, where no vaccines, or monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), or drugs are currently available for therapy.
32407609,The patient with older age and higher comorbidities failed to recover from the viral illness that has no definitive treatment.
32407719,One patient died after withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy because of metastatic cancer.
32407772,Transparent and clear communication is crucial, coupled with dedication to provide the best possible care to patients, including palliative care.
32407884,There is no known effective therapy for patients with COVID-19.
32407884,We reviewed ECG tracings from baseline and until 3 days after completion of therapy to determine the progression of QTc and incidence of arrhythmia and mortality.
32407884,Seven patients required premature termination of therapy.
32407884,This risk mandates careful consideration of HY/AZ therapy in lights of its unproven efficacy.
32407959,SARS-CoV-2 is causing an increasing number of deaths worldwide because no effective treatment is currently available.
32407959,Remdesivir has shown in vitro activity against coronaviruses and is a possible antiviral treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32408070,Currently, drug repurposing is an alternative to novel drug development for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.
32408155,Fingolimod is used for immune therapy in patients with multiple sclerosis.
32408155,Long-term treatment is associated with a small increase in the risk of herpes virus reactivation and respiratory tract infections.
32408155,Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) under Fingolimod treatment have not been described.
32408155,We report a 57-year old female patient with a relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis under fingolimod treatment who experienced a severe COVID-19 infection in March 2020 (Extended Disability Status Scale: 2.0).
32408155,Having peripheral lymphopenia typical for fingolimod treatment (total lymphocytes 0.39/nL [reference range 1.22-3.56]), the patient developed bilateral interstitial pneumonia with multiple ground-glass opacities on chest CT.
32408155,Fingolimod medication was stopped.
32408156,These results will provide a helpful reference for diagnosis and clinical treatment of COVID-19 patients.
32408336,However, treatment options and a cellular understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection are lacking.
32408336,Furthermore, our findings provide insight for the development of therapy options for COVID-19.
32408338,A suitable small animal model is needed to support vaccine and therapy development.
32408391,A recent paper by Tang et al. [2] in this journal reported that heparin treatment reduced mortality of COVID-19 patients with elevated D-dimer; similar preliminary results have been reported elsewhere [3].
32408508,COVID-19 patients management requires availability of sufficiently large number of Intensive Care Units (ICUs) beds.
32408730,Patients receiving hemodialysis are more vulnerable to viral transmission because their immune functions are impaired and they receive treatment within a narrow space.
32408730,Calling on previous experience with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome during the 2015 outbreak, the joint committee of the Korean Society of Nephrology and the Korean Society of Dialysis Therapy quickly formed a COVID-19 task force team to develop a manual before the first index case was diagnosed in the hemodialysis unit.
32408730,The areas of infection control covered by these guidelines include standard precautions, performing dialysis therapy for confirmed or suspected cases, performing cohort isolation for contact patients, and disease monitoring and contact surveillance.
32408842,Care for patients with cancer is particularly important given increased infection rates and worse outcomes from COVID-19 in this patient population, as well as potential adverse outcomes if treatment pathways need to be compromised.
32408842,Specifically, we highlight challenges related to safe handling of hazardous drugs and maintaining high-quality medication safety standards that have impacted various stakeholders.
32409150,Chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine (chloroquine) plus azithromycin is considered as therapy for COVID-19.
32409150,We included autoimmune disease patients aged ≥18 years initiating azithromycin or amoxicillin for ≥5 days during chloroquine treatment.
32409150,Covariates were adjusted using stabilized inverse probability treatment weighting.
32409434,At this time, there is no clinical evidence to suggest that treatment with RAS inhibitors should be discontinued in stable patients with COVID-19.
32409436,Treatment of COVID-19 for patients with underlying ILD or sarcoidosis may include hospital admission, possible drug treatment, caution with steroids, and avoidance of mechanical ventilation in acute exacerbation of ILD.
32409438,At present, there are no firm guidelines for the treatment of COVID-19-related emotional distress.
32409439,Anti-IL-6 drugs are being widely used experimentally and as off-label therapy for patients with COVID-19 who are sick and deteriorating but have a reasonable chance of recovering, but they are still unproven and unapproved for this use.
32409440,Cardiac imaging should only be ordered if its benefits outweigh its risks, with anticipated changes in acute treatment and outcomes, and no suitable alternative of sufficient adequacy is available.
32409486,Hydroxychloroquine at a dose of 600 mg/day within 48 hours of admission to hospital (treatment group) versus standard care without hydroxychloroquine (control group).
32409486,Analyses were adjusted for confounding factors by inverse probability of treatment weighting.
32409486,In the main analysis, 84 patients who received hydroxychloroquine within 48 hours of admission to hospital (treatment group) were compared with 89 patients who did not receive hydroxychloroquine (control group).
32409486,In the weighted analyses, the survival rate without transfer to the intensive care unit at day 21 was 76% in the treatment group and 75% in the control group (weighted hazard ratio 0.9, 95% confidence interval 0.4 to 2.1).
32409486,Overall survival at day 21 was 89% in the treatment group and 91% in the control group (1.2, 0.4 to 3.3).
32409486,Survival without acute respiratory distress syndrome at day 21 was 69% in the treatment group compared with 74% in the control group (1.3, 0.7 to 2.6).
32409486,At day 21, 82% of patients in the treatment group had been weaned from oxygen compared with 76% in the control group (weighted risk ratio 1.1, 95% confidence interval 0.9 to 1.3).
32409486,Eight patients in the treatment group (10%) experienced electrocardiographic modifications that required discontinuation of treatment.
32409486,Hydroxychloroquine has received worldwide attention as a potential treatment for covid-19 because of positive results from small studies.
32409502,Compared with normal weight patients, those who were overweight had 1.84-fold odds of developing severe COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR] 1.84, 95% CI 0.99-3.43, <i>P</i> = 0.05), while those who were obese were at 3.40-fold odds of developing severe disease (OR 3.40, 95% CI 1.40-2.86, <i>P</i> = 0.007), after adjusting for age, sex, epidemiological characteristics, days from disease onset to hospitalization, presence of hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, liver disease and cancer, and drug used for treatment.
32409502,As the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 may continue to spread worldwide, clinicians should pay close attention to obese patients, who should be carefully managed with prompt and aggressive treatment.
32409561,Multicentre, open label, randomised controlled trial. 16 government designated covid-19 treatment centres in China, 11 to 29 February 2020. 150 patients admitted to hospital with laboratory confirmed covid-19 were included in the intention to treat analysis (75 patients assigned to hydroxychloroquine plus standard of care, 75 to standard of care alone).
32409561,Hydroxychloroquine administrated at a loading dose of 1200 mg daily for three days followed by a maintenance dose of 800 mg daily (total treatment duration: two or three weeks for patients with mild to moderate or severe disease, respectively).
32409832,This Viewpoint summarizes the strong scientific arguments supporting the use of alisporivir, a non-immunosuppressive analogue of cyclosporine A with potent cyclophilin inhibition properties that has reached Phase 3 clinical development, for the treatment of COVID-19.
32410003,Insights in pathophysiological mechanisms of less severity in children could be important for devising therapeutics for high-risk adults and elderly.
32410206,The following data were obtained from electronic medical records: demographics, medical history, exposure history, underlying comorbidities, symptoms, signs, laboratory findings, computer tomography scans, and treatment measures.
32410206,The outcome of treatment indicated that in patients with the common-type COVID-19, interferon-α2b, but not novaferon, had some benefits, antibiotics treatment was not needed, and corticosteroids should be used cautiously.
32410206,We observed some treatment benefits with interferon-α2b and corticosteroid therapies but not with novaferon and antibiotic treatment in our study population.
32410245,After treatment, two patients met the standard and were discharged.
32410319,We also call for guidelines for management and treatment as well as research to understand the epidemiology of coinfection This article is protected by copyright.
32410413,To identify predictors of pulmonary fibrosis development by combining follow-up thin-section CT findings and clinical features in patients discharged after treatment for COVID-19.
32410413,10.0 days, <i>p</i> = 0.001), pulsed steroid therapy (11.0 days vs.
32410413,5.0 days, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and antiviral therapy (12.0 days vs.
32410714,Of all the studied patients, 85 (37.6%) received invasive mechanical ventilation, including 14 (6.2%) treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) at the same time, 20 (8.8%) received noninvasive mechanical ventilation, and 24 (10.6%) received continuous renal replacement therapy.
32410760,The two groups differed in disease incidence (group 1 <i>vs</i> group 2, 0·3 <i>vs</i> ten per month), mean age (3·0 <i>vs</i> 7·5 years), cardiac involvement (two of 19 <i>vs</i> six of ten), KDSS (zero of 19 <i>vs</i> five of ten), MAS (zero of 19 <i>vs</i> five of ten), and need for adjunctive steroid treatment (three of 19 <i>vs</i> eight of ten; all p&lt;0·01).
32410772,Vaccines for this deadly virus are currently under development and many drugs used for other indications have been repurposed and investigated for prophylaxis and treatment of COVID 19.
32410772,As per SOLIDARITY trial by WHO, some of the most promising candidates include chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine which are anti-malarial medications, Remdesivir, Lopinavir-Ritonavir combination with or without interferon which are anti-HIV drugs and convalescent plasma therapy.
32410772,The situation is still evolving and hence there is yet no definitive therapy but to conclude the use of repurposed medications can be a boon till a definitive therapy and vaccines are developed.
32410913,The aim of this article is to provide basic consolidated guidance and checklists to clinicians in the neonatal intensive care units in key aspects of preparation needed to counter exposure or infection with COVID-19.
32411313,Here, we report on the treatment of eight severe COVID-19 pneumonia patients-- seven hospitalized in intensive care units (ICUs) in Greece and one non-ICU patient in the Netherlands-- with the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist Anakinra.
32411313,At the end-of-treatment, ICU patients had less need for vasopressors, significantly improved respiratory function and lower HScore.
32411315,Current emergency unit asthma guidelines recommend bronchodilators be administered by metered dose inhaler (MDI) and spacer for mild-moderate asthma and include it as a choice even in severe asthma, but many emergency units continue to prefer nebulised therapy for patients who urgently require beta-agonists.
32411315,The utilization of nebulised therapy potentially increases the risk of aerosolization of the coronavirus.
32411315,Since nosocomial transmission of respiratory pathogens is a major threat in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, use of nebulised therapy is of even greater concern due to the potential increased risk of infection spread to nearby patients and health-care workers.
32411315,We propose a risk stratification plan that aims to avoid nebulised therapy, when possible, by providing an algorithm to help better delineate those who require nebulised therapy.
32411315,Furthermore, expedient treatment of patients with high dose MDI therapy augmented with more rapid initiation of systemic therapy may help ensure patients are less likely to deteriorate to the stage where nebulisers are required.
32411566,Yet, they have also been utilized in the treatment of various pulmonary disorders with vasoconstriction.
32411566,Patients treated with a CCB were significantly more likely to survive than those not treated with a CCB: 12 (50%) survived and 12 expired in the CCB group vs. six (14.6%) that survived and 35 (85.4%) that expired in the No-CCB treatment group (P&lt;.01; p=0.0036).
32411566,Only one patient (4.2%) was intubated in the CCB group whereas 16 (39.0%) were intubated in the No-CCB treatment group (P&lt;.01; p=0.0026).
32411566,Including either nifedipine or amlodipine in medication regimens for elderly patients with hypertension hospitalized for COVID-19 may be considered.
32411619,The availability of pathogen-specific treatment options for respiratory tract infections (RTIs) increased the need for rapid diagnostic tests.
32411619,In this review, we summarize recently published characteristics of POCTs and discuss their implications for the treatment of RTIs.
32411770,Here, we attempt to describe the clinical characteristics and treatment experiences of discharged cases from Taizhou, China.
32411770,All patients received combined antiviral treatment on admission, including β-interferon, lopinavir/tonavir, Abidol and oseltamivir.

32417709,Currently, since there is no proven and effective antiviral therapy for SARS-CoV-2, the efforts should focus on controlling inflammatory response and reduce the risks of associated complications.
32417870,Treatment of the infected requires decisions in resource constraint situation particularly ICU beds and ventilators.
32418028,These observations warrant further well-designed studies, yet we believe it is time for a global consideration of sampling all asymptomatic patients before surgical treatment.
32418114,All 550 patients received comparable basic treatments including antiviral drugs and antibiotics, and 48 of them were treated with oral HCQ treatment (200 mg twice a day for 7-10 days) in addition to the basic treatments.
32418114,The levels of inflammatory cytokine IL-6 were significantly reduced from 22.2 (8.3-118.9) pg mL<sup>-1</sup> at the beginning of the treatment to 5.2 (3.0-23.4) pg mL<sup>-1</sup> (P&lt;0.05) at the end of the treatment in the HCQ group but there is no change in the NHCQ group.
32418114,Therefore, HCQ should be prescribed as a part of treatment for critically ill COVID-19 patients, with possible outcome of saving lives. hydroxychloroquine, IL-6, mortalities, COVID-19.
32418146,Main themes encompassed testing strategies and results (n = 4), changes in use of current therapeutics (n = 3), preventive measurements of transmission and management of COVID-19 (n = 3), and changes in standard clinical care (n = 3).

32418728,Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have an optional prescription status that has resulted in frequent use, in particular for the symptomatic treatment of fever and non-rheumatic pain.
32418728,First, the clinical observations of the French Pharmacovigilance Network showed that severe bacterial infections can occur even after a short NSAID treatment, and even if the NSAID is associated with an antibiotic.
32418728,Therefore, in case of infection, symptomatic treatment with NSAIDs for non-severe symptoms (fever, pain, or myalgia) is not to be recommended, given a range of clinical and scientific arguments supporting an increased risk of severe bacterial complication.
32418773,A proposal to adapt treatment strategies was made for the main GI oncology situations.

32427166,One of the many questions with respect to controlling the novel coronavirus pandemic is whether existing drugs can be re-purposed (re-positioned) for the prevention or treatment of Covid-19 - or for any future epidemic.
32427166,Proposed here is a new but simple concept that would capitalize on the opportunity presented by the on-going natural experiment involving the collection of data from epidemiological surveillance screening and diagnostic testing for clinical treatment.
32427171,(2) Provide supplemental oxygen following usual treatment principles for hypoxic respiratory failure.
32427173,Given this potential, it is imperative that emergency clinicians understand the preliminary data behind the dynamics of this disease, recognize possible presentations of patients, and understand proposed treatment modalities.
32427192,The treatment of patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), including SARS-CoV‑2 infections, should continue to be based on evidence-based CAP guidelines during the pandemic.
32427192,The treatment of patients with chronic lung diseases must be adapted during the pandemic, but must still be guaranteed.
32427206,The study deals with the statistical comparison and visualization of country-based real-data for the period December 31, 2019, up to April 12, 2020, and does not intend to address the medical treatment of the disease.
32427279,There is no proven antiviral or immunomodulatory therapy for COVID-19.
32427279,The disease progression associated with the pro-inflammatory host response prompted us to examine the role of early corticosteroid therapy in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19.
32427279,This treatment effect was observed within each individual component of the composite endpoint.
32427361,These HIV infected patients were compliant with their HIV medication regimen and had robust CD4 T cell counts.
32427613,Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation might be an effective salvage treatment for patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pneumonia associated with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome.
32427632,Various healthcare systems have been forced to postpone treatment for many urological conditions as resources are dedicated to the treatment of COVID-19.
32427773,Here we report a case series of five patients suffering from profound, medically refractory COVID-19 associated respiratory failure who were treated with fibrinolytic therapy using tissue plasminogen activator (tPA, Alteplase).
32427774,All patients received protocol directed thrombolytic therapy with Tissue Plasminogen Activator (tPA).
32427774,All five patients improved without deleterious effects of thrombolytic therapy.
32427774,Ventilator support was weaned immediately on post-treatment day 1 and he was extubated on post treatment day 12.
32427774,Our second through fifth patients were not intubated at time of initiation of tPA therapy.
32427774,After tPA therapy, all patients demonstrated a noticeable increase in PaO2 values overtime.
32427774,Clinical trials of thrombolytic therapy would further serve to underscore the efficacy and utility of this therapy.
32428072,In response to the accelerated increase in the number of COVID-19 cases, countries must increase their supply of beds in intensive care units (ICUs).
32428144,In severe cases, the use of medications such as hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin or medication can be promising.
32428242,If we embrace the challenges that will emerge in the post-pandemic environment, the treatment delivered to patients could be more cost effective and better tailored than before.
32428245,Together, these actions have enabled treatment of all those needing hospital care for COVID-19 and avoided the unfettered increase in mortality that would have accompanied an overwhelmed healthcare service.
32428290,This article presents a case of a pregnant woman from Wuhan infected with SARS-CoV-2, including her symptoms, pregnancy outcome, and treatment strategy.
32428372,Until an effective treatment or a vaccine is developed, the current recommendations are to contain the disease, and control its transmission.
32428372,By virtue of the nature of the practice of dentistry where intrinsically, a high volume of aerosols are produced, as well as the close proximity of dentists and patients during treatment, dentists and allied health staff are considered the highest risk health professional group for acquiring SARS-CoV-2 during patient management.
32428379,The quest for the effective treatment against COVID-19 pneumonia caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is hampered by the lack of knowledge concerning the basic cell biology of the infection.
32428835,This review aimed to provide assistance for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.
32428865,In absence of any effective treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19), remdesivir has been tried for a compassionate use in severe COVID-19.
32428909,Due to the exponential growth of the number of subjects affected by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the entire Italian health care system had to respond promptly and in a very short time with the need of semi-intensive and intensive care units.
32428909,The presentation of this paper is the result of a consensus promoted by the Italian societies of respiratory health care professionals who contacted pulmonologists directly involved in the treatment and rehabilitation of COVID-19.
32428909,Two main areas of intervention were identified: organization and treatment, which are described in this paper to face the emergency.
32428957,Intubation and mechanical ventilation of the male patient with prolonged intenive care treatment.
32428957,Recovery of the female patient under conventional oxygen therapy.
32429099,PLP inhibitors have been evaluated during past coronavirus epidemics, and have showed promising results as an antiviral therapy in vitro.
32429099,In this review, we recapitulate the roles of PLPs in coronavirus infections, report a list of PLP inhibitors and suggest possible therapeutic strategies for COVID-19 treatment, using both clinical and preclinical drugs.
32429249,This is a subjective analysis of literature concerning specific topics raised in our daily practice (e.g., clinical features of COVID-19 patients; ventilation of the critically ill COVID-19 patient; diagnostic of infection with SARS-CoV-2; stability of the virus; Covid-19 in specific patient populations, e.g., paediatrics, immunosuppressed patients, patients with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, kidney or liver disease; co-medication with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); antiviral treatment) and we believe that these answers help colleagues in clinical decision-making.
32429249,With ongoing treatment of severely ill COVID-19 patients other questions will come up.
32429580,Remdesivir is a nucleotide prodrug that is currently undergoing extensive clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19.
32429774,These patients are commonly treated with anticoagulation and/or antiplatelet medications and less commonly thrombolysis during hospitalization, potentially with great benefit but management of these medications can be difficult in potentially critically ill patients.In this paper, we review the current guidelines, consensus statements, and emerging evidence for a wide range of cardiovascular disease states with special focus on anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy.
32429774,Our goal is to provide guidance for treatment of the cardiovascular patient with COVID-19 in the face of a rapidly evolving understanding of this virus and its complications.Preamble:Anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapies are a major cause of inpatient morbidity and mortality.
32429774,In an effort to align practice patterns across a large health system (Jefferson Health 2,622 staffed inpatient beds and 319 intensive care unit (ICU) beds across 14 facilities), a task force was assembled to address the utilization of anti-thrombotic and anti-platelet therapy in COVID-19 positive or suspected patients.
32429774,Our deliberations and treatment recommendations are summarized here.Objective:To provide guidance to the utilization of antithrombotic and antiplatelet therapies in patients with known or suspected COVID-19.
32430286,They have also been proposed for the treatment of several viral infections, due to their anti-viral effects in cell cultures and animal models, and, currently, for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the pandemic severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by coronavirus 2 (Sars-Cov-2) infection that is spreading all over the world.
32430286,Although in some recent studies a clinical improvement in COVID-19 patients has been observed, the clinical efficacy of CQ and HCQ in COVID-19 has yet to be proven with randomized controlled studies, many of which are currently ongoing, also considering pharmacokinetics, optimal dosing regimen, therapeutic level and duration of treatment and taking into account patients with different severity degrees of disease.
32430286,Here we review what is currently known on the mechanisms of action of CQ and HCQ as anti-viral, anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic drugs and discuss the up-to-date experimental evidence on the potential mechanisms of action of CQ/HCQ in Sars-Cov2 infection and the current clinical knowledge on their efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19 patients.
32430428,The duration of viral shedding is central to guide the decisions of isolation precautions and antiviral treatment.
32430428,However, studies regarding the risk factors associated with prolonged SARS-CoV-2 shedding and the impact of Lopinavir/Ritonavir (LPV/r) treatment on viral shedding remain scarce.
32430428,We compared clinical characteristics and SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding between patients initiated with LPV/r treatment and those without.
32430428,Of 120 patients, the median age was 52 years, 54 (45%) were male and 78 (65%) received LPV/r treatment.
32430428,Older age (odd ratio [OR] 1.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00-1.05, p=0.03) and the lack of LPV/r treatment (OR 2.42, 95% CI 1.10-5.36, p=0.029) were independent risk factors of prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding.
32430428,Patients who initiated LPV/r treatment within 10 days from symptom onset, but not initiated from day 11 onwards, had significantly shorter viral shedding duration compared with those without LPV/r treatment (median 19 days <i>versus</i> 28.5 days, Log-rank p&lt;0.001).
32430428,Older age and the lack of LPV/r treatment were independently associated with prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding in patients with COVID-19.
32430428,Earlier administration of LPV/r treatment could shorten viral shedding duration.
32430429,Timely diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is a prerequisite for treatment and prevention.
32430456,Despite that all patients were on standard treatment for Covid-19 infection, IL-6 and D-dimer levels persisted higher in patients with hyperglycemia during hospitalization.
32430617,In vitro, in vivo, or preliminary trials of these drugs in the treatment of COVID-19 have been encouraging, leading to new research projects and trials to find the best drug/s.
32430617,COVID-19 therapy must be based on expert clinical experience and published literature and guidelines from major health organizations.
32430651,In clinical practice, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are extensively used for the treatment of hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases.
32430996,There is an urgency to understand the mechanism by which this virus causes complications so as to develop treatment options.
32430996,Curcumin, a natural polyphenolic compound, could be a potential treatment option for patients with coronavirus disease.
32430996,This review provides a basis for further research and development of clinical applications of curcumin for the treatment of newly emerged SARS-CoV-2.
32431119,The implications of the outbreak are similar in many countries, among others, due to the uncertainty regarding the way the virus spreads, the appropriate treatment, the lack of vaccination and the high rate of deaths.
32431134,Remodelled tasks in charge of RPTs were: oxygen therapy daily monitoring, non invasive ventilation (NIV) and continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) delivery, pronation and postural changes to improve oxygenation, reconditioning with leg/arm cranking and exercises, initial and final patients' functional assessment by short-physical performance battery (SPPB) and 1-minute sit-to-stand test (1-STS) to evaluate motor conditions and exercise-induced oxygen desaturation.
32431134,As main topics, RPTs have been involved in oxygen therapy management in almost a third of the admitted patients, reconditioning exercises in 60% of the cases, and initial and final functional motor capacity assessment in all patients.
32431755,If successful, this therapy may attenuate the cytokine storm observed in these patients and potentially reduce mortality, increase ventilation free days, improve oxygenation parameters and consequently lessen the burden on patients and the intensive care unit.
32431756,The concept can easily be adopted to other patient care areas, including perioperative and intensive care units.
32431992,Several alternatives in treatment options have been assessed and used in this patient population.
32431992,While some studies have shown a high mortality rate despite aggressive treatment, such as in our case, the lack of large sample size studies and treatment alternatives places healthcare providers against a wall without options in patients with severe refractory ARDS due to COVID-19.
32432121,During this study, a total of 173 patients (64.08%) were recovered after treatment. <b>Conclusion:</b> In some epidemiological backgrounds, CT imaging manifestations and evolutionary characteristics are of great significance for early warning of lung injury, assessment of disease severity, and assistance in clinical typing and post-treatment follow-up.
32432127,Knowledge of these risks will allow informed decisions regarding appropriate therapeutics and monitoring to keep our patients safe.
32432445,The reasons for this particular susceptibility are to be found in the compromised immune system, secondary to chronic malnutrition, immunosuppressive therapy, and uremia, frequent contact with healthcare personnel and other patients attending the dialysis unit and in need of the presence of other family members during treatment.
32432527,Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has sparked much interest in the therapeutics of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
32432995,During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, infectious disease control is of utmost importance in acute stroke treatment.
32432995,Herein, we are describing our experience with simulation training for COVID-19 stroke treatment protocols.
32432998,Inpatient stroke pathways and treatment time metrics nevertheless did not differ between the 2 groups (<i>P</i>&gt;0.05 for all comparisons).
32433010,We urgently need to find treatment and vaccine to stop the epidemic.
32433217,The review discusses the existing challenges of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics and the potential application of translational technology for epidemiological predictions, patient monitoring and treatment decision-making in COVID-19.
32433248,The available technology has several advantages including: a) facilitating appropriate paperless documentation and communication between all healthcare givers working in isolation rooms or large isolation areas; b) testing patients and staff at the bedside using smart point of care diagnostics (SPOCD) to confirm COVID-19 infection; c) allowing diagnostics and treatment at the bedside through point of care ultrasound (POCUS) and Thromboelastography (TEG); d) adapting the use of anaesthetic machines and the use of volatile anaesthetics.
32433291,: Treatment of the COVID-19 critically ill patient requires oxygenation and ventilation support for prolonged periods which seem unique for viral pneumonia.
32433343,Without effective treatment and vaccination, the strategies to restrain this disease is only keeping social distance, maintaining personal hygiene, quarantine and isolation.
32433343,However, thrice-a-week treatment is inevitable for all hemodialysis patients.
32433345,As the SARS-CoV-2 infection pandemic proceeds, many efforts are being dedicated to the development of diverse treatment strategies.
32433363,In an attempt to reduce preventable harm to individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD), federal, state, and local governments have temporarily modified law and policy to increase access to OUD treatment and divert some individuals at high risk away from the correctional system.
32433363,In this Commentary, we briefly describe how people with OUD are at increased risk for COVID-19, discuss existing policy barriers to evidence-based prevention and treatment for individuals with OUD, explain the temporary rollbacks of those barriers, and argue that these changes should be made permanent.
32433364,To reduce the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), many substance use disorder treatment programs have transitioned to telemedicine.
32433364,We describe 2 cases where telemedicine was combined with street outreach to connect patients experiencing homelessness with OUD to treatment.
32433364,These cases highlight an important opportunity to provide access to life-saving OUD treatment for vulnerable patients in the setting of a pandemic that mandates reduced face-to-face clinical interactions.
32434108,From 23rd February to 31st March 2020, 1257 patients on active anticancer treatment for oncological or haematological malignancies attended our institution.
32434108,In conclusion, following our practical health vigilance recommendations, physicians should be confident in maintaining life-saving anticancer treatment without exceedingly increasing the risk of nosocomial COVID-19 infection.
32434108,The high rate of mortality suggested that all patients on active anticancer treatment with flu-like symptoms have to be carefully screened for COVID-19 infection.
32434211,High levels of IL-6 and IL-8 during treatment were observed in patients with severe or critical disease and correlated with decreased lymphocyte count.
32434314,While acute care and intensive care units are the main pillars of the early response to the disease, rehabilitative medicine should play an important part in allowing COVID-19 survivors to reduce disability and optimize the function of acute hospital setting.
32434314,We analyze all these consequences and propose some practical treatment options, based on current evidence and clinical experience, as well as several suggestions for management of rehabilitation services and patients with suspected or confirmed infection by SARS-CoV-2.
32434337,Current potential treatment options include hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir and convalescent plasma.
32434402,Globally implementing preventive and controlling measures, and cultivating coping and resilience are challenging factors; modified lifestyle (lockdown curfew, self-isolation, social distancing and quarantine); conspiracy theories, misinformation and disinformation about the origin, scale, signs, symptoms, transmission, prevention and treatment; global socioeconomic crisis; travel restrictions; workplace hazard control; postponement and cancellation of religious, sports, cultural and entertainment events; panic buying and hoarding; incidents of racism, xenophobia, discrimination, stigma, psychological pressure of productivity, marginalization and violence; overwhelmed medical centers and health organizations, and general impact on education, politics, socioeconomic, culture, environment and climate - are some of the risk factors to aggravate further problems.
32434596,The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the traditional practice of psychiatric assessment and treatment via face to face interaction.
32434606,In ADMiRE, there has been a significant reduction of face to face consultations, postponement of new assessments, difficulties with physical monitoring, delays in medication initiation, suspension of medication titration, lack of group interventions and problems with access to controlled drug prescriptions.
32434611,These improved outcomes are a result of reducing delays to treatment and the provision of specialized, holistic interventions.
32434611,The covid-19 pandemic poses significant challenges to the delivery of these services, such as undetected cases or long delays to treatment.
32434627,A cornerstone of therapy is the work in the community through further education and community organisations.
32434632,The National Emergency Medical Rescue Team of the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, together with other 13 medical teams (841 medical staff in total), have fulfilled the task for the treatment of non-severe COVID-19 patients, without any medical staff infected.
32434634,All 23 children received antiviral therapy and were recovered.
32434635,This article reports the diagnosis and treatment of two children with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and hypertension.
32434728,The adjusted model focused on comprehensive and rapid acute stroke treatment, reduction of exposure to the healthcare team, and preservation of PPE.
32434788,To date, there is no effective treatment.
32434789,The impact of ICI therapy on the severity of acute coronavirus infection symptomatology warrants further exploration.
32434789,Although we do not have data on the impact of ICI therapy on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) symptomatology, a possible interaction should be considered when deciding on dosing in patients with possible SARS-CoV-2 exposure or when evaluating patients with presumed ICI-related pneumonitis during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32434790,One important clinical question is how to manage patients who need anticancer therapy, including immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) during these conditions.
32434790,In particular, we consider the impact of ICI on COVID-19 severity, decisions surrounding continuing or interrupting therapy, diagnostic measures in patients with symptoms or manifestations potentially consistent with either COVID-19 or ICI toxicity, and resumption of therapy in infected patients.
32434798,Based on a multi-institutional collaborative effort, we describe best practices when providing neurosurgical treatment for patients with covid-19 in order to optimize clinical care and minimize the exposure of patients and staff.
32434805,Specific recommendations by national organizations and institution specific step-by-step guidelines and education materials are required to maintain safety for both patients and caregivers perioperatively, with transport, and medication management.
32435065,In about 20% of patients, severe symptoms occur after a mean incubation period of 5 - 6 days; 5% of patients need intensive care therapy.
32435065,Therapy is based on established recommendations issued for patients with acute lung injury (ARDS).
32435065,Lung protective ventilation, prone position, restrictive fluid management and adequate management of organ failure are the mainstays of therapy.
32435268,Many concerns have arisen about the management and treatment of children with cancer while researchers are wondering how to deal with this devastating pandemic.
32435272,A total of 8 patients received combined therapy of traditional Chinese medicines and western medicines.
32435272,From the clinical outcomes of these 8 patients, western combined therapy of traditional Chinese medicine was indeed an effective treatment method.
32435272,D-dimmer rise, infection index rise, and chest CT(computed tomography) progression may be clinical warning indicators for severe patients, in our study, more 50% of patients had elevated levels of these indicators, but only 44% (including the dead) of patients had received treatment in the intensive care unit. 5 (56%) ordinary type patients had been discharged, while the 1 (11%) critical type patient died 3 days after admission.
32435272,Cancer comorbidity seems to have no direct relationship with severe events, and the combination of traditional Chinese medicine and western medicine may be effective in the prevention and treatment of novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia (NICP).
32435607,Unfortunately, there is no specific prevention and treatment strategy for this disease.
32435867,Glycemic control during infectious diseases is often suboptimal, and antidiabetic drugs and insulin therapy have to be adapted accordingly.
32435867,On the other hand, access of diabetes patients to outpatient clinics are limited during the ongoing season urging alternative treatment options, particularly the implementation of novel telemedicine strategies.
32435870,Currently, treatment is supportive.
32435879,None required oxygen therapy, and 7 could be managed as outpatients.
32435882,Our objective was to show that indomethacin could be considered as a promising candidate for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 and to provide criteria for comparing benefits of alternative dosage regimens using a model-based approach.
32435882,The treatment with the SR formulation at the dose of 75 mg twice-a-day is expected to achieve a complete response in three days for the treatment in patients infected by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.
32435882,These results suggest that indomethacin could be considered as a promising candidate for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 whose potential therapeutic effect need to be further assessed in a prospective clinical trial.
32435920,Since its introduction in modern medicine, naturalistic observations emerged about possible uses of lithium treatment for conditions different from recurring affective disorders, for which it is still a first-line treatment option.
32435920,In fact, treatment with lithium requires continuous monitoring of its serum levels in order to prevent acute toxicity and long-term side effects, most notably affecting the kidney and thyroid.
32436029,While there is no specific recommended treatment for COVID-19, nitric oxide has the potential to be of therapeutic value for managing acute respiratory distress syndrome in patients with COVID-19.
32436029,Given the extent of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the large numbers of hospitalized patients requiring respiratory support, clinical use of inhaled nitric oxide may become an alternate rescue therapy before extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for the management of acute respiratory distress syndrome in patients with COVID-19.
32436445,Convalescent blood products are the most promising potential treatment for use in COVID-19.
32436581,The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) pandemic is causing an increased need for mechanical ventilation for a significant percentage of people who present to the hospital for treatment.
32436994,Mean (SD) levels of c-reactive protein (CRP) were significantly decreased following treatment 24.6 (26.9) mg/L compared to baseline 140.4 (77) mg/L (P&lt; 0.0001).
32436994,Ongoing randomized control trials will allow for further evaluation of this promising therapy.
32437000,A 34 year old HIV-positive female on antiretroviral therapy (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, lamivudine and efavirenz) for 5 years, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent for coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19).
32437004,SARS-CoV-2 can cause liver injury through systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), cytokine storms, ischemia-reperfusion injury, side effects of treatment drugs, and underlying liver disease and can attack liver cells directly via ACE2.
32437004,Liver injury may be a risk factor for progresses and worsens in patients with COVID-19, and it is necessary to pay attention to the occurrence of liver injury in the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.
32437014,Ozone may exert its antiviral actions and ozone therapy has been demonstrated therapeutically usefulness in influenza and novel viruses.
32437014,In this letter, two severe cases with COVID-19 received ozone therapy were described.
32437014,The results showed that ozone therapy may promote recovery of clinical condition and improvement of chest CT images, shorten the duration of viral shedding and length of hospital stay.
32437017,All 18 patients were eventually discharged, including the 3 severe patients who recovered after treatment with non-invasive mechanical ventilation, convalescent plasma and other therapies.
32437019,Currently, there are no approved therapies for the treatment of COVID-19.
32437019,With most of the world on lockdown and the looming threat of millions of deaths, there is immense pressure to find a therapy for this disease.
32437024,1,2) Unfortunately, even after six months since its first detection, we still do not have any definitive treatment options for COVID-19 pneumonia.
32437032,While no single management algorithm for head and neck cancer can be universally implemented, a detailed examination of these issues is necessary to formulate ethically sound treatment strategies.
32437052,Monitoring case fatality in Belgium, the Netherlands and Sweden, and treatment successes in Germany and Austria play an utmost importance.
32437381,COVID-19 discussions often focus on intensive care units in hospitals.
32437675,This report shows feasibility for surgical treatment of acute aortic disease in patients with COVID-19.
32437696,Whether a mobile cabin hospital can provide a safe treatment site for patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms remains unknown.
32437696,Mobile cabin hospitals provide a safe treatment site for patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms, and provide an effective isolation area to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
32437739,This pilot study provides the first evidence of the safety of anti-IL-1 treatment with highdose IV anakinra in 5 patients, who experienced a positive outcome.
32437770,Unfortunately, there is lack of evidence about the optimal management of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), even less in patients on maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) therapy than in the general population.
32437770,Among the 36 patients, 18 had worsening of their clinical status, as defined by severe hypoxia with oxygen therapy requirements greater than 4 Liters/minute and radiological worsening.
32437797,Furthermore, we focused on possible therapeutic options such as repurposing drugs including antimalarials, antivirals, antiparasitic drugs, and anti-HIV drugs, as well as monoclonal antibodies, vaccines as potential treatment options.
32437797,Also we have summarized the latest research progress on the usage of stem cell therapy, human convalescent serum, interferon's, in the treatment of COVID-19.
32437820,We opine that one of these treatment options is low dose radiation therapy for severe and most critical cases.
32437934,Relevant inflammatory cytokine storm is associated with severity of disease and IL1 inhibition is a cornerstone treatment for hyperinflammatory diseases.
32437942,Comprehensive palliative care should be an explicit part of both national and global COVID-19 response plans.
32437942,Therefore, we aimed to identify, review and compare national and international COVID-19 guidance for nursing homes concerning palliative care, issued by government bodies and professional associations.
32437942,We identified 21 eligible documents covering both nursing homes and palliative care; from the World Health Organization (n=3), and eight individual countries: USA (n=7), the Netherlands (n=2), Ireland (n=1), United Kingdom (n=3), Switzerland (n=3), New Zealand (n=1), Belgium (n=1).
32437942,International documents focused primarily on infection prevention and control, including only a few sentences on palliative care related topics.
32437942,Palliative care themes most frequently mentioned across documents were end-of-life visits, advance care planning documentation, and clinical decision-making towards the end of life (focusing on hospital transfers).
32437942,There is a dearth of comprehensive international COVID-19 guidance on palliative care for nursing homes.
32437942,Key aspects of palliative care, i.e. symptom management, staff education and support, referral to specialist services or hospice, and family support, need greater attention in future guidelines.
32437946,Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, gender-nonconforming, and queer/questioning-identified (LGBTQ+) persons are particularly vulnerable to health inequities across settings, including palliative care and at the end of life.
32437946,There is a crucial gap in the literature pertaining to palliative care for LGBTQ+ populations during COVID-19.
32438018,Daily ECG monitoring and other risk mitigation strategies should be considered in order to prevent possible harms from what is currently an unproven therapy.
32438240,One of the most disturbing issues is Covid-19 treatment; although a large number of medications, previously used successfully with other viruses (including Chinese herbal medicines and anti-malaria drugs), are under consideration, there remain questions as to whether they can play a satisfactory role for this disease.
32438240,Global attempts are ongoing to find the drugs for the treatment of this virus but none of the antiviral drugs used for treatment of other human viral infection is working and hence attempts to find new drugs are continuing.
32438256,Still, clinicians should combine radiology and laboratory methods to achieve a higher detection rate, so that instant isolation and treatment could be effectively conducted to curb the rampant spread of the epidemic.
32438328,This systematic review highlights a particularly vulnerable group - obese, and emphasises on the importance of treatment aggression and disease prevention in this population group.
32438329,VR is beneficial for remote sites for exploring telemedicine, planning, treatment, and controlling of the infections by providing proper awareness to the people regarding this disease.
32438330,As on date, no specific treatment is available for devastating COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.
32438330,As per WHO guidelines, the treatment is mainly symptomatic and supportive.
32438330,This clinical protocol has not proven sufficient to save the lives of COVID-19 patients suffering from diabetes or having underlying liver diseases; hence there is utmost need to tackle this situation by other means such as Convalescent Plasma (CP) therapy.
32438330,The CP therapy can be a possible life saving alternative to treat critical COVID-19 patients having diabetes or underlying liver dysfunction.
32438333,The intermingled effects of diabetes with other cardiovascular comorbidities warrant age-specific outcomes data including the impact of ongoing antidiabetic treatment.
32438340,The withdrawal of ATDs and urgent measurement of neutrophils should be considered in case of flu-like manifestations occurring in the initial months of treatment.
32438340,Patients who are on replacement treatment with thyroid hormones should ensure they have sufficient supply of medication.
32438345,Most patients with thyroid nodules and thyroid cancer (TC) referred for diagnostic work-up and treatment are not considered at higher risk of infection from SARS-CoV-2 compared to the general population.
32438345,Accordingly, diagnostic work-up of thyroid nodules, thyroid surgery for either benign or malignant thyroid nodules and radioiodine treatment for differentiated thyroid cancers may be safely postponed during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
32438345,Appropriate patient counselling, however, is mandatory and red flags should be carefully identified prompting immediate evaluation and treatment as appropriate.
32438345,For these selected cases diagnostic work-up (e.g. ultrasound, scintigraphy, fine-needle aspiration), surgery and radioiodine therapy may proceed despite the threat of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19, after an individual risk-benefit analysis.
32438371,Our results enable a detailed analysis of the inhibitory mechanisms that underlie the antiviral activity of substances such as remdesivir, a drug for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)<sup>4</sup>.
32438382,How can we learn from the COVID-19 situation to deliver treatment to individuals who may have difficulties attending traditional clinic-based care, such as those in more rural areas with transport difficulties?
32438383,There is currently no proven treatment for COVID-19 and a safe and effective vaccine is at least a year away.
32438383,The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the virus is unlikely to mutate without loss of pathogenicity and thus represents an attractive target for antiviral treatment.
32438446,There is a rapidly expanding literature on the in vitro antiviral activity of drugs that may be repurposed for therapy or chemoprophylaxis against SARS-CoV-2.
32438454,Currently, a clear relationship between COVID-19 infection incidence and/or complications due to chronic or occasional treatments for other pathologies is still not clear, albeit COVID-19 pandemic may condition the treatment strategy of complex disorders, as osteoarthritis (OA).
32438459,This has created an urgent need to identify effective medications for its prevention and treatment (1).
32438464,We reviewed three reported cases with detailed treatment information from China to better understand the features and associated therapeutic strategies used in transplant recipients with COVID-19.<sup>2-4</sup>.
32438617,The indications for renal replacement therapy for these patients are those commonly accepted to treat AKI.
32438617,We describe a continuous veno-venous haemodialysis (CVVHD) protocol for AKI, which aims to provide the best treatment according to the particular patient's and medical personnels' needs in biohazard settings with limited human and technological resources.
32438703,Thus, special considerations should be taken to prevent infection of older cancer patients and to provide them with adequate social support during their cancer treatment.
32438703,(8) For selected patients, immunotherapy and targeted therapy may become the systemic therapy of choice for older cancer patients and need to be tested in clinical trials.
32438763,Anemia is a frequent manifestation in patients with chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and requires tight monitoring and adequate supplementary therapy.
32438763,Intravenous iron is the first-line treatment in subjects with moderate-severe anemia, active disease, or oral iron intolerance.
32438763,Oral iron, including both the traditional formulations with ferrous iron and the new ferric iron complexes, could constitute a valid alternative for anemia treatment.
32438763,For this reason, we conducted a literature review, to summarize the scientific evidence on oral iron therapy in IBD patients with anemia.
32438839,This manuscript reviews the different aspects of blood purification in critically ill patients with AKI and increased inflammatory factors, and examines its potential role in severe COVID-19 treatment.
32438839,Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) has been practiced in many sepsis patients with AKI.
32438839,Their potential in removing inflammatory factors and other toxins prospects for the treatment of severe COVID-19.
32438878,However, access to the hospital for therapy or for unstable/relapsing patients was not considered postponable.
32438878,At the entrance of the therapy area, a control station was set up in order to double-check all patients with a clinical interview and conduct thermal scanning.
32438878,A total of 1451 IBD patients under biotechnological or experimental therapy actively followed in the CEMAD IBD centre were included in the study.
32438878,About 10% of patients receiving subcutaneous therapy were allowed to collect their medicine without a follow-up visit.
32438878,Finally, 10% of patients living outside the Lazio region requested access to their therapy at a local centre closer to their home.
32439198,Scientist, doctors are searching for effective therapy of this diseases.
32439198,The remdesivir, an antiviral drug, is appeared as 'molecule of hope' for the treatment of this disease.
32439198,USFDA approve this drug for the treatment of COVID-19.
32439237,Transplanted patients have to receive immunosuppressive therapy to prevent rejection.
32439237,Management of immunosuppressive therapy and drug-drug interactions in liver transplant recipients infected with COVID-19 should be cautiously practiced to prevent rejection and effectively treat the underlying infection.
32439366,Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin combination therapy is often prescribed for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32439366,We performed 12‑lead ECGs and 12‑lead 24-h Holter ECG monitoring in all patients aged &lt;80 years admitted to our medical unit for COVID-19, in oral therapy with hydroxychloroquine (200 mg, twice daily) and azithromycin (500 mg, once daily) for at least 3 days.
32439366,ECG after therapy showed longer QTc-interval than before therapy (450 vs 426 ms, p = .02).
32439366,Therapy with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin prolongs QTc interval in patients with COVID-19, particularly in those with high levels of transaminases.
32439516,Given the significant overlap between the core tenets of TIC and accepted guidelines for the provision of quality palliative care (PC), PC teams are particularly well poised to both incorporate such practices into routine care and to argue for their integration across health systems.
32439650,Thrombectomy for large-vessel-occlusion stroke is a highly impactful treatment.
32439821,Further investigation is required to clarify the full clinical spectrum of neurologic symptoms and its optimal treatment.
32440386,Patients with potentially curable cancers are at risk of not receiving timely SOC multidisciplinary treatments, such as surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or combination treatments.
32440386,Additionally, ambulatory efforts to avoid treatment-related morbidity are critical for keeping patients out of emergency departments and hospitals.
32440386,In this review article, we discuss evidence-based radiation therapy approaches for curable cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32440386,We focus on three scenarios of cancer care: 1) radiation therapy as an alternative to surgery when immediate surgery is not possible, 2) radiation therapy as a 'bridge' to surgery, and 3) radiation options definitively or postoperatively, given the risk of hospitalization with high-dose chemotherapy.
32440661,We should pay special attention to early diagnosis and early treatment in children infected with COVID-19.
32440662,In this paper, we review the literature about the common treatment of pemphigus with a focus on the lessons from similar epidemics to find a proper suggestion to manage pemphigus in the COVID-19 pandemic era.
32440662,The effect of many of the drugs used for treatment of Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) on COVID-19 is not clear.
32440883,We discuss in-hospital and post-discharge venous thromboembolism (VTE) prevention, treatment of suspected but unconfirmed VTE, laboratory monitoring of COVID-19, associated anticoagulant therapies, and essential elements for optimized transitions of care specific to patients with COVID-19.
32441196,In many countries the exponential growth of Covid-19 cases is overwhelming health care systems with overcrowding of hospitals and overflowing Intensive Care Units.
32441232,Recognizing the dynamic nature of COVID-19, the protocol addresses the potential investigational treatment options and considerations for special populations.
32441332,Demographic data, clinical findings, laboratory test results, imaging findings, treatment received, and outcomes were collected.
32441332,Forty-one patients (68.6%) required hospital admission (18 due to disease worsening and 23 for delivery) of whom 21 patients (35%) underwent pharmacological treatment, including hydroxychloroquine, antivirals, antibiotics and tocilizumab.
32441462,The global response to finding therapeutics for COVID-19 is chaotic even if well intentioned.
32441462,There is an opportunity, but more importantly, an obligation for the global clinical and quantitative pharmacology community to come together and use our state-of-the-art tools and expertise to help society accelerate therapeutics to fight COVID-19.
32441764,Clinically approved PARP inhibitors (PARPi) have a mild adverse effect profile and are well-tolerated as continuous daily oral therapy.
32441764,PARPi's may potentiate the effectiveness of Tocilizumab, Anakinra, Sarilumab, Adalimumab, Canakinumab or Siltuximab therapy.
32441764,In summary, the evidence suggests that PARPi therapy would benefit COVID-19 patients and trials of these drugs should be undertaken.
32441771,Several trials are currently underway evaluating the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine as a potential treatment for acute infection.
32441771,Next, we identified medications that were flagged by MedSafer as being potentially inappropriate and crafted guidance around medication management if contemplating the use of hydroxychloroquine.
32441771,The COVID-19 pandemic highlights the importance of medication optimization and deprescribing PIMs in older adults.
32441771,By acting now to reduce polypharmacy and use of PIMs, we can better prepare this vulnerable population for inclusion in trials and, if substantiated, pharmacologic treatment or prevention of COVID-19.
32441773,Previous reports suggest the possibility of a protective factor from standard antiretroviral treatment for HIV patients that could have significant clinical benefits for these patients when co-infected with SARS-CoV-2.
32441783,Severe pneumonia which shares several of the features of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the main cause of morbidity and mortality in Coronavirus disease 19 (Covid-19) for which as of now there is no effective treatment.
32441786,In our retrospective non-randomised study, 34 patients under 50 years old and diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were included, according to given methylprednisolone treatment (n = 18) or not (n = 16), they were separated into 2 groups.
32441786,By comparing the clinical data we concluded that corticosteroids therapy can effectively release COVID-19 symptoms such as persistent fever and difficult breathing, improve oxygenation and prevent disease progression.
32441787,Here, a patient with immune thrombocytopenic purpura in Huoshenshan Hospital (Wuhan, China) was reported, whose laboratory data, clinical treatment and hospital outcome was described in this study.
32441788,Many critically ill patients with COVID-19 need specialty level palliative care to manage symptoms, conduct goals of care conversations, and facilitate medical decision making in ethically and emotionally charged situations.
32441788,During the apex of the COVID-19 crisis in New York, the Adult Palliative Care Service at Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC)/NewYork-Presbyterian (NYP) received a 7-fold increase in consultation requests.
32441788,This unprecedented increase in demand outpaced the palliative care team's ability to respond.
32441788,We describe the rapid development and implementation of a scalable virtual consultation model staffed by out-of-state palliative care specialist volunteers.
32441805,Today, it is a pandemic infection, and even if several compounds are used as curative or supportive treatment, there is not a definitive treatment.
32441805,In particular, antiviral treatment used for the treatment of several viral infections (eg, hepatitis C, HIV, Ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus) are today used with a mild or moderate effect on the lung injury.
32441805,Therefore, an add-on therapy with drugs able to reduce inflammation, edema, and cell activation has been proposed as well as a treatment with interferon, corticosteroids or monoclonal antibodies (eg, tocilizumab).
32441805,In this article reviewing literature data related to the use of escin, an agent having potent anti-inflammatory and anti-viral effects in lung injury, we suggest that it could represent a therapeutic opportunity as add-on therapy in ALI related to COVID-19 infection.
32442035,Two systematic reviews suggest a large reduction in mortality with NIV compared with conventional oxygen therapy.
32442105,Treatment of cells with auranofin resulted in a 95% reduction in the viral RNA at 48 h after infection.
32442105,Auranofin treatment dramatically reduced the expression of SARS-COV-2-induced cytokines in human cells.
32442210,There is currently no specific treatment for COVID-19, but antiviral therapy combined with supportive care is the main strategy.
32442210,Here, we summarize recent progress in understanding the epidemiological, virological, and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 and discuss potential targets with existing drugs for the treatment of this emerging zoonotic disease.
32442265,Studies of the impact of treatment on asymptomatic RT-PCR+ individuals on disease progression and transmission should be undertaken.
32442285,No significant differences were observed between RAAS inhibitor users and nonusers in terms of vasopressor use, modes of ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, renal replacement therapy, and acute cardiac events.
32442287,Thymosin alpha 1 (Tα1) had been used in the treatment of viral infections as an immune response modifier for many years.
32442287,Compared with untreated group, Tα1 treatment significantly reduces mortality of severe COVID-19 patients (11.11% vs.
32442315,ACE2 is a potential target for many treatment approaches for the SARS-CoV-2.
32442317,Paradoxically, treatment with anti-inflammatory agents and immune regulators has been associated with worsening of ARDS.
32442347,Where mechanical ventilation may not be enough, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) could play a role as a form of rescue therapy and may provide beneficial results in the hands of skilled clinicians in centers with experience of using ECMO appropriately in selected patients.
32442437,Thereafter, two other proteasome inhibitors (carfilzomib and ixazomib), designed to overcome resistance to bortezomib, have been approved for treatment-experienced patients, and a variety of novel inhibitors are currently under preclinical and clinical investigation not only for haematological malignancies but also for solid tumours.
32442528,We prospectively identified adult patients (aged ≥18 years) admitted to both hospitals from March 2 to April 1, 2020, who were diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and were critically ill with acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure, and collected clinical, biomarker, and treatment data.
32442528,Secondary outcomes included frequency and duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, frequency of vasopressor use and renal replacement therapy, and time to in-hospital clinical deterioration following admission.
32442528,As of April 28, 2020, 101 (39%) patients had died and 94 (37%) remained hospitalised. 203 (79%) patients received invasive mechanical ventilation for a median of 18 days (IQR 9-28), 170 (66%) of 257 patients received vasopressors and 79 (31%) received renal replacement therapy.
32442699,While evidence suggests that hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) may decrease the viral load in patients with a COVID-19 infection, a number of case reports indicate adverse dermatologic effects of this potential treatment.
32442699,To conduct a systematic review of previously reported cases of psoriasis onset, exacerbation, or relapse after HCQ treatment.
32442699,A comprehensive EMBASE and MEDLINE search of original studies examining adverse effects of HCQ treatment related to psoriasis was conducted.
32442699,HCQ treatment may result in induction, exacerbation, or relapse of psoriasis.
32442699,Monitoring for adverse effects of HCQ treatment is necessary, and clinical trials are essential in characterizing the safety profile of HCQ use in patients with a COVID-19 infection.
32442720,At present, the efforts of various countries focus on the rapid diagnosis and isolation of patients, as well as to find a treatment that can combat the most serious impact of the disease.
32442720,Unfortunately, no drugs or vaccines have been approved for the treatment of human coronaviruses, but there is an urgent need for in-depth research on emerging human infectious coronaviruses.
32442720,Clarification transmission routes and pathogenic mechanisms, and identification of potential drug treatment targets will promote the development of effective prevention and treatment measures.
32442939,In terms of myocardial infarction, a drop from 40% to 60% of the reperfusion treatment could increase mortality by 3% to 5%.
32442941,Information about their safety and efficacy as antimalarials, antivirals, as well as in the long-term treatment of rheumatic diseases was collected.
32443020,A third survey collected current practice of PIBD treatment.
32443020,Eight PIBD children had COVID-19 globally, all with mild infection without needing hospitalization despite treatment with immunomodulators and/or biologics.
32443020,No cases have been reported in China and South Korea but biologic treatment has been delayed in 79 children, of whom 17 (22%) had exacerbation of their IBD.
32443020,Among the Porto group members, face-to-face appointments were often replaced by remote consultations but almost all did not change current IBD treatment.
32443163,The pharmacological and immunological properties of interferons, especially those of interferon beta, and the corresponding treatment strategies are described, and the results of studies with different interferons in coronavirus infections are analysed.
32443163,This regimen differs from those approved for treatment of multiple sclerosis and consists of interferon beta-1a administered as a 24 hour intravenous infusion at a daily dose of up to 90 µg for 3-5 consecutive days.
32443163,Since under this regimen transient severe side effects can occur, it is analysed which patients are suitable for this kind of treatment in general and if patients with severe coronavirus infections could also be treated accordingly.
32443202,The discharge of hospital wastes and wastewater, especially those without appropriate treatment would expose the public in danger of infection.
32443345,Prone position ventilation, vasoconstrictor, antibacteria, and antiviral therapy were given.
32443442,Here we evaluate clinical and imaging parameters for estimating the need of intensive care unit (ICU) treatment.
32443442,Machine learning modelling was performed to estimate the risk for ICU treatment.
32443442,The need for ICU treatment is independently associated with affected lung volume, radiological severity score, CRP, and IL-6.
32443911,Unfortunately, there is still not a single proven effective drug available, and therefore, current therapeutic guidelines recommend supportive care including oxygen administration and treatment with antibiotics.
32444382,Due to the urgent need of a therapeutic treatment for coronavirus (CoV) disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, a number of FDA-approved/repurposed drugs have been suggested as antiviral candidates at clinics, without sufficient information.
32444382,Despite the potential discrepancy of drug efficacies between animals and humans, these preclinical ferret data should be highly informative to future therapeutic treatment of COVID-19 patients.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic continues to spread worldwide, with rapidly increasing numbers of mortalities, placing increasing strain on health care systems.
32444382,Despite serious public health concerns, no effective vaccines or therapeutics have been approved by regulatory agencies.
32444382,While most of the drug treatments marginally reduced clinical symptoms, they did not reduce virus titers, with the exception of emtricitabine-tenofovir treatment, which led to diminished virus titers in nasal washes at 8 dpi.
32444393,Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiologic characteristics and treatment and outcomes data were analyzed.
32444415,Deidentified data, including gender, age, laboratory and radiological results, symptoms, signs, and medication history, were collected from 2326 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, including 21 cases in combination with rheumatic disease, in Tongji Hospital between 13 January and 15 March 2020.
32444460,Overall, 41% (8199/20 133) of patients were discharged alive, 26% (5165/20 133) died, and 34% (6769/20 133) continued to receive care at the reporting date. 17% (3001/18 183) required admission to high dependency or intensive care units; of these, 28% (826/3001) were discharged alive, 32% (958/3001) died, and 41% (1217/3001) continued to receive care at the reporting date.
32444482,Studies of non- COVID-19 severe respiratory viral infections provide indirect, very low-quality evidence that raises the possibility that convalescent plasma has minimal or no benefit in the treatment of COVID-19 and low-quality evidence that it does not cause serious adverse events.
32444493,To report clinical and laboratory characteristics, as well as treatment and clinical outcomes of patients admitted for neurologic diseases with and without COVID-19.
32444493,Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data were extracted from medical records and compared (FDR-corrected) to those of neurologic patients without COVID-19 admitted in the same period.
32444504,In this setting, with the serious threat imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic in the context of rapidly evolving knowledge with much unknown, it is important to weigh the risks and benefits of treatment strategies offered to older patients.
32444743,In making the right choices, we have at hand a future integrated dental team care model with time to concentrate on personalised prevention advice, as well as the provision of effective, highly skilled treatment.
32444797,Biobanks can be either integrated into healthcare, where preservation of the biological material is a fork in clinical routine diagnostics and medical treatment processes or they can also host prospective cohorts or material related to clinical trials.
32444866,Patient education for personal hygiene and social distancing measures, along with treatment individualization, telemedicine and continuous surveillance for early diagnosis of COVID-19 are essential.
32444866,In countries or local communities where COVID-19 infection is widely spread, MM patients should have a PCR test of nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 before hospital admission, starting a new treatment line, cell apheresis or ASCT in order to avoid ward or community spread and infections.
32444866,Treatment initiation should not be postponed for patients with end organ damage, myeloma emergencies and aggressive relapses.
32444866,Patients with MM and symptomatic COVID-19 disease should interrupt anti-myeloma treatment until recovery.
32444866,For patients with positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2, but with no symptoms for COVID-19, a 14-day quarantine should be considered if myeloma-related events allow the delay of treatment.
32445083,Cancer wards have been subjected to several modifications to protect patients and healthcare professionals from COVID-19 infection, while attempting to maintain cancer diagnosis, therapy, and research.
32445105,The innovative and pragmatic tiered study approach has allowed for rapid recruitment and activation of numerous sites across the world-an approach essential to capture real-time critical neurological data to inform treatment strategies in this pandemic crisis.
32445195,Evidence- and experience-based treatment options such as multidisciplinary team care, feeding tubes, wheelchairs, home health and hospice have become more difficult to obtain and in some places are unavailable.
32445204,The Child Neurology Society collaborated with the Pediatric Epilepsy Research Consortium to issue an online statement April 6, 2020 of immediate recommendations to streamline diagnosis, treatment, and follow up of infantile spasms.
32445204,The recommendations encourage use of telemedicine, outpatient over inpatient studies, and oral therapies as initial treatment.
32445315,The panel recommends deferring treatment of patients with renal cell carcinoma by 3 to 6 months, except for those with ongoing hematuria and/or inferior vena cava thrombus, which warrant immediate surgery.
32445315,Metastatic renal cell cancers should be started on targeted therapy.
32445315,Management of low and intermediate risk prostate cancer can be deferred for 3 to 6months while high risk prostate cancer patients can be initiated on neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy.
32445315,Neoadjuvant chemotherapy should be avoided and adjuvant therapy should be deferred.
32445315,We need to tailor our treatment strategies to the prevailing present conditions, so as to fight and defeat both, the SARS-CoV-2 virus and cancer.
32445330,Appropriate triage and customization of treatment protocols can help curtail hospital visits and time-spent by cancer patients during pandemic times, thereby reducing their risk of exposure as well as allowing efficient utilization of resources.
32445440,Although several therapeutic agents have been evaluated for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), none have yet been shown to be efficacious.
32445484,The opportunities for clinical pharmacology to contribute to the development of new treatments have already been described by others in Clinical Pharmacology &amp; Therapeutics (2).
32445580,Viral load of SARS-CoV-2 peaked within the first few days (2-4 days) after admission, then decreased rapidly along with virus rebound under treatment.
32445580,The serial viral loads of patients revealed whole viral shedding during hospitalization and the resurgence of virus during the treatment, which could be used for early warning of illness severity, thus improve antiviral interventions.
32445881,The duration of viral RNA of respiratory tract in the monotherapy group was not longer than that in the combined therapy group.
32445881,We inferred that Arbidol/IFN - 2b therapy can be used as an effective method to improve the COVID-19 pneumonia of mild patients, although it helpless with accelerating the virus clearance.
32445904,Preventative and non-pharmacologic interventions remain critical for managing delirium in such patients, though occasionally pharmacologic treatment is required.
32445904,When use of an antipsychotic medication is indicated, we recommend that providers consider foregoing the lowest common dose and instead start with the next incrementally higher dose to more quickly and reliably ensure the safety of both patients and providers.
32445904,We do not recommend initiating prophylactic treatment or escalating doses in a manner that conflicts with currently accepted guidelines without carefully considering the risks and benefits.
32445935,Patients should be informed to safely proceed with their treatment and follow the rules for self-protection to COVID-19.
32445956,This study may provide meaningful and useful information on further research to investigate the action mechanisms of Chinese medicines against SARS-CoV-2 and also provide a basis for sharing the &quot;China scheme&quot; for COVID-19 treatment.
32446037,Early diagnosis is crucial for correct treatment in order to possibly reduce the stress in the healthcare system.
32446167,We retrospectively summarized the characteristics, treatment and outcomes of pediatric cases in Wuhan Children's Hospital which was the only designated hospital for children with COVID-19 in Hubei Province.
32446167,The efficacy of the antiviral therapy in children with COVID-19 remains to be evaluated.
32446311,Efficacy of conventional treatment plus the complementary therapy Liu-zi-jue (a mind-body exercise) to treat patients with mild COVID-19.
32446312,Metformin was proposed to be a candidate for host-directed therapy for COVID-19.
32446312,Antidiabetic treatment with metformin was associated with decreased mortality compared with diabetics not receiving metformin.
32446795,The clinical features, treatment strategies and prognosis data were collected and analyzed.
32446795,COVID-19 patients with diabetes were more likely to develop severe or critical disease conditions with more complications, and had higher incidence rates of antibiotic therapy, non-invasive and invasive mechanical ventilation, and death (11.1% vs.
32446801,We will also highlight the recent treatment strategies being explored to control this pandemic.
32446813,Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is capable of performing syndrome differentiation and treatment according to the clinical manifestations of patients, and has a better ability of epidemic prevention and control.
32446813,The authors comprehensively analyzed the etiology and pathogenesis of COVID-19 based on the theory of TCM, and discussed its syndrome differentiation, treatment and prevention measures so as to provide strategies and reference for the prevention and treatment with TCM.
32446978,This prospective cohort study of the correlates of the risk of death in COVID-19 patients was conducted at the Infectious Diseases and Intensive Care units of Luigi Sacco Hospital, Milan, Italy.
32447059,This included scheduled outpatient cardiac surgical and interventional procedures that required the use of intensive care units, ventilators, and skilled critical care personnel, given that these procedures would draw from the same pool of resources required for critically ill COVID-19 patients.
32447101,The prevalence of diabetes patients hospitalized in intensive care units for COVID-19 is two- to threefold higher, and the mortality rate at least double, than that of non-diabetes patients.
32447102,Yet, in spite of this therapy, patients with vs. patients without diabetes have an adverse disease course.
32447292,The recent joint statement from the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (ASRA) and the European Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Therapy (ESRA) recommends neuraxial and peripheral nerve blocks for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) illness.
32447429,The purpose of this review is to quantify the landscape of current clinical trials ongoing for therapies in the treatment of COVID-19.
32447429,There were 341 interventional studies and 208 different therapies actively registered on clinicaltrials.gov whose primary aim is the treatment of COVID-19.
32447603,•The most frequently discussed topics in videos were the place of hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19 and whether to continue the use of existing rheumatological drugs.
32447777,However, the intent to prevent the spread of this lethal respiratory disease will likely lead to reduced treatment access due to restrictions on population movements.
32447777,The methods presented include committee-based prioritization of dental patients, a multilayered screening process, team rotations with social and temporal spacing, and modified treatment room protocols.
32447820,With no definite treatment, as of now, encouraging reports of some anti-viral and anti-malarial drugs in the management of COVID-19 generate some hope.
32447846,In order to better fight against the epidemic and give full play to the advantages of traditional Chinese medicine, we explored the feasibility of acupuncture therapy in the intervention of COVID-19 through analyzing the relevant literature in both ancient and modern time.
32447846,It was proposed that the advantages of acupuncture and moxibustion should be fully displayed while Chinese herbal medications have been applied in the treatment of COVID-19.
32447846,During treatment, acupuncture physicians should be rationally allocated to a certain proportion so as to adequately utilize comprehensive therapeutic approaches and guarantee people's safety to the greatest extent.
32447934,The timing and protocol of anticoagulation therapy are still under investigation based on more clinical data. <b>目的：</b> 总结合并肢端缺血的新型冠状病毒肺炎（COVID-19）患者的临床和凝血功能特征。
32448039,Currently there are no approved drugs for the treatment of coronaviral disease (COVID-19), although some of the drugs have been tried.
32448039,Chloroquine is being widely used in treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32448333,Questions about institutional rules and personal approach for patient treatment and to limit epidemic spread were included in a 37-item questionnaire.
32448333,Up to 40% of non-traumatic abdominal emergency cases had an unusual delayed treatment.
32448345,The primary endpoint is time to clinical improvement (censored at day 28), defined as the time (in days) from randomization of study treatment (remdesivir or placebo) until a decline of two categories on a six-category ordinal scale of clinical status (1 = discharged; 6 = death) or live discharge from hospital.
32448377,Although scientific advancements have allowed for rapid progress to be made to understand the pathogenesis and develop therapeutics after each viral pandemic, few effective methods to treat virus-induced ALI have been described.
32448377,Recently, stem cell therapy has been widely used in the treatment of various diseases, including ALI.
32448377,In this review, we detail the present stem cell-based therapeutics for lung injury caused by influenza virus and the outlook for the future state of stem cell therapy to deal with emerging influenza and coronaviruses.
32448490,There has been no specific treatment against 2019-nCoV up to now, and physicians only apply supportive therapy.
32448490,We hope that this review has a positive impact on public knowledge for helping to deal with the 2019-nCoV and move one step forward toward its treatment in the near future.
32448818,To examine the effects of protease inhibitors on the replication of coronavirus 229E, we pretreated primary cultures of human nasal epithelial (HNE) cells with camostat or nafamostat, each of which has been used for the treatment of pancreatitis and/or disseminated intravascular coagulation.
32448818,Pretreatment with camostat (0.1-10 μg/mL) or nafamostat (0.01-1 μg/mL) reduced the titers of coronavirus 229E.
32449022,Considering its potential benefits and high availability, acetic acid disinfection appears to be a promising adjunctive therapy in cases of non-severe COVID-19 and deserves further investigation.
32449057,His condition worsened and he died after more than 2 weeks of hospitalization and aggressive treatment.
32449128,We described Covid-19 cumulative incidence, treatment outcome, mortality, and associated risk factors.
32449128,Patients who combined hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin presented 3/18 deaths, regardless of age, staging, histology, cancer treatment and comorbidities (OR 0.02, p = 0.03).
32449128,Combined hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin is presented as a good treatment option.
32449169,Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of convalescent plasma as a possible treatment has been explored.
32449169,Within weeks, we were able to distribute over 8000 products, scale up collections to over 4,000 units per week, meet hospital demand, as well as support randomized controlled trials to evaluate the efficacy of convalescent plasma treatment.
32449224,The clinical characteristics, laboratory tests, treatment features and prognoses were summarized.
32449224,Throughout a patient's hospitalization, their treatment plan should be evaluated and adjusted according to their vital signs, clinical symptoms, laboratory tests and imaging changes.
32449235,Although immunosuppressed patients may be more prone to SARS-CoV-2 infection with atypical presentation, long-term immunosuppression therapy may provide some sort of protection for severe clinical complications of COVID-19.
32449235,The interaction between immunosuppression and new antiviral drugs in the treatment of transplanted patients contracting COVID-19 has not yet been fully investigated.
32449333,Confronted with thousands of deaths daily worldwide, we have to build quickly the rationale behind the treatment, taking advantage from past analogues.
32449523,In response to this shift, Waller and colleagues compiled a series of expert recommendations to help clinicians pivot to delivering teletherapy to address eating disorders during COVID-19.
32449528,Motor and nonmotor symptoms significantly worsened in the COVID-19 group, requiring therapy adjustment in one-third of cases.
32449528,Clinical deterioration was explained by both infection-related mechanisms and impaired pharmacokinetics of dopaminergic therapy.
32449757,Caring for older patients with breast cancer presents unique clinical considerations due to preexisting and competing comorbidity, the potential for treatment-related toxicity, and the consequent impact on functional status.
32449757,In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, treatment decision-making for older patients is especially challenging and encourages us to re-focus our treatment priorities.
32449757,While we work to avoid treatment delays and maintain therapeutic benefit, we also need to minimize the risk for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) exposures, myelosuppression, general chemotherapy toxicity, and functional decline.
32449757,Herein, we propose multidisciplinary care considerations for the aging patient with breast cancer, with the goal to promote a team-based, multidisciplinary treatment approach during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.
32449792,In this brief report we describe, our first single-centre experience from a 58-year-old Caucasian male patient with HIV who developed a severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, including clinical characteristics, treatment, and outcomes.
32449972,We also described electrocardiogram findings, complications, and treatment during hospitalization in detail.
32449999,To evaluate the impact of the coronavirus pandemic and the quarantine in orthodontic appointments, and patients' anxiety and concerns about their ongoing orthodontic treatment.
32449999,Settings and sample population Patients from private dental clinics of two orthodontists that were undergoing active orthodontic treatment.
32449999,The greatest concern of patients was delay in the end of treatment.
32449999,Delay in treatment was the greatest concern of patients undergoing orthodontic treatment.
32450087,To-date, there has not been a clear signal suggesting that asthma or treatment with inhaled steroids are a risk factor for severe COVID-19 disease.
32450087,These data suggest that differences in ACE2, TMPRSS2 and furin epithelial and airway gene expression are unlikely to confer enhanced COVID-19 pneumonia risk in patients with asthma across all treatment intensities and severity.
32450107,Hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, often in combination with a second-generation macrolide, are being widely used for treatment of COVID-19, despite no conclusive evidence of their benefit.
32450107,Although generally safe when used for approved indications such as autoimmune disease or malaria, the safety and benefit of these treatment regimens are poorly evaluated in COVID-19.
32450107,We did a multinational registry analysis of the use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine with or without a macrolide for treatment of COVID-19.
32450107,Patients who received one of the treatments of interest within 48 h of diagnosis were included in one of four treatment groups (chloroquine alone, chloroquine with a macrolide, hydroxychloroquine alone, or hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide), and patients who received none of these treatments formed the control group.
32450107,Of these, 14 888 patients were in the treatment groups (1868 received chloroquine, 3783 received chloroquine with a macrolide, 3016 received hydroxychloroquine, and 6221 received hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide) and 81 144 patients were in the control group. 10 698 (11·1%) patients died in hospital.
32450107,Each of these drug regimens was associated with decreased in-hospital survival and an increased frequency of ventricular arrhythmias when used for treatment of COVID-19.
32450198,The chloroquine (CQ) and its analogue hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have been used as frontline drugs for treatment and prophylaxis against all types of human malaria worldwide.
32450198,Considering the global health crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic, the option of using the drugs and repurposing of old drugs in this instance, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, specifically, hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 could be the best choice.
32450198,Given that there is no cure for COVID-19, the clinical testing of HCQ is urgently needed to ascertain its potency against the virus as this is the current available treatment option.
32450344,Our objective was to explore the effects of the administration of anti-platelet therapy on arterial oxygenation and clinical outcomes in patients with severe Covid-19 with hypercoagulability.
32450344,Treated patients consistently experienced a mean (SD) reduction in A-a O2 gradient of -32.6 mmHg (61.9, P = 0.154), -52.4 mmHg (59.4, P = 0.016) and -151.1 mmHg (56.6, P = 0.011; P = 0.047 vs. controls) at 24, 48 hours and 7 days after treatment.
32450344,Antiplatelet therapy might be effective in improving the ventilation/perfusion ratio in Covid-19 patients with severe respiratory failure.
32450346,Understanding the dynamic progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucial to determine an effective treatment strategy to reduce the rising mortality of this global pandemic.
32450718,In this dramatic scenario, all the resources are addressed to the intensive care units for the assessment of the emergency.
32450756,The COVID-19 pandemic has placed a significant personnel burden on intensive care units across the globe.
32450761,During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, patients in intensive care units who are undergoing long-term intubation may require tracheostomy.
32450787,In the context of COVID-19, clinicians will have to determine whether liver injury is related to an underlying liver disease, drugs used for the treatment of COVID-19, direct effect of the virus, or a complicated disease course.
32450906,The sex and gender disparities observed in COVID-19 vulnerability emphasize the need to better understand the impact of sex and gender on incidence and case fatality of the disease and to tailor treatment according to sex and gender.
32450906,The ongoing and planned prophylactic and therapeutic treatment studies must include prospective sex- and gender-sensitive analyses.
32451259,Many emerging evidences have converged on the effectiveness of HQ in the treatment of Covid-19 infection.
32451271,Before an effective vaccine or medicine is available, supportive therapy and identifying patients who are at high risk of cardiac complications are important.
32451343,The current advice available to doctors appears to be inconsistent, with some suggesting withdrawal of treatment is more serious than withholding, while others suggest that this distinction should not be made.
32451343,We argue that there is no ethically relevant difference between withdrawing and withholding treatment and that suggesting otherwise may have problematic consequences.
32451343,If doctors are discouraged from withdrawing treatment, concern about a future shortage may make them reluctant to provide ventilation to patients who are unlikely to have a successful outcome.
32451351,However, we highlight several considerations regarding treatment with high dose HCQ.
32451354,Carlos Antonio Moura and Ana Luísa Cerqueira de Sant'Ana Costa emphasizes the need to understand mechanisms of disease underlying the more serious complications of Covid-19 infection as well as provide the best treatment possible to large numbers of seriously ill patients during a global pandemic (2).
32451655,In addition, 12 patients needing hospitalization for planning a non-deferrable elective surgical treatment were included.
32451736,Quaternary ammonium compounds such as ammonium chloride, cetylpyridinium and miramistin represent widely accessible antiseptic molecules with well-known broad-spectrum antiviral activities and represent a repurposing opportunity as therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2.
32452539,Since the causative agent, SARS-CoV-2, is a recently discovered species, there is no specific medicine for downright treatment of the infection.
32452539,Herein, the COVID-19 structure, epidemiology, pathogenesis, etiology, diagnosis, and therapy have been reviewed.
32452700,The Canadian Society of Breast Imaging/Canadian Association of Radiologists guideline for breast imaging during COVID-19 is provided based on priority according to risk of breast cancer and impact of delaying treatment.
32452746,In all 3 cases, the procedure was delayed, and patients were admitted for treatment or discharged under home quarantine.
32452746,During this period, 86% of operative procedures were indicated for treatment of oncologic disease.
32452838,It is challenging for this population to access public information regarding COVID-19 testing, treatment, and assistance programs because this information is seldom disseminated in Spanish and even less frequently in Portuguese.
32452888,Mortality was significantly associated with older age, lower body mass index, chronic renal disease, higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, lower PaO2/FIO2 ratio, higher D-dimer, higher C-reactive protein, and receipt of mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, renal replacement therapy, or vasodilator therapy.
32452905,The impact of this cessation of pain treatment may have unintended consequences of increased pain, reduced function, increased reliance on opioid medications and potential increased morbidity, due to the systemic impact of untreated disease burden.
32452947,VV ECMO can be utilized as an advanced therapy in select patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure refractory to traditional critical care management and optimal mechanical ventilation.
32452947,Anticipating a need for such therapies during the pandemic, our center created a targeted protocol for ECMO therapy in COVID-19 patients that allows us to provide this life-saving therapy to our sickest patients without overburdening already stretched resources or excessively exposing healthcare staff to infection risk.
32452947,The median duration of VV ECMO therapy for patients who have been decannulated is 12 days (4-18 days).
32452954,COVID-19 emergency shocked national health systems, subtracting resources from treatment of other diseases.
32452954,The commonest criteria to prioritize surgery were tumor biology (80%), time interval from neoadjuvant therapy (61%), risk of becoming unresectable (57%), and tumor-related symptoms (52%).
32452979,Despite inpatient treatment for COVID-19 and a perianal abscess, the patient acutely decompensated, with worsening fever, tachycardia, fluid-refractory hypotension, elevation of liver enzymes, and transformation of the rash into purpura extending from the face to the trunk, upper and lower extremities, including the palmar and plantar surfaces of the hands and feet.
32452979,Within hours of infliximab treatment, fever, tachycardia and hypotension resolved.
32452979,This case supports a role for blockade of TNF-α in the treatment of COVID-19 inflammatory cascade.
32453656,We recommend that general principles of lung cancer treatment continue to be followed in most cases where delays could result in rapid cancer progression.
32453656,In principle, however, treatment paradigms must continue to be individualized, with careful consideration of risks and benefits of continuing or altering lung cancer-directed therapy.
32453685,We describe 2 cases in coronavirus disease patients in France involving presumed thrombotic stroke that occurred during ongoing anticoagulation treatment for atrial fibrillation stroke prophylaxis; 1 patient had positive antiphospholipid antibodies.
32453687,Passive immunotherapy with plasma derived from convalescent patients recovering from SARS-CoV-2 infection can be a promising approach in the treatment of COVID-19 patients.
32453702,These findings encourage further investigations to elucidate the underlying pathophysiology of thromboembolic events in COVID-19 patients and may support the introduction of full dose anticoagulation with or without antiplatelet therapy.
32453702,Interventional clinical trials may be helpful in defining the appropriate drug(s), for this purpose, the algorithms of administration, and the optimal duration of therapy.
32454090,Longitudinal outcome data can then be combined with other epidemics and old-age health data, to discover the best biomarkers to predict (i) coping with infection &amp; inflammation and thus hospitalization or intensive care, (ii) long-term health challenges, e.g. deterioration of lung function after intensive care, and (iii) treatment &amp; vaccination response.
32454157,The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by 2019-nCov/SARS-CoV-2 has become a pandemic with an urgent need for understanding the mechanisms and identifying a treatment.
32454157,Considering the properties of both compounds in terms of anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-pyrogenic, anti-viral and ER stress modulation and computational approaches revealing andrographolide docks with the SARS-CoV2 binding site, we predict that this combination therapy may have potential utility against COVID-19.
32454184,The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 creates surges of infected patients requiring hospitalization and puts palliative care programs at risk of being overwhelmed by patients, families, and clinicians seeking help.
32454184,In response to this unprecedented need for palliative care, our program sought to create a collection of palliative care resources for non-palliative care clinicians.
32454184,A workgroup of interdisciplinary palliative care clinicians developed the Palliative Care Toolkit, consisting of a detailed chapter in a COVID-19 online resource, a mobile and desktop web application, one-page guides, pocket cards, and communication skills training videos.
32454184,We also created a nurse resource hotline staffed by palliative care nurse practitioners and virtual office hours staffed by a palliative care attending physician.
32454184,Since its development, the Toolkit has helped us disseminate best practices to non-palliative care clinicians delivering primary palliative care, allowing our team to focus on the highest-need consults, and increasing acceptance of palliative care across hospital settings.
32454186,As healthcare institutions mobilize resources to address the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, palliative care may potentially be underutilized.
32454186,It is important to assess the use of palliative care in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
32454186,An analysis of the utilization of palliative care in accordance with patient comorbidities and other characteristics was performed while considering clinical outcomes.
32454186,The overall mortality rate was 21.5% (n=52) and in 48% (n=25) of these patients, palliative care was not involved.
32454186,Among those classified as having severe COVID-19, only 40% (n=31) had palliative care involvement.
32454186,Patients who got palliative care consults were of older age, had higher rates of intubation, need for vasopressors, and death.
32454186,There was a low utilization rate of palliative care in patients with COVID-19.
32454186,Conscious utilization of palliative care is needed at the time of COVID-19.
32454187,Currently, numerous trials testing potential treatment and preventative options are undertaken all over the world.
32454187,We summarised all registered clinical trials examining treatment and prevention options for COVID-19.
32454187,Registered clinical trials examining treatment and/or prevention options for COVID-19 were included.
32454187,Interventional treatment studies were mostly randomised (n=150, 76%) and open-label (n=73, 37%) with a median number of planned inclusions of 90 (IQR 40-200).
32454253,Prioritization among oncologic cases represents a difficult task: clinicians have to balance a possible delay in cancer diagnosis or treatment against the risk for a potential COVID-19 exposure.
32454500,Ongoing advances in technology and science and progress in information technology support the development of integrated multi-organ support platforms for personalized treatment according to the changing needs of the patient.
32454500,In the absence of vaccines or direct therapy for COVID-19, extracorporeal therapies could represent an option to prevent organ failure and improve survival.
32454512,In addition, CB6 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in rhesus monkeys at both prophylactic and treatment settings.
32454888,At present, COVID-19 has no specific therapeutic drugs, and the main clinical treatment is symptomatic treatment and control of complications.
32454888,On March 5, 2020, the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China issued the <i>Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Novel Coronavirus</i> (<i>2019</i>-<i>nCoV</i>) <i>Infection</i> (<i>Trial Version 7</i>), which integrated traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) into the treatment of COVID-19.
32454888,The purpose of this study is to summarize recent studies on the clinic application, pharmacological action, chemical substances and mechanism of Qingwen Baidu Decoction (QBD) on the treatment of various diseases.
32454888,It has been used in the treatment of sepsis, epidemic hemorrhagic fever, epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis, infantile pneumonia, sepsis-related encephalopathy, epidemic encephalitis B and other diseases.
32454888,In addition, this study attempts to explore the possible mechanism of QBD in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.
32454888,Through the analysis of the chemical substances, pharmacological action and mechanism of QBD, this paper will provide a reference theoretical basis for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 by QBD.
32454982,Amid <b>COVID</b>-<b>19</b> Crisis, reporting adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and medical device incidents (MDIs) to Health Canada or health authorities in every country is crucial for monitoring medication safety and improving public health.
32454983,Coronavirus sparks fear of medication shortage.
32454984,Most of the drugs that are being tried for the treatment have not been evaluated in any randomized controlled trials.
32455090,We suggest that whenever a suspected COVID-19 patient is transferred to a specialized center, they should be isolated and re-checked before joining the new patient population for treatment of the unique condition.
32455168,We review three issues of importance for microallocation: (1) Prediction of benefit (or of medical futility) may be technically very challenging; (2) When resources are scarce, calibration is less important for microallocation than is ranking to prioritize patients, since capacity determines thresholds for resource utilization; (3) The concept of group fairness, which is not germane in shared decision-making, is of central importance in microallocation.
32455475,Little is known how cancer treatment engaging immune checkpoints affects the course of COVID-19.
32455515,<b>Objective:</b> To analyse the clinical history, laboratory tests and pathological data of a patient who suffered from novel coronavirus pneumonia(COVID-19) and provide reference for the clinical treatment of similar cases. <b>Methods:</b> Data of clinical manifestation, laboratory examination, bronchoscopy, echocardiography and cardiopulmonary pathological results were retrospectively reviewed in a case of COVID-19 with rapid exacerbation from mild to critical condition. <b>Results:</b> This patient hospitalized at day 9 post 2019 novel coronavirus(2019-nCoV) infection, experienced progressive deterioration from mild to severe at day 11, severe to critical at day 18 and underwent extracorporeal membrane oxygenation(ECMO) and continuous renal replacement therapy(CRRT) as well as heart lung transplantation during day 28-45 day post infection, and died on the second day post heart and lung transplantation.
32455534,Thus, there remains an urgent need for the identification and development of specific antiviral therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2.
32455629,Quercetin has been identified as one of top-scoring candidate therapeutics in the supercomputer SUMMIT drug-docking screen and Gene Set Enrichment Analyses (GSEA) of expression profiling experiments (EPEs), indicating that highly structurally similar quercetin, luteolin, and eriodictyol could serve as scaffolds for the development of efficient inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32455629,In line with the results of present analyses, a randomized interventional clinical trial evaluating effects of estradiol on severity of the coronavirus infection in COVID19+ and presumptive COVID19+ patients and two interventional randomized clinical trials evaluating effects of vitamin D on prevention and treatment of COVID-19 were listed on the ClinicalTrials.gov website.
32455894,In this manuscript, we address the unique issues regarding treatment prioritization for the patient with bladder cancer and how we at City of Hope have adjusted our clinical practices using a team-based approach that utilizes shared decision making with all stakeholders (physicians, patients, caregivers) to optimize outcomes during this difficult time.
32455894,In addition to taking standard precautions for minimizing COVID-19 risk of exposure for those entering a healthcare facility (screening all personnel upon entry and donning facemasks at all times), we suggest the following three measures: (1) delay post-treatment surveillance visits until there is a decrease in local COVID-19 cases, (2) continue curative intent treatments for localized bladder cancer with COVID-19 precautions (i.e., choosing gemcitabine/cisplatin (GC) over dose-dense methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, cisplatin (ddMVAC) neoadjuvant chemotherapy), and (3) increase the off-treatment period between cycles of palliative systemic therapy in metastatic urothelial carcinoma patients.
32455961,Severely affected patients are referred to intensive care units (ICUs), limiting their possibilities for physical exercise.
32455961,Whole body vibration (WBV) exercise is a non-invasive, physical therapy, that has been suggested as part of the procedures involved with pulmonary rehabilitation, even in ICU settings.
32456064,Patients with diabetes have been reported to have enhanced susceptibility to severe or fatal COVID-19 infections, including a high risk of being admitted to intensive care units with respiratory failure and septic complications.
32456123,This review aims to evaluate the effectiveness and adverse events of herbal medicines for the treatment of COVID-19.
32456123,Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs assessing the effects of herbal medicines for the treatment of COVID-19 were eligible.
32456123,All included trials compared the combined therapy of herbal medicine with Western medicine to Western medicine alone.
32456123,The combined therapy significantly improved the total effective rate (RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.34, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), cough symptom disappearance rate (RR 1.45, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.89, <i>p</i> = 0.005), and sputum production symptom disappearance rate (RR 1.73, 95% CI 1.19 to 2.50, <i>p</i> = 0.004).
32456123,Beneficial effects of the combined therapy were also seen in TCM syndrome score of cough (MD -1.18, 95% CI -1.34 to -1.03, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), fever (MD -0.62, 95% CI -0.79 to -0.45, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), dry and sore throat (MD -0.83, 95% CI -1.45 to -0.20, <i>p</i> = 0.009), and fatigue (MD -0.60, 95% CI -1.04 to -0.17, <i>p</i> = 0.007).
32456123,Significant effects of the combined therapy of herbal medicine with Western medicine were found, and revealed the potential role of herbal medicine in treating COVID-19.
32456123,More high-quality RCTs are needed to further validate the effectiveness and adverse events of herbal medicine in the treatment of COVID-19.
32456286,Our study suggested that HCQ and rfIFN-ω are applicable for treatment of FIP.
32456286,Further clinical studies are needed to verify the combination of HCQ and rIFN-ω will be effective and safe treatment for cats with FIP.
32456368,Therefore, understanding the differences and similarities of ARDS induced by COVID-19 and other diseases currently are the basis for clinicians to make decisions for the treatment of COVID-19 induced ARDS.
32456948,Medical records including demographic data, medical history, clinical characteristics, laboratory examinations, chest computed tomography (CT), and treatment measures were collected, analyzed, and compared between the two groups.
32457036,Since the availability of resources for diagnostic procedures, surgery and postoperative care, systemic therapy and radiotherapy may differ, authors did separate prioritisation analyses.
32457038,However, newly evolving viral mutations, the prospect of only temporary immunity, and a long path to regulatory approval pose significant challenges and call for a common, readily available and inexpensive treatment.
32457086,For patient safety, it will be critical to follow the WHO guidance regarding: a standard operating procedure; clinical protocols for when video consultations can (and cannot) be used; policies to ensure equity of access in disadvantaged populations; adequate staff training; and administrative support to coordinate appointments.
32457133,The existing strain on dialysis capacity will be exacerbated as patients remain on dialysis as the only available form of renal replacement therapy.
32457227,Evaluation of cause, clinical symptoms, and treatment response.
32457227,The patient showed no response to steroid therapy and died on the eighth day of admission.
32457932,CQ may also cause seizures, often refractory to standard treatment.
32457932,The treatment of CQ/HCQ poisoning includes high-dose intravenous diazepam postulated to have positive ionotropic and antidysrhythmic properties that may antagonize the cardiotoxic effects of CQ.
32457932,Current scientific evidence does not support treatment or prophylactic use of these agents for COVID-19 disease.
32458019,Further research is needed to corroborate this assumption and identify those patients who may benefit from this treatment pathway.
32458021,Acute kidney injury (AKI) requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT) is common in critically ill patients with COVID-19.
32458121,In a recent issue published in the European Archives of Otorhinolaryngology, Mattioli et al. published a short communication about tracheostomy timing in patients with COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019); they reported that the tracheostomy could allow early Intensive Care Units discharge and, in the context of prolonged Invasive Mechanical Ventilation, should be suggested within 7 and 14 days to avoid potential tracheal damages.
32458149,The current COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has prompted investigators worldwide to search for an effective anti-viral treatment.
32458149,A number of anti-viral drugs such as ribavirin, remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, antibiotics such as azithromycin and doxycycline, and anti-parasite such as ivermectin have been recommended for COVID-19 treatment.
32458149,In addition, sufficient pre-clinical rationale and evidence have been presented to use chloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19.
32458149,Besides, Zn supplement can favour COVID-19 treatment using those suggested and/or recommended drugs.
32458149,Given those benefits, this perspective paper describes how and why Zn could be given due consideration as a complement to the prescribed treatment of COVID-19.
32458206,Recent publications on SARS-CoV-2 have brought attention to the possible benefit of chloroquine in the treatment of patients infected by SARS-CoV-2.
32458206,An effective prophylactic medication to prevent viral entry has to contain, at least, either a protease inhibitor or a competitive virus ACE2-binding inhibitor.
32458206,We propose the use of bromhexine as a prophylactic and treatment.
32458206,We encourage the scientific community to assess bromhexine clinically as a prophylactic and curative treatment.
32458279,We suggest that a combination of an IV and pulmonary delivery dose regimen should be studied immediately to realize a potentially more effective antiviral therapy against COVID-19.
32458356,The early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic have focused on containing SARS-CoV-2 infection and identifying treatment strategies.
32458356,Many countries have made changes to routine management of NCD patients, e.g., cancelling non-urgent outpatient visits, which will have important implications for NCD management, diagnosis of new-onset NCDs, medication adherence, and NCD progression.
32458370,This article discusses a stepwise algorithm for the management of outpatient warfarin therapy.
32458370,Alternative management strategies are presented and discussed, including alternative pharmacological therapy options and self-monitoring.
32458370,Our algorithm aims to help clinicians safely optimize the treatment of patients requiring anticoagulation therapy in the context of the global response to the current pandemic.
32458488,The Colombian government has approved the use of CQ for COVID-19, a measure that could negatively impact a large number of patients who depend on this drug for the treatment of other life-threatening diseases such as malaria and rheumatic autoimmune diseases.
32458502,These prescriptions are however neither specific nor highly effective for COVID-19 treatment.
32458502,This patient went through severe COVID-19 but eventually recovered upon the implementation of this treatment regimen, suggesting potential therapeutic effects of diammonium glycyrrhizinate as alternative medicine to help relieve COVID-19 symptoms.
32458530,Patients, who will be started on immunosuppressive therapy, should be tested for Covid-19 prior to the therapy, and in the event that Covid-19 is suspected, the therapy should be discontinued.
32458536,Psoriasis and atopic dermatitis are common, chronic, inflammatory skin conditions, with immune dysregulation as a shared mechanism; therefore, mainstays of treatment include systemic immunomodulating therapies.
32458536,Without definitive COVID-19 data, these recommendations may be useful in guiding treatment of psoriasis and atopic dermatitis patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.
32458588,During remote-visits several interventions were conducted: triage for COVID-19 suspected symptoms, email check of clinical pictures and of laboratory examinations, advices for topical and systemic therapy continuation or discontinuation/switch and re-schedule of next appointment.
32458588,Our real-life experience shows that remote monitoring was effective in preventing unnecessary worsening of severe chronic skin diseases and poor outcomes due to withdrawal of current therapy.
32458596,Medical care decision should be balanced between controlling COVID-19 pandemic spread and timely diagnosis and treatment for gynecologic oncology patients.
32458597,COVID-19 threatens to curtail patient access to evidence-based treatment.
32458599,In addition to the treatment of patients with COVID-19, the China Medical Treatment Expert Group for COVID-19 is active to study and screen effective antiviral drugs, and has found that chloroquine, an old antimalarial,shows activity against SARS-CoV-2.
32458599,Then, chloroquine was included in the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 in China (version 6) issued by National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
32458599,This paper summarizes the currently available data and experiences from clinical treatment for malaria with chloroquine drugs, so as to provide insights into the more rational use of chloroquine agents for the treatment of COVID-19. <b>［摘要］</b> 2019 年底, 我国湖北省武汉市出现了新型冠状病毒肺炎 疫情, 随后在全国扩散并成为全球大流行。
32458694,Compared with non-ACEI/ARB treatment, ACEI/ARB treatment was not associated with disease severity (OR 0.71, 95 % CI 0.46-1.08, P 0.11, I<sup>2</sup> 59%) but was related to lower mortality of COVID-19 in patients with hypertension (OR 0.57, 95 % CI 0.38-0.84, P 0.004, I<sup>2</sup> 0).
32458694,In summary, ACEI/ARB therapy did not aggravate disease severity of COVID-19.
32458694,Besides, ACEI/ARB therapy can decrease the mortality of COVID-19.
32458969,High-risk patients presenting with progressing symptomatic disease have only hospitalization treatment with its high mortality.
32458969,An outpatient treatment that prevents hospitalization is desperately needed.
32458969,Five studies, including two controlled clinical trials, have demonstrated significant major outpatient treatment efficacy.
32459061,We report data regarding outpatient visits, multidisciplinary treatment planning conference, surgical caseload, and modifications of oncologic therapy during this pandemic and compared this data to the same interval last year.
32459123,Finally, we extend these findings to suggest possible treatment options that may merit investigation in randomized clinical trials.
32459144,It has been suggested that the main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 may be an important target to discover pharmaceutical compounds for the therapy of this life-threatening disease.
32459144,Therefore, the present research may provide some meaningful guidance for the prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
32459192,The global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has presented major challenges for clinical laboratories, from initial diagnosis to patient monitoring and treatment.
32459372,We review the current knowledge on the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 infection and RAS blockers and suggest a scientific rationale for continuing RAS blockers therapy in patients with COVID-19 infection.
32459529,To summarize evidence about the benefits and harms of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine for the treatment or prophylaxis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
32459529,Four randomized controlled trials, 10 cohort studies, and 9 case series assessed treatment effects of the medications, but no studies evaluated prophylaxis.
32459529,Two studies assessed the efficacy of chloroquine; 1 trial, which compared higher-dose (600 mg twice daily for 10 days) with lower-dose (450 mg twice daily on day 1 and once daily for 4 days) therapy, was stopped owing to concern that the higher dose therapy increased lethality and QTc interval prolongation.
32459567,The purpose of this review is to analyze what is currently known about COVID-19 in regard to the safety of systemic treatment, and to provide guidelines for use in psoriasis during this pandemic.
32459567,The AAD,NPF and IPC are in agreement regarding their recommendation that patients with active COVID-19 infection should discontinue any biologic therapy.
32459567,Patients with active COVID-19 infections should discontinue systemic treatment for psoriasis.
32459567,Patients with risk factors should discuss continuing treatment on a case by case basis.
32459571,Situations of not working or studying, not having had enough food in the past 12 months, not having a medical prescription to get medication and having had a workplace injury were all significantly associated with higher odds of having unmet healthcare needs.
32459574,In spite of the relatively high morbidity and mortality, there is no approved medication yet for COVID-19.
32459574,It is of paramount importance to explore some of the available tools that could help accelerate the adoption of any or some of the many proposed modalities for the treatment of diseases.
32459574,In addition to its usefulness when the results of new forms of treatment are quickly needed, other important benefit of sequential analysis includes the ability to reach a similar conclusion about the utility of a new drug without unduly exposing more patients to the side effect of the old drug, in particularly, for the treatment of a rare disease.
32459621,Both modified formulations met standard requirements for a 3-minute surgical hand preparation, the usual duration of surgical hand treatment in most hospitals in Europe.
32459655,Due to demographic change and, more recently, the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), the importance of modern intensive care units (ICU) is becoming apparent.
32459655,AI for ICUs would be useful for early detection of complications and increased risk of mortality, as well as to have guidelines for therapy and diagnostics proposed.
32459664,This has major implications for cancer prevention, management and treatment.
32459790,Epidemiologic data, previous clinical characteristics, support therapy needed, imaging tests, laboratory observations on admission, and pharmacologic therapy.
32459790,All patients needed oxygen therapy through a nasal cannula; five patients received high-flow nasal cannula therapy, which was later substituted with noninvasive ventilation in four.
32459790,Respiratory symptoms were the leading cause of PICU admission, making respiratory support the principal therapy.
32459919,In total, 397 patients underwent randomization and began treatment (200 patients for 5 days and 197 for 10 days).
32459919,The median duration of treatment was 5 days (interquartile range, 5 to 5) in the 5-day group and 9 days (interquartile range, 5 to 10) in the 10-day group.
32460184,Furthermore, timely access to mental healthcare, financial provisions and social/labour support programs, as well as optimal treatment for mental disorders is urgently needed.
32460208,Unfortunately, to date, there is no specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
32460364,We believe care givers as well as healthcare providers should not withhold necessary medical care since delay in diagnosis and treatment in these routinely seen medical emergencies may become as big of a threat as COVID-19 itself.
32460369,Although based on existing evidence, NSAIDs have been effective in treating respiratory infections caused by influenza and rhinovirus, since there is no clinical trial on COVID-19 and case-reports and clinical experiences are indicative of elongation of treatment duration and exacerbation of the clinical course of patients with COVID-19, it is recommended to use substitutes such as acetaminophen for controlling fever and inflammation and be cautious about using NSAIDs in management of COVID-19 patients until there are enough evidence.
32460390,Data on the clinical course of COVID-19 in immunosuppressed patients are limited and the effective treatment strategy for these patients is unknown.
32460390,Demographic, clinical and treatment data were extracted from the electronic patient files.
32460390,In 57% of patients, the immunosuppressive therapy was not changed and only 3 patients were treated with chloroquine.
32460390,Most patients recovered without experimental anti-viral therapy.
32460417,The clinical spectrum showed mostly mild symptoms with some patients developing bilateral pneumonia needing partly intensive care treatment and causing death(1).
32460421,NMSC is predominantly a cancer of the middle aged or elderly and accounts for considerable consulting and treatment time in most radiation oncology departments.
32460421,Many patients also suffer from medical co-morbidity, an important factor in any treatment decision.
32460457,In Korea, non-hospital facilities called &quot;living and treatment centers (LTCs)&quot; have been established since 5 March 2020.
32460458,We examined cytopathic effects of virus 48 hours after administration of the respective treatments and measured viral loads at three time points (0, 24, and 48 hours post-treatment) by quantitative real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, and compared the results obtained from the different antiviral regimens tested.
32460624,In addition to the standard of care, an immune-modulatory therapy tailored to each one of the different phenotypes should be used in order to prevent or reduce the release of cytokines responsible for organ damage and disease progression.
32460632,Antiviral therapy is employed for the burn patient with herpesvirus infections.
32460632,Recognition and antiviral therapy are employed, but additional studies are necessary to improve outcomes in these patients.
32460829,We report the characteristics and outcome of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 during breast cancer treatment at Institut Curie hospitals (ICH, Paris area, France).
32460829,We found no association between prior radiation therapy fields or extent of radiation therapy sequelae and extent of COVID-19 lung lesions.
32460829,This prospective registry analysis suggests that the COVID-19 mortality rate in breast cancer patients depends more on comorbidities than prior radiation therapy or current anti-cancer treatment.
32460839,Intravenous infusion of MSCs has shown promising results in COVID-19 treatment.
32460839,The pulmonary function and symptoms of the patient with COVID-19 pneumonia was significantly improved in 2 days after hWJC transplantation, and recovered and discharged in 7 days after treatment.
32460839,After treatment, the percentage and counts of lymphocyte subsets (CD3<sup>+</sup>, CD4<sup>+</sup>, and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell) were increased, and the level of IL-6, TNF-α, and C-reactive protein is significantly decreased after hWJC treatment.
32460839,Thus, the intravenous transplantation of hWJCs was safe and effective for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, especially for the patients in a critically severe condition.
32460839,This report highlights the potential of hWJC infusions as an effective treatment for COVID-19 pneumonia.
32460926,Issues around the assessment and treatment of these patients are examined and distilled into a simple (one-paged guidance resource that can assist clinicians in managing suspected delirium.
32461141,In this review we will discuss the relative role of the different complement activation products in the pathogenesis of COVID-19-associated tissue inflammation and thrombosis and propose the hypothesis that blockade of the terminal complement pathway may represent a potential therapeutic option for the prevention and treatment of lung and multi-organ damage.
32461198,The evaluation of the treatment of these comorbidities at baseline and during COVID-19 is scarce and the results are conflicting.
32461198,The aim of this review article was to summarize the prevalence of hypertension and CVD in patients with COVID-19, their influence on the outcome and the effect of treatment of hypertension and CVD in COVID-19 patients.
32461261,Both of these situations raise challenges for caregivers who are trying to be honest, to deal with their own moral distress, and to provide compassionate palliative care.
32461502,We still need an effective treatment, an affordable vaccine, or a collective achievement of sufficient immunity (reaching up to 70% of the whole population).
32461973,Currently, there is no vaccine or approved treatment for this emerging infection; thus, the objective of this study is to design a multiepitope peptide vaccine against COVID-19 using an immunoinformatics approach.
32461981,As of Feb. 9, 2020, a total of 40,260 patients have been diagnosed with NCP, and 23,589 patients were suspected to have infected by the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19), which puts forward a great challenge for public health and clinical treatment in China.
32462098,The weak governance in the fragile healthcare system exacerbates the general public's anxiety as the COVID-19 testing facilities are centered around in the urban areas, a long serial to be tested, minimum or no treatment facilities in the dedicated hospital units for COVID-19 patients are the chief observations hampered along with the disruption of other critical healthcare services.
32462267,As cardiovascular patients are at high risk but also have dyspnea and fatigue as leading symptoms, prevention, diagnostics and treatment in these patients are important to provide adequate care for those with or without COVID-19 but most importantly when comorbid cardiovascular conditions are present.
32462267,As angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is regarded as the viral receptor for cell entry and as the Coronavirus is downregulating this enzyme, which provides cardiovascular and pulmonary protection, there is ongoing discussions on whether treatment with cardiovascular drugs, which upregulate the viral receptor ACE2 should be modified.
32462267,As most of the COVID-19 patients have cardiovascular comorbidities like hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease and heart failure, which imposes a high risk on these patients, cardiovascular therapy should not be modified or even withdrawn.
32462289,Patients with diagnosis of cancer and undergoing treatment further represent a population at risk for worsening cardiopulmonary outcomes.
32462289,This review explores specific risk factors, diagnoses, and treatment options that impact cardio-oncologic patients with COVID-19.
32462289,Additionally, elderly cancer patients undergoing recent anti-cancer treatment may be at greater risk for sustaining worse outcomes, although data remains suboptimal in this population.
32462289,Major gaps remain regarding risk associated with type of cancer and type of anti-cancer treatment, as well as the layered risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer.
32462289,Immunomodulatory therapies used to treat cytokine release syndrome secondary to anti-cancer therapies, as well as other agents being traditionally used to treat cardiovascular and cancer disease states, are being investigated for treatment of COVID-19.
32462289,Patients undergoing anti-cancer therapy or those who have suffered from coronavirus infection may develop long-standing changes, not limited to pulmonary fibrosis, hyperlipidemia, and worsening atherosclerosis.
32462289,Those undergoing anti-cancer therapy are at theoretically increased susceptibility for infection, with type of cancer not necessarily dictating outcome.
32462289,A review of the literature of patients with cardiovascular and/or cancer disease is presented, as well as proposed strategies to attenuate risk regarding treatment, management, and surveillance in this vulnerable population.
32462412,Patients with clinical signs of seizures or otherwise unexplained encephalopathy may benefit from electroencephalography monitoring and/or empiric anti-epileptic therapy.
32462497,During the pandemic, the most important principles of treatment should be controlling the spread of infection as the first priority, prompt assessment of patient risk, recommending conservative medical therapy rather than invasive interventions, and strict infection control measures to limit infection spread within the hospital and to healthcare workers.
32462545,Further work is needed to prioritize drugs for investigation in well-controlled clinical trials and treatment protocols.
32462701,There is therefore an urgent need for development of animal models for improved evaluation of efficacy of drugs identified as having potential in the treatment of severe COVID-19.
32462717,In order to reduce the cytokine storm, we would like to propose the IL6 receptor antagonist therapy for the COVID-19 patients.
32462717,However, researchers and physicians should look for more IL6 receptor antagonists for the therapy of cytokine storm syndrome SARS-CoV-2 infected persons to enhance the therapeutic options for cytokine storm.
32462719,In the midst of a worldwide pandemic of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), a paucity of data precludes derivation of COVID-19-specific recommendations for nutritional therapy.
32462719,Delivery of nutritional therapy must include strategies to reduce exposure and spread of the disease by providing clustered care, adequate protection of healthcare providers, and preservation of personal protective equipment.
32462719,At all times, strategies for nutritional therapy need to be assessed on a risk/benefit basis, paying attention to risk for both the patient and the healthcare provider.
32462756,Cancer patients are advised to stay at home in case of potential infection, which may cause delays of routine diagnosis and necessary treatment.
32462841,Obesity represents a higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection, which may lead to the requirement of a mechanical ventilation in intensive care units and premature death.
32462858,The aim of the multicentre study promoted by Nuova FIO is to evaluate the beneficial effects of the systemic Oxygen-Ozone (O2O3) therapy in patients suffering from SARS COV-2 disease in the early phases of the disease, before worsening, up to the need of tracheal intubation.
32462858,The study is based on the rationale on that the systemic oxygen-ozone treatment could be effective, positively influencing the disease evolution and/or being able to mitigate the onset of the cytokine storm syndrome at least partially.
32462968,Prior research on nanotechnologies in diagnostics, prevention and treatment of coronavirus infections is reviewed.
32462968,The current absence of antiviral therapeutics that specifically target human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, might be largely due to the underuse of nanotechnologies.
32462968,Elucidating the interface between nanoparticles and coronaviruses is timely, but presents the only route to the rational design of precisely targeted therapeutics for coronavirus infections.
32462970,Two drugs Glisoxepide and Idarubicin used for treatment for diabetes and leukemia respectively were selected as stronger binder of EndoU.
32462984,In order not to compromise treatment of oncology patients, reducing the number of patients with COVID-19 undergoing treatment is mandatory.
32462988,The treatment for the severe respiratory illness caused by this virus is primarily symptomatic at this point, although the usage of a broad antiviral drug Remdesivir has been allowed on emergency basis by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
32463077,Requiring them to travel to an infusion center, stay in a skilled nursing facility or remain in the hospital longer than necessary to receive treatment results in avoidable risk of exposure amidst a pandemic.
32463204,Logistical patient data concerning patient numbers, chief complaints, length of stay in the Emergency Department, acuity level, isolation status, and treatment level were analysed.
32463221,The aim of this Viewpoint is to justify (1) the crucial roles of glutathione in determining individual responsiveness to COVID-19 infection and disease pathogenesis and (2) the feasibility of using glutathione as a means for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 illness.
32463221,The hypothesis unravels the mysteries of epidemiological data on the risk factors determining serious manifestations of COVID-19 infection and the high risk of death and opens real opportunities for effective treatment and prevention of the disease.
32463289,The COVID-19 pandemic has caused many Veterans Healthcare Administration providers working with veterans diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder to question the feasibility and appropriateness of continuing to provide trauma-focused treatment during this crisis.
32463289,Data from a Veterans Affairs medical center's posttraumatic stress disorder clinical team suggest that not only are veterans interested in continuing with treatment but also that the treatments can be modified to accommodate the current climate.
32463308,Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine were developed in the World War II era for treatment and prophylaxis of malaria, long before modern drug safety surveillance programs.
32463348,We evaluated baseline and post-medication QT interval (QTc, Bazett's) using 12-lead ECGs.
32463377,This paper examines the extent to which Australia, the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (US) during the two weeks following the pandemic announcement, sought to promote telehealth as a tool that could help identify COVID-19 among older people who may live alone, be frail and/or be self-isolating; and give support or facilitate the treatment of people who are or maybe infected.
32463478,The treatment of patients with cancer who test positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses unique challenges.
32463478,In this commentary, the authors describe the ethical rationale and implementation details for the creation of a novel, multidisciplinary treatment prioritization committee, including physicians, frontline staff, an ethicist, and an infectious disease expert.
32463478,The treatment prioritization committee sets a threshold of acceptable harm to patients from decreased cancer control that is justified to reduce risk to staff.
32463478,The creation of an ethical, consistent, and transparent decision-making process involving such frontline stakeholders is essential as departments across the country are faced with decisions regarding the treatment of SARS-CoV-2-positive patients with cancer.
32463545,A higher need for assisted ventilation beyond pure oxygen support (Invasive Mechanical Ventilation or Non-Invasive Ventilation) and a higher admission to intensive or semi-intensive care units was observed in patients with overweight and obesity (p&lt;0.01 and p &lt; 0.05, respectively) even after adjusting for sex, age and comorbidities (p&lt;0.05 and p&lt;0.001, respectively), or when patients with dementia or advanced cancer were removed from the analysis (p&lt;0.05).
32463545,Patients with overweight and obesity admitted in a medical ward for SARS-CoV-2 related pneumonia, despite their younger age, required more frequently assisted ventilation and access to intensive or semi-intensive care units than normal weight patients.
32463803,Off-label treatment with tocilizumab restored the cytotoxic potential of NK cells.
32464097,Without approved antiviral therapeutics or vaccines to this ongoing global threat, type I and type III interferons (IFNs) are currently being evaluated for their efficacy.
32464097,In this review, we describe the recent progress in our understanding of both type I and type III IFN-mediated innate antiviral responses against human coronaviruses and discuss the potential use of IFNs as a treatment strategy for COVID-19.
32464098,A better understanding of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 will be critical for the application and development of therapeutics.
32464098,In this review, we discuss what is known about the role of the innate immune system during SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggest directions for future studies, and evaluate proposed COVID-19 immunomodulating therapeutics.
32464333,To this aim, twelve influent sewage samples, collected between February and April 2020 from Wastewater Treatment Plants in Milan and Rome, were tested adapting, for concentration, the standard WHO procedure for Poliovirus surveillance.
32464584,In contrast to ablative haematopoietic stem cell therapy, most multiple-sclerosis-related disease modifying therapies do not particularly target the innate immune system and few have any major long-term impact on CD8 T cells to limit protection against COVID-19.
32464585,As the two previously reported cases of encephalitis associated with this virus were not widely discussed regarding the treatment, we share our successful approach and add some recommendations about this new and scarce entity.
32464624,This work reviews effective methods of using filtration devices in treatment to reduce the level of various inflammatory mediators and discharge patients from the ICU faster.
32464637,Therefore, different scientific discovery strategies need to be connected, to generate a rational treatment which can be made available as rapidly as possible.
32464637,The proposed mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 causes disease immediately suggests a possible treatment, since the AT1R is a key player in this whole process.
32464637,AT1R antagonists appear to be the ideal candidate for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
32464637,Therefore, we propose to consider using AT1R antagonists in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
32464662,The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has exacerbated staffing challenges already facing critical care nurses in intensive care units.
32464662,Many intensive care units have been understaffed and the majority of nurses working in these units have little experience.
32464670,For this purpose, an operational concept was developed, consisting of various individual actions, e. g. the reduction of outpatient treatment to emergencies, life-threatening diseases and urgent aftercare, a double triage of patients and the introduction of treatment teams.The newly developed operational concept was successfully implemented within a few days.
32464700,Most high-income countries are aggressively engaged in the collection and research evaluation of convalescent plasma as a specific passive immunotherapy for treatment of COVID-19.
32464700,Nevertheless, there is an urgent effort in LMIC to provide COVID-19 convalescent plasma as a potentially effective therapy that can be produced locally.
32466536,Liquid biopsy is considered a revolutionary technique that is opening unexpected perspectives in the early diagnosis and, in therapy monitoring, severe diseases, including cancer, metabolic syndrome, autoimmune, and neurodegenerative disorders.
32466736,We report our initial experience in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke with LVO in patients with COVID-19.
32466736,Baseline clinical and radiological findings, treatment, and short-term outcomes are reported.
32466738,To quantify the impact of the pandemic, the number of stroke code activations, ambulance transfers, consultations through telestroke, stroke unit admissions, and reperfusion therapy times and rates are described in temporal relationship with the rising number of COVID-19 cases in the region.
32466738,Time of arrival from symptoms onset to stroke units was delayed &gt;30 minutes, reperfusion therapy cases fell, and door-to-needle time started 16 minutes later than usual.
