&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&gt;
In this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan. […] Five family members (aged 36-66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3-6 days after exposure. […] Older patients (aged &amp;gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels.

&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&gt;
The outbreak of pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV in Wuhan, Hubei province of China, at the end of 2019 shaped tremendous challenges to China’s public health and clinical treatment. […] The virus belongs to the β genus Coronavirus in the family Corornaviridae, and is closely related to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, causing severe symptoms of pneumonia. […] After the outbreak of this disease, Chinese scientists invested a lot of energy to carry out research by developing rapid diagnostic reagents, identifying the characters of the pathogen, screening out clinical drugs that may inhibit the virus, and are rapidly developing vaccines.

&lt;b&gt;Objective:&lt;/b&gt; To analyze the clinical characteristics of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia and to investigate the correlation between serum inflammatory cytokines and severity of the disease. &lt;b&gt;Methods:&lt;/b&gt; 29 patients with 2019-ncov admitted to the isolation ward of Tongji hospital affiliated to Tongji medical college of Huazhong University of Science and Technology in January 2020 were selected as the study subjects. […] Clinical data were collected and the general information, clinical symptoms, blood test and CT imaging characteristics were analyzed. […] The expression levels of inflammatory cytokines and other markers in the serum of each group were detected, and the changes of these indicators of the three groups were compared and analyzed, as well as their relationship with the clinical classification of the disease. &lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; (1) The main symptoms of 2019-nCoV pneumonia was fever (28/29) with or without respiratory and other systemic symptoms. […] However, there were no statistically significant differences in serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), IL-1, IL-8, IL-10, hs-CRP, lymphocyte count and LDH among the three groups (P&amp;gt;0.05). &lt;b&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/b&gt; The clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia are similar to those of common viral pneumonia.

Since then, although scholars have appealed to incorporating public health and clinical medicine education, and breaking down separations between public health and clinical workforce in China, the effect is yet not so obvious. […] Consequently, the Chinese people have higher expectations on the modernization of public health governance, and the social atmosphere of incorporating preventive medicine and clinical medical education is establishing. […] In future, when combating with novel infectious diseases and public health emergencies, the response capacity of public health system and treatment capacity of clinical system will be significantly improved, while the situation on insufficient integration of prevention and treatment is bound to be reversed.

[…] The estimated median duration of fever in all the patients with fever was 10 days (95 confidential intervals [CIs]: 8-11 days) after onset of symptoms. […] Patients who were transferred to intensive care units (ICU) had significantly longer duration of fever as compared to those not in ICU (31 days v.s. 9 days after onset of symptoms, respectively, P &amp;lt;0.0001). […] Radiological aggravation of initial image was observed in 163 (65.7%) patients on day 7 after onset of symptoms.

[…] Retrospective case series. 88 cases of laboratory-confirmed and 3 cases of clinical-confirmed COVID-19 were admitted to five hospitals in Zhejiang province, China. […] Of all 91 patients, 88 (96.70%) were laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 with throat swab samples that tested positive for SARS-Cov-2 while 3 (3.30%) were clinical-diagnosed COVID-19 cases. […] The most common symptoms were fever (71.43%), cough (60.44%) and fatigue (43.96%).

[…] The differences and characteristics of the SV of COVID-19-related symptoms, and the correlation between the SV of COVID-19 and new confirmed or suspected cases were analyzed and the hysteresis effects were discussed. &lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; Compared the data from January 1 to February 20, 2020, with the SV for the same period of previous three years, Hubei’s SV for cough, fever, diarrhea, chest tightness, dyspnea and other symptoms were significantly increased. […] The total SV of lower respiratory symptoms was significantly higher than that of upper respiratory symptoms (P&amp;lt;0.001). […] The results of the distributed lag model suggested that the patients who retrieved relevant symptoms on the Internet may begin to see a doctor in 2-3 days later and be diagnosed in 3-4 days later. &lt;b&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/b&gt; The total SV of lower respiratory symptoms is higher than that of upper respiratory symptoms, and the SV of diarrhea also increased significantly. […] It warns us to pay attention to not only the symptoms of lower respiratory tract, but also the gastrointestinal symptoms, especially diarrhea in patients with COVID-19.

[…] In the pessimistic scenario of R0=4, and asymptomatic infections being half as infectious as symptomatic, this projected impact falls to two per cent. :Port-of-entry-based entry screening of travellers with suggestive clinical features and from COVID-19-affected countries, would achieve modest delays in the introduction of the virus into the community.

[…] Of patients with COVID-19 with GI symptoms, 17 (22.97%) and 23 (31.08%) had severe/critical types and family clustering, respectively, significantly higher than those without GI symptoms, 47 (8.14%) and 118 (20.45%). […] Of patients with COVID-19 with GI symptoms, 29 (39.19%), 23 (31.08%), 8 (10.81%) and 16 (21.62%) had significantly higher rates of fever &amp;gt;38.5°C, fatigue, shortness of breath and headache, respectively. […] We report COVID-19 cases with GI symptoms with novel features outside Wuhan. […] Attention to patients with COVID-19 with non-classic symptoms should increase to protect health providers.

&lt;b&gt;Objective:&lt;/b&gt; To investigate the clinical and coagulation characteristics of the critical Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with acro-ischemia in the intensive care unit (ICU). &lt;b&gt;Methods:&lt;/b&gt; The retrospective study included 7 critical COVID-19 patients with acro-ischemia in a single center in Wuhan, from Feb 4 to Feb 15, 2020. […] The clinical and laboratory data before and during the ICU stay were analyzed. &lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; The median age of 7 patients was 59 years and 4 of them were men. 3 of them were associated with underlying comorbidities. […] Fever, cough, dyspnea and diarrhea were common clinical symptoms. […] D-dimer and FDP levels increased progressively when COVID-2019 exacerbated, and 4 patients were diagnosed with definite disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). 6 patients received low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) treatment, after which their D-dimer and FDP decreased, but there was no significant improvement in clinical symptoms. 5 patients died finally and the median time from acro-ischemia to death was 12 days. &lt;b&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/b&gt; The existence of hypercoagulation status in critical COVID-2019 patients should be monitored closely, and anticoagulation therapy can be considered in selected patients. […] More clinical data is needed to investigate the role of anticoagulation in COVID-2019 treatment. &lt;b&gt;目的：&lt;/b&gt; 总结合并肢端缺血的新型冠状病毒肺炎（COVID-19）患者的临床和凝血参数特征。

[…] Adult and children patients can present with digestive symptoms in the absence of respiratory symptoms. […] The incidence of digestive manifestations was higher in the later than in the early stage of the epidemic, but no differences in digestive symptoms among different regions were found. […] Among the group of patients with a higher proportion of severe cases, the proportion of gastrointestinal symptoms in severe patients was higher than that in nonsevere patients (anorexia 66.7% vs 30.4%; abdominal pain 8.3% vs 0%); while in the group of patients with a lower severe rate, the proportion with gastrointestinal symptoms was similar in severe and nonsevere cases (nausea and vomiting 6.9% vs 4.6%; diarrhoea 5.8% vs 3.5%). […] Gastrointestinal symptoms are common in patients with COVID-19, and had an increased prevalence in the later stage of the recent epidemic in China.

The aim of this study was to explore the different clinical presentations between COVID-19 and influenza A (H1N1) pneumonia in patients with ARDS. […] Their clinical manifestations, imaging characteristics, treatments, and prognosis were analyzed and compared. […] Patients with COVID-19 exhibited higher proportions of nonproductive coughs, fatigue, and GI symptoms than those of patients with H1N1 (P &amp;lt; .05). […] There were many differences in clinical presentations between patients with ARDS infected with either COVID-19 or H1N1.

We assessed patterns of clinical disease and viral load from different samples (nasopharyngeal and blood, urine, and stool samples), which were obtained once daily for 3 days from hospital admission, and once every 2 or 3 days until patient discharge. […] Three different clinical evolutions are described: (1) two paucisymptomatic women diagnosed within a day of exhibiting symptoms, with high nasopharyngeal titres of SARS-CoV-2 within the first 24 h of the illness onset (5·2 and 7·4 log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; copies per 1000 cells, respectively) and viral RNA detection in stools; (2) a two-step disease progression in two young men, with a secondary worsening around 10 days after disease onset despite a decreasing viral load in nasopharyngeal samples; and (3) an 80-year-old man with a rapid evolution towards multiple organ failure and a persistent high viral load in lower and upper respiratory tract with systemic virus dissemination and virus detection in plasma. […] We illustrated three different clinical and biological types of evolution in five patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 with detailed and comprehensive viral sampling strategy.

Background and Purpose- Hyperacute assessment and management of patients with stroke, termed code stroke, is a time-sensitive and high-stakes clinical scenario. […] In the context of the current Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the ability to deliver timely and efficacious care must be balanced with the risk of infectious exposure to the clinical team. […] Furthermore, rapid and effective stroke care remains paramount to achieve maximal functional recovery for those needing admission and to triage care appropriately for those who may be presenting with neurological symptoms but have an alternative diagnosis. […] Methods- Available resources, COVID-19-specific infection prevention and control recommendations, and expert consensus were used to identify clinical screening criteria for patients and provide the required nuanced considerations for the healthcare team, thereby modifying the conventional code stroke processes to achieve a protected designation. […] Features specific to prenotification and clinical status of the patient were used to define precode screening. […] These include primary infectious symptoms, clinical, and examination features.

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&gt;
We performed a scoping review of currently available clinical, epidemiological, laboratory, and chest imaging data related to the SARS-CoV-2 infection. […] Qualitative synthesis and meta-analysis were conducted using the clinical and laboratory data, and random-effects models were applied to estimate pooled results. […] The most common disease-related symptoms were fever (82%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 56%-99%; &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 4410), cough (61%, 95% CI 39%-81%; &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 3985), muscle aches and/or fatigue (36%, 95% CI 18%-55%; &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 3778), dyspnea (26%, 95% CI 12%-41%; &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 3700), headache in 12% (95% CI 4%-23%, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 3598 patients), sore throat in 10% (95% CI 5%-17%, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 1387) and gastrointestinal symptoms in 9% (95% CI 3%-17%, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 1744). […] The majority of reported clinical symptoms and laboratory findings related to SARS-CoV-2 infection are non-specific. […] Clinical suspicion, accompanied by a relevant epidemiological history, should be followed by early imaging and virological assay.

By causing an early onset of severe symptoms, this same receptor tropism is thought to have determined pathogenicity, but also aided the control, of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;. […] However, there are reports of COVID-19 cases with mild upper respiratory tract symptoms, suggesting the potential for pre- or oligosymptomatic transmission&lt;sup&gt;6-8&lt;/sup&gt;. […] Pharyngeal virus shedding was very high during the first week of symptoms (peak at 7.11 × 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; RNA copies per throat swab, day 4). […] Shedding of viral RNA from sputum outlasted the end of symptoms.

Studies of the novel coronavirus-induced disease COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, have elucidated the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of this disease in the general population. […] The present investigation summarizes the clinical characteristics and early prognosis of COVID-19 infection in a cohort of patients with fractures. […] Analyses of early prognosis were based on clinical outcomes and trends in laboratory results during treatment. […] The clinical outcomes for the surviving patients are not yet determined. […] The clinical characteristics and early prognosis of COVID-19 in patients with fracture tended to be more severe than those reported for adult patients with COVID-19 without fracture. […] This finding may be related to the duration between the development of symptoms and presentation.

We comprehensively tested the pre-clinical immunogenicity of MERS-CoV vaccines in mice when delivered subcutaneously by traditional needle injection, or intracutaneously by dissolving microneedle arrays (MNAs) by evaluating virus specific IgG antibodies in the serum of vaccinated mice by ELISA and using virus neutralization assays. […] Driven by the urgent need for COVID-19 vaccines, we utilized this strategy to rapidly develop MNA SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccines and tested their pre-clinical immunogenicity in vivo by exploiting our substantial experience with MNA MERS-CoV vaccines. […] Here we describe the development of MNA delivered MERS-CoV vaccines and their pre-clinical immunogenicity. […] Building on our ongoing efforts to develop MERS-CoV vaccines, promising immunogenicity of MNA-delivered MERS-CoV vaccines, and our experience with MNA fabrication and delivery, including clinical trials, we rapidly designed and produced clinically-translatable MNA SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccines within 4 weeks of the identification of the SARS-CoV-2 S1 sequence. […] Collectively, our results support the clinical development of MNA delivered recombinant protein subunit vaccines against SARS, MERS, COVID-19, and other emerging infectious diseases.

[…] Our recommendations are as follows: 1. for inpatients with COVID-19, respiratory rehabilitation would relieve the symptoms of dyspnea, anxiety, and depression and eventually improve physical functions and the quality of life; 2. for severe/critical inpatients, early respiratory rehabilitation is not suggested; 3. for patients in isolation, respiratory rehabilitation guidance should be conducted through educational videos, instruction manuals, or remote consultation; 4. assessment and monitoring should be performed throughout the respiratory rehabilitation process; 5. proper grade protection should be used following the present guidelines. […] These recommendations can guide clinical practice and form the basis for respiratory rehabilitation in COVID-19 patients.

&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&gt;
More than 80 clinical trials have been launched to test coronavirus treatment, including some drug repurposing or repositioning for COVID-19. […] The eligibility criteria for the retrieved studies were: contain a clinicaltrials.gov base identifier number; describe the number of participants and the period for the study; describe the participants’ clinical conditions; and utilize interventions with medicines already studied or approved for any other disease in patients infected with the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV). […] We identified 24 clinical trials, involving more than 20 medicines, such as human immunoglobulin, interferons, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, arbidol, remdesivir, favipiravir, lopinavir, ritonavir, oseltamivir, methylprednisolone, bevacizumab, and traditional Chinese medicines (TCM). […] Although drug repurposing has some limitations, repositioning clinical trials may represent an attractive strategy because they facilitate the discovery of new classes of medicines; they have lower costs and take less time to reach the market; and there are existing pharmaceutical supply chains for formulation and distribution.

Outbreaks of novel agents represent opportunities for clinical research to inform real-time public health action. […] Here, we review information available on COVID-19 and provide an evidenced-based framework for priority clinical research in the current outbreak. […] Three bibliographic databases were searched to identify clinical studies published on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in the outbreak setting. […] Studies were grouped thematically according to clinical research questions addressed. […] From the research objectives for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, ten themes in the literature were identified: Clinical characterisation, prognosis, diagnosis, clinical management, viral pathogenesis, epidemiological characterisation, infection prevention and control/transmission, susceptibility, psychosocial, and aetiology. […] For COVID19, some information on clinical presentation, diagnostic testing, and aetiology is available but many clinical research gaps have yet to be filled. […] Based on a systematic review of other severe coronaviruses, we summarise the state of clinical research for COVID-19, highlight the research gaps, and provide recommendations for the implementation of standardised protocols. […] Data based on internationally standardised protocols will inform clinical practice real-time.

[…] Currently, there is no published evidence or case reports noting anosmia or ageusia as symptoms of COVID-19. […] Nevertheless, experts in rhinology have suggested that the onset of such symptoms could either act as a trigger for testing for the disease where possible, or could be a new criterion to self-isolate. […] Whilst more data is currently needed to strengthen our knowledge of the symptoms of COVID-19, oncology patients who are concerned about anosmia or ageusia in the context of their systemic anti-cancer therapy should contact their acute oncology support line for advice.

A large number of patients do not have overt signs and symptoms (fever/respiratory), yet pose a real risk to surgeons (who should know this fact and must therefore apply respiratory protective strategies for all patients they encounter). […] Health workers who are: pregnant, over 55 to 65 years of age, with a history of chronic diseases (uncontrolled hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, and all clinical scenarios where immunosuppression is feasible, including that induced to treat chronic inflammatory conditions and organ transplants) should avoid the clinical attention of a potentially infected patient. […] For those who are working with COVID-19 infected patients’ isolation is compulsory in the following settings: (a) unprotected close contact with COVID-19 pneumonia patients; (b) onset of fever, cough, shortness of breath, and other symptoms (gastrointestinal complaints, anosmia, and dysgeusia have been reported in a minority of cases).

Taking full advantage of the clinical experience of traditional Chinese medicine(TCM) in preventing and controlling major epidemics such as SARS, it is an important mission for TCM to propose effective formula with immediate response and solid evidence by using modern biomedical knowledge and techniques(molecular docking assisted TCM formulation for short). […] In view of the high homology between the gene sequences of the novel coronavirus and SARS virus, and the similarities between the two in terms of pathogenic mechanism and clinical manifestations, our team established a rapid screening and optimization model for the prevention and treatment of the novel coronavirus based on clinical experience and molecular docking technology. […] Firstly, the clinical team and the research team pre-developed and screened TCM formula by using &amp;amp;quot;back-to-back&amp;amp;quot; manner. […] The result was largely consistent with the formula raised by the clinical group, verifying and supporting its rationality. […] This provides evidence for the scientific and potential efficacy of the TCM prescription from the perspective of treatment target analysis, and also suggests that the TCM prescription has the potential to directly inhibit viral infection in addition to improving clinical symptoms or syndromes. […] Based on this, our team optimized and formed a new anti-coronavirus TCM prescription &amp;amp;quot;Keguan Yihao&amp;amp;quot;, immediately providing the TCM prescription with certain clinical experience and objective evidence support for the prevention and treatment of new emergent infectious diseases in our hospital. […] The TCM prescription was combined with modern medicine symptomatic supportive treatment for clinical treatment, preliminary results showed better effect than symptomatic supportive therapy alone. […] This research has innovated the method mode in clinical practice and basic research integration of traditional Chinese medicine for the prevention and control of new emerging infectious diseases.

[…] The clinical decision support component in HHS was also provided to improve patient care and prioritize the limited medical resources. […] However, the statistical methods still require further evaluations to confirm clinical effectiveness and appropriateness of disposition assigned in this study, which warrants further investigation.

&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&gt;
Since the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in December 2019, various digestive symptoms have been frequently reported in patients infected with the virus. […] In this study, we aimed to further investigate the prevalence and outcomes of COVID-19 patients with digestive symptoms. […] All patients were confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction and were analyzed for clinical characteristics, laboratory data, and treatment. […] Although most patients presented to the hospital with fever or respiratory symptoms, we found that 103 patients (50.5%) reported a digestive symptom, including lack of appetite (81 [78.6%] cases), diarrhea (35 [34%] cases), vomiting (4 [3.9%] cases), and abdominal pain (2 [1.9%] cases). […] Patients with digestive symptoms had a significantly longer time from onset to admission than patients without digestive symptoms (9.0 days vs 7.3 days). […] In 6 cases, there were digestive symptoms, but no respiratory symptoms. […] As the severity of the disease increased, digestive symptoms became more pronounced. […] Patients with digestive symptoms had higher mean liver enzyme levels, lower monocyte count, longer prothrombin time, and received more antimicrobial treatment than those without digestive symptoms. […] We found that digestive symptoms are common in patients with COVID-19. […] Clinicians should recognize that digestive symptoms, such as diarrhea, are commonly among the presenting features of COVID-19 and that the index of suspicion may need to be raised earlier in at-risk patients presenting with digestive symptoms.

[…] Psychiatrists should call their clozapine patients and families and explain to them that if the patient develops fever or flu-like symptoms, the psychiatrist should be called and should consider halving the clozapine dose. […] If the patient is hospitalized with pneumonia, the treating physician needs to assess for symptoms of clozapine intoxication since halving the dose may not be enough for all patients; consider decreasing it to one-third or even stopping it.

Since its outbreak in December 2019, a series of clinical trials on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been registered or carried out. […] This study aimed to develop a core outcome set (COS) for clinical trials on COVID-19 in order to tackle the outcome issues. […] A research group was set up that included experts in respiratory and critical medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, evidence-based medicine, clinical pharmacology, and statistics, in addition to medical journal editors. […] Clinical trial registry websites (chictr.org.cn and clinicaltrials.gov) were searched to retrieve clinical trial protocols and outcomes in order to form an outcome pool. […] A total of 78 clinical trial protocols on COVID-19 were included and 259 outcomes were collected. […] After two rounds of Delphi survey and one consensus meeting, the most important outcomes for the different clinical classifications of COVID-19 were identified and determined to constitute the COS for clinical trials on COVID-19 (COS-COVID). […] The COS-COVID includes one outcome for the mild type (time to 2019-nCoV reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) negativity), four outcomes for the ordinary type (length of hospital stay, composite events, score of clinical symptoms, and time to 2019-nCoV RT-PCR negativity), five outcomes for the severe type (composite events, length of hospital stay, arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), duration of mechanical ventilation, and time to 2019-nCoV RT-PCR negativity), one outcome for critical type (all-cause mortality), and one outcome for rehabilitation period (pulmonary function). […] The COS-COVID is currently the most valuable and practical clinical outcome set for the evaluation of intervention effect, and is useful for evidence assessment and decision-making.

Fourteen (32.6%) patients presented without any COVID-associated viral symptoms, and were identified either after developing symptoms during admission or following the implementation of universal testing for all obstetrical admissions on March 22. […] Of these, 10/14 (71.4%) developed symptoms or signs of COVID-19 infection over the course of their delivery admission or early after postpartum discharge. […] Of the other 29 (67.4%) patients who presented with symptomatic COVID-19 infection, three women ultimately required antenatal admission for viral symptoms, and an additional patient represented six days postpartum after a successful labor induction with worsening respiratory status that required oxygen supplementation.

[…] From an initial screen of 433 titles, two randomized trials and 24 observational studies provided clinical outcome data on the use of antiretroviral drugs; most studies reported outcomes using LPV/r as treatment. […] In one randomized trial 99 patients with severe COVID-19 illness were randomized to receive LPV/r (400/100 mg twice a day) and 100 patients to standard of care for 14 days: LPV/r was not associated with a statistically significant difference in time to clinical improvement, although LPV/r given within 12 days of symptoms was associated with shorter time to clinical improvement; 28 day mortality was numerically lower in the LPV/r group (14/99) compared to the control group (25/100), but this difference was not statistically significant. […] On the basis of the available evidence it is uncertain whether LPV/r and other antiretrovirals improve clinical outcomes or prevent infection among patients at high risk of acquiring COVID-19.

Neurological symptoms were rarely reported in the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV epidemics, although isolated cases were described. […] There are also reports of cases of neurological symptoms associated with CoV-OC43 and CoV-229E infection. […] Although neurological symptoms are not frequent in coronavirus epidemics, the high number of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection may explain the presence of the virus in the CNS and increase the likelihood of early- or delayed-onset neurological symptoms.

[…] Logistic regression was used to evaluate relationship between clinical parameters and CT metrics versus patient outcome (ICU admission/death vs. no ICU admission/ death). […] In comparison with clinical model containing only clinical parameters (AUC, 0.83), all three quantitative models showed higher diagnostic performance (AUC 0.86 for all models). […] The models containing %V-WAL&amp;lt;73% and VOL-WAL&amp;lt;2.9L were superior in terms of performance as compared to the models containing only clinical parameters (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;=0.04 for both models).

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) most commonly presents with respiratory symptoms, including cough, shortness of breath, and sore throat. […] However, digestive symptoms also occur in patients with COVID-19 and are often described in outpatients with less severe disease. […] In this study, we sought to describe the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with digestive symptoms and mild disease severity. […] We identified COVID-19 patients with mild disease and one or more digestive symptoms (diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting), with or without respiratory symptoms, and compared them with a group presenting solely with respiratory symptoms. […] We then compared the clinical features between those with digestive symptoms and those with respiratory symptoms. […] There were 206 patients with low severity COVID-19, including 48 presenting with a digestive symptom alone, 69 with both digestive and respiratory symptoms, and 89 with respiratory symptoms alone. […] Between the 2 groups with digestive symptoms, 67 presented with diarrhea, of whom 19.4% experienced diarrhea as the first symptom in their illness course. […] Patients with digestive symptoms presented for care later than those with respiratory symptoms (16.0 ± 7.7 vs 11.6 ± 5.1 days, P &amp;lt; 0.001). […] Nevertheless, patients with digestive symptoms had a longer duration between symptom onset and viral clearance (P &amp;lt; 0.001) and were more likely to be fecal virus positive (73.3% vs 14.3%, P = 0.033) than those with respiratory symptoms. […] We describe a unique subgroup of COVID-19 patients with mild disease severity marked by the presence of digestive symptoms. […] These patients are more likely to test positive for viral RNA in stool, to have a longer delay before viral clearance, and to experience delayed diagnosis compared with patients with only respiratory symptoms.

AZ is not approved for the treatment of viral infections, and there is no well-controlled, prospective, randomized clinical evidence to support AZ therapy in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). […] It is essential that the clinical pharmacology (CP) characteristics of AZ be considered in planning and conducting clinical trials of AZ alone or in combination with other agents, to ensure safe study conduct and to increase the probability of achieving definitive answers regarding efficacy of AZ in the treatment of COVID-19. […] The safety profile of AZ used as an antibacterial agent is well established.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; This work assesses published in vitro and clinical evidence for AZ as an agent with antiviral properties. […] It also provides basic CP information relevant for planning and initiating COVID-19 clinical studies with AZ, summarizes safety data from healthy volunteer studies, and safety and efficacy data from phase II and phase II/III studies in patients with uncomplicated malaria, including a phase II/III study in pediatric patients following administration of AZ and CQ in combination.

In humans, CoVs mostly cause respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms. […] Clinical manifestations range from a common cold to more severe disease such as bronchitis, pneumonia, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure and even death. […] SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 seem to less commonly affect children and to cause fewer symptoms and less severe disease in this age group compared with adults, and are associated with much lower case-fatality rates. […] Preliminary evidence suggests children are just as likely as adults to become infected with SARS-CoV-2 but are less likely to be symptomatic or develop severe symptoms. […] Children more often have gastrointestinal symptoms compared with adults. […] The majority of children infected by novel CoVs have a documented household contact, often showing symptoms before them. […] In this review, we summarize epidemiologic, clinical and diagnostic findings, as well as treatment and prevention options for common circulating and novel CoVs infections in humans with a focus on infections in children.

Some pathophysiological reasons have been hypothesized regarding the frequently observed increase in troponin levels in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, but, at the moment, these data could already suggest some clinical management implications, also with the aim of prospectively collecting research data: a troponin dosage should be considered, as a prognostic indicator, in all patients with moderate/severe COVID-19 at hospital admission, periodically during hospitalization, and in the case of clinical deterioration. […] In those patients with increased troponin levels, serial determinations should be carried out to define the enzymatic trajectory and therefore also the degree of clinical attention that must necessarily be closer in those who turn out to have persistently high or increasing troponin levels.

&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&gt;
The objectives of this study were to analyze the clinical features of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and evaluate the diagnosis and treatment. […] A retrospective analysis of the clinical manifestation and auxiliary examination of 19 patients with COVID-19 from the Liyuan Hospital intensive care unit (ICU) between January 16, 2020 and February 20, 2020 was undertaken. […] The clinical laboratory indices change significantly, especially the D-dimer level among non-survivors.

While novel vaccines and drugs that target SARS-CoV-2 are under development, this review provides information on therapeutics which are under clinical trials or are proposed to antagonize SARS-CoV-2. […] Since several antiviral therapies can inhibit viral replication cycles or relieve symptoms, mechanisms unique to RNA viruses will be important for the clinical development of antivirals against SARS-CoV-2.

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&gt;
Since the declaration of the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak as pandemic, there are reports on the increased prevalence of physical symptoms observed in the general population. […] We investigated the association between psychological outcomes and physical symptoms among healthcare workers. […] The prevalence of physical symptoms displayed by healthcare workers and the associations between physical symptoms and psychological outcomes of depression, anxiety, stress, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were evaluated. […] The commonest reported symptom was headache (32.3%), with a large number of participants (33.4%) reporting more than four symptoms. […] Participants who had experienced symptoms in the preceding month were more likely to be older, have pre-existing comorbidities and a positive screen for depression, anxiety, stress, and PTSD. […] After adjusting for age, gender and comorbidities, it was found that depression (OR 2.79, 95% CI 1.54-5.07, p = 0.001), anxiety (OR 2.18, 95% CI 1.36-3.48, p = 0.001), stress (OR 3.06, 95% CI 1.27-7.41, p = 0.13), and PTSD (OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.12-4.35, p = 0.023) remained significantly associated with the presence of physical symptoms experienced in the preceding month. […] Linear regression revealed that the presence of physical symptoms was associated with higher mean scores in the IES-R, DASS Anxiety, Stress and Depression subscales. […] Our study demonstrates a significant association between the prevalence of physical symptoms and psychological outcomes among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 outbreak. […] We postulate that this association may be bi-directional, and that timely psychological interventions for healthcare workers with physical symptoms should be considered once an infection has been excluded.

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&gt;
In fact, the main clinical manifestation of COVID-19 patients is represented by an acute hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, that in many cases, results in an acute respiratory distress syndrome and requires an invasive ventilator support. […] It can also limit the room contamination, improve comfort for the patients, and allow for better clinical assistance with long-term tolerability.

&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&gt;
Our objective was to evaluate three sample-to-answer molecular diagnostic platforms (Cepheid Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2 [Xpert Xpress], Abbott ID NOW™ COVID-19 [ID NOW], GenMark ePlex® SARS-CoV-2 Test [ePlex]) to determine analytical sensitivity, clinical performance, and workflow for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swabs from 108 symptomatic patients. […] In the workflow analysis, the ID NOW produced the most rapid time to result per specimen (∼17 minutes) as compared to the Xpert Xpress (∼46 minutes) and the ePlex (∼1.5 hours), but what the ID NOW gained in rapid results, it lost in analytical and clinical performance. […] Information about the clinical and analytical performance of these assays, as well as workflow, will be critical in making informed and timely decisions on testing platform.

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&gt;
There were no significant differences in the severity of psychiatric symptoms between workers/technicians and executives/managers. &amp;gt;95% reported psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures including good ventilation in the workplace and wore a face mask as protective. […] Factors that were associated with the severity of psychiatric symptoms in the workforce were marital status, presence of physical symptom, poor physical health and viewing return to work as a health hazard (p &amp;lt; 0.05). […] In contrast, personal psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures including hand hygiene and wearing face masks as well as organizational measures including significant improvement of workplace hygiene and concerns from the company were associated with less severe psychiatric symptoms (p &amp;lt; 0.05). […] Contrary to expectations, returning to work had not caused a high level of psychiatric symptoms in the workforce. […] The low prevalence of psychiatric symptoms could be due to confidence instilled by psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures before the resumption of work.

Considering the current pandemic of COVID-19, it is imperative to gauge the role of molecular divergence in SARS-CoV-2 with time, due to clinical and epidemiological concerns. […] We believe that such molecular analyses correlated with clinical characteristics and host predisposition need to be evaluated at the earliest to understand viral adaptability, disease prognosis, and transmission dynamics.

&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&gt;
Tocilizumab, which is the IL-6 receptor antagonist, has been approved by the US FDA for the treatment of cytokine release syndrome (CRS), is expected to treat cytokine storm caused by COVID-19 and is now in clinical trials. […] In this paper, we will elaborate the role of cytokine storm in COVID-19, the mechanism of tocilizumab on cytokine storm and the key points of pharmaceutical care based on the actual clinical application for COVID-19 in our hospital, the latest research reports, clinical trial progress of tocilizumab, drug instruction from the US FDA, and “Diagnosis and Treatment Plan of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (seventh trial edition)” in China, so as to provide reference for the treatment of COVID-19.

The system is meant to be used in patients presenting with moderate to severe symptoms of COVID-19. […] The system was evaluated using 105 chest CTs of patients admitted to the hospital with clinical suspicion of COVID-19 in whom RT-PCR was performed (62 +/- 16 years, 61 men, 53 with positive RT-PCR). […] The resulting area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) was compared to results from RT-PCR and clinical diagnosis of COVID-19. […] The average AUC was 0.91 (95% CI 0.85-0.97) for predicting RT-PCR outcome and 0.95 (95% CI 0.91-0.99) for clinical diagnosis. […] Conclusions CO-RADS is a categorical assessment scheme for pulmonary involvement of COVID-19 on non-enhanced chest CT providing very good performance for predicting COVID-19 in patients with moderate to severe symptoms and has a substantial interobserver agreement, especially for categories 1 and 5.

An extensive strain was reported due to stress experience as well as depression and anxiety symptoms. […] Severe degrees of those symptoms were found in 2.2 % to 14.5 % of all participants. […] The severity of mental symptoms was influenced by age, gender, occupation, specialization, type of activities performed and proximity to COVID-19 patients.

[…] Digestive forms, which may be isolated or which can precede pulmonary symptoms, have indeed been reported, with diarrhea as a leading clinical sign. […] No data exist on the interest of digestive endoscopy in cases of persistent digestive symptoms.

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&gt;
The general recommendations to mitigate the potential detriment of an unexpected shortage of radiotherapy facilities include: (1) maintain current standards of care as long as possible (2) refer to another specialist paediatric radiotherapy department with similar level of expertise (3) prioritise use of existing radiotherapy resources to treat patients with tumours where radiotherapy has the most effect on clinical outcome (4) use chemotherapy to defer the start of radiotherapy where timing of radiotherapy is not expected to be detrimental (5) active surveillance for low-grade tumours if appropriate and (6) consider iso-effective hypofractionated radiotherapy regimens only for selected patients with predicted poor prognosis. […] It has wider applications for the optimal utilisation of facilities, to improve clinical outcome in low- and middle-income countries, where limited resources continue to be a challenge.

A wealth of data has been generated since its emergence in December 2019, and it is vital for clinicians to keep up with this data from across the world at a time of uncertainty and constantly evolving guidelines and clinical practice. […] Here we provide an update for clinicians on the recent developments in the virology, diagnostics, clinical presentation, viral shedding, and treatment options for COVID-19 based on current literature. […] We considered published peer-reviewed papers and non-peer-reviewed pre-print manuscripts on COVID19 and related aspects with an emphasis on clinical management aspects. […] We describe the virological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and the clinical course of COVID-19 with an emphasis on diagnostic challenges, duration of viral shedding, severity markers and current treatment options.

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&gt;
A novel virus named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2) causes symptoms that are classified as coronavirus disease (COVID-19). […] It was also revealed that alternative treatments currently being considered for COVID-19 such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine by increasing hemoglobin production and increasing hemoglobin availability for oxygen binding and acetazolamine (for the treatment of altitude sickness) by causing hyperventilation with associated increasing levels of oxygen and decreasing levels of carbon dioxide in the blood may significantly ameliorate COVID-19 respiratory symptoms. […] In conclusion, is recommend, given HBOT, pRBC, and ESA therapies are currently available and routinely utilized in the treatment of other conditions, that such therapies be tried among COVID-19 patients with serious respiratory conditions and that future controlled-clinical trials explore the potential usefulness of such treatments among COVID-19 patients with respiratory conditions.

[…] We discuss the underlying pathogenesis and the interaction between multiple systems, resulting in propagation of immunothrombosis, which through investigation in the coming weeks, may lead to both an improved understanding of COVID-19 pathophysiology and identification of innovative and efficient therapeutic targets to reverse the otherwise unfavorable clinical outcome of many of these patients.

&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&gt;
Without the protections provided to paid health care workers, students are uniquely disadvantaged within the medical hierarchy; these inequalities must be addressed before medical students are safely reintegrated into clinical roles. […] Although graduating medical students and institutional leadership may worry that suspending clinical rotations might prevent students from completing graduation requirements, the authors argue the ethical obligation to “flatten the curve” supersedes usual teaching responsibilities.

&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&gt;
The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) resulting from a distinctive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to evolve in many countries and pose life-threatening clinical issues to global public health. […] Though a significant portion of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals has been recovering from pathological symptoms, the impact of the COVID-19 on the structural and functional properties of the lungs, heart, brain and other organs at the post-recovery state remains unknown. […] However, a mild dose of the purified form of BoNT has been known to attenuate chronic cough, dyspnoea, pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, abnormal circulation, cardiac defects and various neurological deficits that have been recognised as the prominent clinical symptoms of COVID-19.

&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&gt;
The clinical presentation of European patients with mild-to-moderate Covid-19 infection is still unknown. […] To study the clinical presentation of Covid-19 in Europe. […] Epidemiological and clinical data were obtained through a standardized questionnaire. […] The most common symptoms were headache (70.3%), loss of smell (70.2%), nasal obstruction (67.8%), cough (63.2%), asthenia (63.3%), myalgia (62.5%), rhinorrhea (60.1%), gustatory dysfunction (54.2%) and sore throat (52.9%). […] The mean duration of Covid-19 symptoms of mild-to-moderate cured patients was 11.5±5.7 days. […] The prevalence of symptoms significantly varied according to age and sex.

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&gt;
Clinical characteristics and hemocyte counts of severe and non-severe COVID patients were collected. […] A concordance index (C-index), calibration curve, decision curve and the clinical impact curve were calculated to assess the predictive accuracy. […] A total of 82.8% of severe patients had lymphopenia after the onset of symptoms, and as the disease progressed, there was marked lymphopenia. […] The C-index (0.821 [95% CI, 0.746-0.896]), calibration curve, decision curve and the clinical impact curve showed that the nomogram can be used to predict the disease progression in COVID-19 patients accurately.

Due to the scientific community’s efforts, there is an increasing body of published studies describing the virus’ biology, its transmission and diagnosis, its clinical features, its radiological findings, and the development of candidate therapeutics and vaccines. […] Defining the pathophysiology of death is not only limited to forensic considerations; it may also provide useful clinical and epidemiologic insights. […] Only by working with a complete set of histological samples obtained through autopsy can one ascertain the exact cause(s) of death, optimize clinical management, and assist clinicians in pointing out a timely and effective treatment to reduce mortality.

The clinical complexity associated with the management of frailty may increase the risk of complications during infection as well as the lack of the early recognition of atypical symptoms.

The symptoms associated with COVID-19 are mainly characterized by a triad composed of fever, dry cough and dyspnea. […] However, digestive symptoms have also been reported. […] The symptoms mainly include anorexia, diarrhea, nausea and/or vomiting and abdominal pain. […] Even though prognosis is associated with lung injury, digestive symptoms seem significantly more frequent in patients presenting with severe COVID-19 infection. […] Digestive presentations, which may be isolated or which can precede pulmonary symptoms, have indeed been reported, with diarrhea as a leading clinical sign. […] No data exist on the value of digestive endoscopy in cases of persistent digestive symptoms. […] Fecal-oral transmission of the infection is possible, especially insofar as viral shedding in stools seems frequent and of longer duration than at the ENT level, including in patients with negative throat swab and without digestive symptoms.

However, the clinical characteristics of patients in other areas around Wuhan, Hubei Province are still unclear. […] In this study, we performed epidemiological and clinical characteristics analysis on these regional cases. […] Their epidemiological, clinical manifestations, and imaging characteristics were analysed. […] Among the 73 patients studied, 12.3 % developed symptoms after returning to Shiyan from Wuhan, and 71.2 % had a history of close contact with Wuhan personnel or confirmed cases. […] The first main symptoms presented by these patients were fever (84.9 %) and cough (21.9 %). […] The longest incubation period was 26 days, and the median interval from the first symptoms to admission was 5 days. […] Multivariate regression analysis should be used to further guide the allocation of clinical resources.

Data are urgently needed about risk factors associated with clinical outcomes.

[…] Clinical outcomes were designated as favorable and unfavorable, based on disease progression and response to treatments. […] Logistic regression models were performed to identify risk factors associated with clinical outcomes, and log-rank test was conducted for the association with clinical progression. […] By univariate logistic regression analysis, 27 risk factors were significantly associated with clinical outcomes. […] Multivariate regression indicated age over 65 years (p&amp;lt;0.001), smoking (p=0.001), critical disease status (p=0.002), diabetes (p=0.025), high hypersensitive troponin I (&amp;gt;0.04 pg/mL, p=0.02), leukocytosis (&amp;gt;10 x 109/L, p&amp;lt;0.001) and neutrophilia (&amp;gt;75 x 109/L, p&amp;lt;0.001) predicted unfavorable clinical outcomes. […] We also found novel risk factors, such as higher hypersensitive troponin I, predicted poor clinical outcomes.

We aimed to investigate the epidemiological and clinical features, and medical care-seeking process of patients with the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China, to provide useful information to contain COVID-19 in other places with similar outbreaks of the virus. […] We collected epidemiological and clinical information of patients with COVID-19 admitted to a makeshift Fangcang hospital between 7 and 26 February, 2020. […] After clinical recovery from COVID-19, which took a mean of 21 days from illness onset, there was still a substantial proportion of patients who had persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection. […] Clinical recovery is not an appropriate criterion to release isolated patients and as long as 4 weeks’ isolation for patients with COVID-19 is not enough to prevent the spread of the virus.

[…] Our analysis suggests that PD patients’ needs during COVID-19 emergency include appropriate and complete information, a timely update on changes in clinical services, and the continuity of care, even in a remote mode. […] By addressing these issues, acute clinical worsening, complications and subsequent therapeutic changes could be prevented.

COVID-19 runs its course in two phases, the initial incubation phase and later clinical symptomatic phase.

[…] At the later clinical symptomatic phase, the immune system is fully activated and the disease may enter the severe infection stage in this phase. […] Although many patients are known for their respiratory symptoms, they had neurological symptoms in their first 1-2 days of clinical symptomatic phase, and ischaemic stroke occurred 2 weeks after the onset of the clinical symptomatic phase.

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&gt;
In contrast, the COVID-19 pandemic has been harder to contain, partly because of its wide spectrum of symptoms in infectious hosts. […] Current evidence suggests that individuals can transmit the novel coronavirus while displaying few symptoms. […] Here, we show that the proportion of infections arising from hosts with few symptoms at the start of an outbreak can, in combination with the basic reproduction number, indicate whether or not interventions targeting symptomatic hosts are likely to be effective. […] However, as an outbreak continues, the proportion of infections arising from hosts with few symptoms changes in response to control measures. […] A high proportion of infections from hosts with few symptoms after the initial stages of an outbreak is only problematic if the rate of new infections remains high. […] This should be considered when interpreting estimates of the extent of transmission from hosts with few COVID-19 symptoms.

&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&gt;
Early screening and triage is achievable from the outset of a pandemic with point-of-care host immune response testing which will improve response time to clinical and public health actions.Key messagesDelayed testing deployment has led to uncertainty surrounding overall disease burden and community spread, severely hampering public health containment and healthcare system preparation efforts.A multi-tiered testing strategy incorporating rapid, host immune point-of-care tests can be used now and for future pandemic planning by effectively identifying patients at risk of disease thereby facilitating quarantine earlier in the progression of the outbreak during the weeks and months it can take for pathogen specific confirmatory tests to be developed, validated and manufactured in sufficient quantities.The ability to triage patients at the point of care and support the guidance of medical and therapeutic decisions, for viral isolation or confirmatory testing or for appropriate treatment of COVID-19 and/or bacterial infections, is a critical component to our national pandemic response and there is an urgent need to implement the proposed strategy to combat the current outbreak.

[…] The death cases were described from four aspects (gender and age characteristics, underlying diseases, the time course of death, symptoms at the incipience of illness and hospital admission). […] The median time between the first symptoms and death was 12.50 days (IQR = 10.00-16.25), while the median time between the admission and death was 8.50 (IQR = 5.00-12.00) days. […] In persons aged over 56 years, the time between the first symptoms and death decreased with age, and so did the time between the admission and death, though the latter increased again in persons aged over 85 years. […] The major first symptoms included fever (52.63%), cough (31.58%), dyspnea (23.68%), myalgia and fatigue (15.79%).

To date, there is no specific vaccine against the causative virus, SARS-CoV-2, nor is there an effective medicine for treating COVID-19, thus raising concerns with respect to the effect of risk factors such as clinical course and pathophysiological parameters on disease severity and outcome in patients with COVID-19. […] By extracting and analyzing all available published clinical data, we identified several major clinical characteristics associated with increased disease severity and mortality among patients with COVID-19. […] Moreover, additional clinical data are needed in order to determine whether a supportive therapy can help mitigate the development of severe, potentially fatal complications, and further studies are needed to identify the pathophysiology and the mechanism underlying this novel coronavirus-associated infectious disease. […] Taken together, these findings provide new insights regarding clinical strategies for improving the management and outcome of patients with COVID-19.

The COVID-19 outbreak is presenting the health system with new challenges, and there is a great need for knowledge about symptoms, clinical findings and course of illness in patients admitted to Norwegian hospitals with COVID-19. […] We present here patient characteristics, symptoms, clinical findings, experience of using clinical scoring systems and course of illness based on data in medical records. […] Fever (79 %), reduced general condition (79 %), dyspnoea (69 %) and cough (67 %) were the most common symptoms. […] Most patients admitted to our hospital with COVID-19 had a fever and respiratory tract symptoms.

• Clinical evaluation should guide those needing investigation • Strict adherence to COVID-19 protection measures is necessary • Alternative ways of consultations (telephone, video) should be used • Early discussion with regional/national experts about investigation and management of potential and existing patients is strongly encouraged • Patients with moderate and severe clinical features need urgent investigation and management • Patients with active Cushing’s syndrome, especially when severe, are immunocompromised and social shielding is recommended • In patients with mild features or in whom a diagnosis is less likely, clinical re-evaluation should be repeated at three and six months or deferred until the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 has significantly decreased • Diagnostic pathways may need to be very different from usual recommendations in order to reduce investigations • When extensive differential diagnostic testing is not feasible, it should be deferred, and medical treatment should be initiated • Transsphenoidal pituitary surgery may be avoided during high SARS-CoV-2 viral prevalence • Medical management rather than surgery will be the used for most patients since the short- to mid-term prognosis depends in most cases on hypercortisolism rather than its cause; it should be initiated promptly to minimize the risk of infection in these immunosuppressed patients.

&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&gt;
The clinical data including age, sex, exposure history, laboratory parameters and aetiological diagnosis of all patients were collected.

Therefore, it is necessary to understand the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in children and the differences from adults. […] The patient continued to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the nasopharyngeal swabs and stool at 17 days after the disappearance of symptoms. […] The present pediatric case of COVID-19 was acquired through household transmission, and the symptoms were mild. […] The RNA of SARS-CoV-2 in stool and nasopharyngeal swabs remained positive for an extended period of time after the disappearance of symptoms. […] This suggests that attention should be given to the potential contagiousness of pediatric COVID-19 cases after clinical recovery.

Although screening all patients with respiratory symptoms for COVID-19 has been recommended, the practicality of such an effort has yet to be assessed. […] Over a 6-week period during a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, our institution introduced a “respiratory surveillance ward” (RSW) to segregate all patients with respiratory symptoms in designated areas, where appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) could be utilized until SARS-CoV-2 testing was done.

[…] While laboratory-developed testing for SARS-CoV-2 is an essential component of diagnostic testing for this virus, the majority of clinical microbiology laboratories are dependent on commercially available SARS-CoV-2 molecular assays. […] Outside of highly specialized academic and commercial laboratory settings, clinical microbiology laboratories are likely unfamiliar with EUA classification and thus assay verification can be daunting.

[…] Effective reproductive number &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;) analysis using observed frequencies showed a remarkable decline after the implementation of clinical diagnostic criteria and universal symptom surveys, which was significantly below the &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;) curve estimated by the model assuming that the pre-February 14 trend was carried forward.

&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&gt;
Seventy clinical colleagues of the authors were emailed and invited to share their concerns online about how to deliver cognitive-behavioral therapy for eating disorders (CBT-ED) via telehealth, and how to adapt clinical practice to deal with the problems that they and others had encountered. […] A large proportion were general clinical and practical domains (patient and therapist concerns about telehealth; technical issues in implementing telehealth; changes in the environment), but there were also specific considerations and clinical recommendations about the delivery of CBT-ED methods.

&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&gt;
Chlorpromazine (CPZ) is a phenothiazine derivative widely used in clinical routine in the treatment of acute and chronic psychoses. […] In comparison to other antiviral drugs, the main advantages of CPZ lie in its biodistribution: (i) preclinical and clinical studies have reported a high CPZ concentration in the lungs (20-200 times higher than in plasma), which is critical because of the respiratory tropism of SARS-CoV-2; (ii) CPZ is highly concentrated in saliva (30-100 times higher than in plasma) and could therefore reduce the contagiousness of COVID-19; (iii) CPZ can cross the blood-brain barrier and could therefore prevent the neurological forms of COVID-19. […] At this end, we designed a pilot, phase III, multicenter, single blind, randomized controlled clinical trial. […] Efficacy of CPZ will be assessed according to clinical, biological and radiological criteria. […] Response to treatment is defined by a reduction of at least one level of severity on the WHO-Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement (WHO-OSCI). […] The secondary objectives are to demonstrate in the CPZ+SOC group, compared to the SOC group: (A) superior clinical improvement; (B) a greater decrease in the biological markers of viral attack by SARS-CoV-2 (PCR, viral load); (C) a greater decrease in inflammatory markers (e.g. […] Indeed, CPZ is an FDA-approved drug with an excellent tolerance profile, prescribed for around 70 years in psychiatry but also in clinical routine in nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, in advanced cancer and also to treat headaches in various neurological conditions. […] The discovery of those CPZ properties, as for many other molecules in psychiatry, is both the result of serendipity and careful clinical observations.

&lt;b&gt;Objective:&lt;/b&gt; To evaluate the efficacy and safety of lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) and arbidol in the treatment of COVID-19 in the real world. &lt;b&gt;Methods:&lt;/b&gt; The clinical data of 178 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 admitted to Guangzhou Eighth People’s Hospital were retrospectively analyzed from January 21 to February 9, 2020. […] There was also no significant difference in the rate of negative conversion rate of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid, the improvement ration in clinical symptoms, and the improvement ration of pulmonary infection in the lung CT imaging (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;gt; 0.05). […] Moreover, the frequency of adverse reactions in the three groups receiving antiviral drugs was significantly higher than that in the conventional treatment group (&lt;i&gt;χ(2)&lt;/i&gt; = 14.875, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002). &lt;b&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/b&gt; No evidences could prove that LPV/r and arbidol could shorten the negative conversion time of novel coronavirus nucleic acid in pharyngeal swab nor improve the symptoms of patients.

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&gt;
The aging process is characterized by the gradual development of a chronic subclinical systemic inflammation (inflamm-aging) and by acquired immune system impairment (immune senescence). […] Here, we advance the hypothesis that four well-recognized features of aging contribute to the disproportionate SARS-CoV-2 mortality suffered by elderly men: i. the presence of subclinical systemic inflammation without overt disease, ii. a blunted acquired immune system and type I interferon response due to the chronic inflammation; iii. the downregulation of ACE2 (i.e. the SARS-CoV-2 receptor); and iv. accelerated biological aging.

Potential risks associated with COVID-19 infection should be considered, considering tumor histology and natural course, disease setting, clinical conditions, and disease burden, together with the expected benefit, toxicities (e.g., myelosuppression or interstitial lung disease), and response obtained from the planned or ongoing treatment. […] Proactive management and containment measures, applied in a structured and daily way, has significantly aided the identification of advance patients with suspected symptoms related to COVID-19, limiting their admission to our cancer center; we have thus been more able to protect other patients from possible contamination and at the same time guarantee to the suspected patients the immediate treatment and evaluation in referral hospitals for COVID-19.

[…] Key determinants of robust thoracic surgery service provision included: preexisting plans for an epidemic response, aggressive early action to “flatten the curve”, ability to dedicate resources separately to COVID-19 and routine clinical services, prioritization of thoracic surgery, and the volume of COVID-19 cases in that region.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has disrupted all aspects of clinical care, including cancer clinical trials. […] In March 2020, ASCO launched a survey of clinical programs represented on its Cancer Research Committee and Research Community Forum Steering Group and taskforces to learn about the types of changes and challenges that clinical trial programs were experiencing early in the pandemic. […] Respondents indicated that COVID-19 is leading programs to halt or prioritize screening and/or enrollment for certain clinical trials and cease research-only visits. […] Numerous challenges with conducting clinical trials were reported, including enrollment and protocol adherence difficulties with decreased patient visits, staffing constraints, and limited availability of ancillary services. […] The changes in clinical trial procedures identified by the survey could serve as strategies for other programs attempting to maintain their clinical trial portfolios during the COVID-19 pandemic. […] Additionally, many of the adaptations to trials made during the pandemic provide a long-term opportunity to improve and transform the clinical trial system. […] Specific improvements could be expanded use of more pragmatic or streamlined trial designs, fewer clinical trial-related patient visits, and minimized sponsor and CRO visits to trial programs.

[…] Pregnant women with suspected hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and signs and symptoms associated with the severe end of the disease spectrum (e.g., headaches, visual symptoms, epigastric pain, and pulmonary edema) should have an evaluation including complete blood count, serum creatinine level, and liver transaminases (aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase).

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&gt;
We argue for inhibition of the TRPV4 calcium-permeable ion channel as a strategy to address this issue, based on the rationale that TRPV4 inhibition is protective in various preclinical models of lung edema, and that TRPV4 hyperactivation potently damages the alveolo-capillary barrier, with lethal outcome. […] A clinical trial using a selective TRPV4 inhibitor demonstrated a benign safety profile in healthy volunteers and in patients suffering from cardiogenic lung edema. […] We argue for expeditious clinical testing of this inhibitor in Covid-19 patients with respiratory malfunction and at risk for lung edema.

To describe the clinical and analytical features of a coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) infected cohort with SCI to enable accurate diagnosis and to outline prevention measures. […] Clinical, analytical, and radiographic findings were registered. […] Our patients with SCI and Covid-19 infection exhibited fewer symptoms than the general population. […] Furthermore, they presented similar or greater clinical severity. […] The clinical evolution was not as pronounced as had been expected. […] This study recommends close supervision of the SCI population to detect early compatible signs and symptoms of Covid-19 infection.

[…] We analysed findings from 35 studies, including 6686 patients with COVID-19, that met inclusion criteria. 29 studies (n=6064) reported gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with COVID-19 at diagnosis, and the pooled prevalence of digestive system comorbidities was 4% (95% CI 2-5; range 0-15; &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=74%). […] The pooled prevalence of digestive symptoms was 15% (10-21; range: 2-57; &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=96%) with nausea or vomiting, diarrhoea, and loss of appetite being the three most common symptoms. […] Subgroup analysis showed patients with severe COVID-19 had higher rates of gastrointestinal symptoms (odds ratio [OR] 1·60 [95% CI 1·09-2·36]; p=0·0020; &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=44%) and liver injury (2·20 [1·60-3·02]; p&amp;lt;0·00001; &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=36%) compared with those with non-severe disease. […] Paediatric patients with COVID-19 had a similar prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms to those of adult patients. […] 10% (95% CI 4-19; range 3-23; &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=97%) of patients presented with gastrointestinal symptoms alone without respiratory features.

[…] The following data were obtained from electronic medical records: demographics, medical history, exposure history, underlying comorbidities, symptoms, signs, laboratory findings, computer tomography scans, and treatment measures. […] Main outcome measure Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatments. […] The median time from the first symptoms to hospital admission was seven days. […] The most common symptoms at the onset of illness were fever (74.5%), cough (56.9%), and fatigue (43.1%) among patients in the common-type group. […] Conclusion As of February 10, 2020, the symptoms of COVID-19 patients in Hunan province were relatively mild comparing to patients in Wuhan, the epicenter.

&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&gt;
It is extremely important to understand the prevalence and influencing factors of anxiety and depression symptoms in first-line anti-epidemic medical staff and their coping styles for these negative emotions. […] A linear regression model was used to determine the influencing factors for anxiety or depression symptoms. […] The prevalence rates of anxiety and depression symptoms among doctors was 11.4% and 45.6%, respectively. […] History of depression or anxiety (T=-2.644, p= 0.010, 95%CI: -10.514~-1.481) was shown to be a risk factor for anxiety symptoms in doctors, while being male (T=2.970, p=0.004, 95%CI: 2.667~13.521) was a protective factor for depression. […] The prevalence rate of anxiety and depression symptoms among nurses was 27.9% and 43.0%, respectively. […] History of depression or anxiety was a common risk factor for anxiety symptoms (T=-3.635, p=0.000, 95%CI: -16.360~-4.789) and depression symptoms (T=-2.835, p=0.005, 95%CI:-18.238~-3.254) in nurses. […] The first-line anti-epidemic medical staff have high anxiety and depression symptoms and adopting positive coping styles will help to improve their negative emotions.

Moreover, the rapid onset of societal disruption and evolving regulatory restrictions may not have allowed for systematic planning of how clinical and research work may continue throughout the pandemic or be restarted as restrictions are abated. […] To facilitate the re-establishment of access to NIBS clinical services and research operations during the current COVID-19 pandemic and possible future outbreaks, we develop and discuss a framework for balancing the importance of NIBS operations with safety considerations, while addressing the needs of all stakeholders. […] The document reflects the analysis of experts with domain-relevant expertise spanning NIBS technology, clinical services, and basic and clinical research - with an international perspective. […] We discuss COVID-19 considerations specifically for clinical (sub-)populations including pediatric, stroke, addiction, and the elderly.

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&gt;
Using a mixed-method triangulation design (QUAN + QUAL), this study investigated and compared the mental status and inflammatory markers of 103 patients who, while hospitalized with mild symptoms, tested positive with COVID-19 and 103 matched controls that were COVID-19 negative. […] The severity of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) was measured via an on-line survey. […] Results revealed that COVID-19 patients, when compared to non-COVID controls, manifested higher levels of depression (P &amp;lt; 0.001), anxiety (P &amp;lt; 0.001), and post-traumatic stress symptoms (P &amp;lt; 0.001). […] Levels of CRP, a peripheral inflammatory indicator, correlated positively with the PHQ-9 total score (R = .37, P = 0.003, Spearman’s correlation) of patients who presented symptoms of depression. […] Moreover, the change of CRP level from baseline inversely correlated with the PHQ-9 total score (R = -0.31, P = 0.002), indicative of improvement of depression symptoms. […] Thus, we recommend that necessary measures should be provided to address depression and other psychiatric symptoms for COVID-19 patients and attention should be paid to patient perceived stigma and coping strategies when delivering psychological interventions.

&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&gt;
The COVID-19 pandemics required several changes in stroke management and it may have influenced some clinical or functional characteristics. […] We analyzed admitted patients’ clinical features and outcomes between 9th March 2020 and 9th April 2020 (first month of lockdown), and compared them with patients admitted during the same period in 2019. […] Similar ‘symptoms alert-to-admission’ and ‘door-to-treatment’ times were observed. […] In conclusion, the adopted strategies for stroke management during the COVID-19 emergency have suggested being effective, while suffering a reduced and delayed reporting of symptoms. […] Therefore, we recommend raising awareness among the population against possible stroke symptoms onset.

First, the clinical observations of the French Pharmacovigilance Network showed that severe bacterial infections can occur even after a short NSAID treatment, and even if the NSAID is associated with an antibiotic. […] Therefore, in case of infection, symptomatic treatment with NSAIDs for non-severe symptoms (fever, pain, or myalgia) is not to be recommended, given a range of clinical and scientific arguments supporting an increased risk of severe bacterial complication.

[…] We developed a check-list of respiratory, gastro-intestinal and other less-specific symptoms, summarized in a table and easily to be filled-up by patients, nurses and general practitioners. […] As second step, we reported the clinical phases of this disease.

Case reports and case series depicting the clinical effects of the causative virus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been published, yet few demonstrate the cytopathologic alterations of this disease. […] We present a clinical-pathological correlation report of a previously healthy Hispanic woman with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who had typical features of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and also showed cardiac abnormalities thought to represent fulminant viral myocarditis. […] Congruent with the ARDS clinical impression, autopsy findings were remarkable for extensive and markedly severe acute lung injury consistent with viral pneumonia, characterized by diffuse alveolar damage, pulmonary infarction, severe pulmonary edema, desquamation of pneumocytes with intraalveolar aggregation, and pneumocyte morphological alterations suspicious for viral cytopathic effect. […] However, there was incongruence between the clinical impression and the cardiovascular pathology findings in that viral myocarditis was not detected on histopathologic evaluation. […] This case highlights the importance of pathologic corroboration of the clinical impression and, in addition, illuminates the key role autopsy plays during a pandemic by providing valuable insight into viral pathology in tissues.

[…] In February and March 2020, we explored the somatic symptoms and concerns regarding COVID-19 of 399 college and primary school students in Sichuan Province using the Somatic Self-rating Scale (SSS) and a novel questionnaire, respectively. […] The incidence of somatic symptoms among college students was 34.85 (mild, 26.26%; moderate, 8.59%). […] The incidence of somatic symptoms in primary school students was 2.39% (all mild). […] Among the entire cohort, concern regarding COVID-19 was positively correlated with the occurrence of somatic symptoms. […] Somatic symptoms were more likely among college students expressing greater concern regarding the threat to life and health posed by COVID-19, and the efficacy of prevention and control measures. […] Among primary school students, only the concern for life and health was associated with a higher likelihood of somatic symptoms.

[…] Remdesivir use was not associated with a difference in time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio 1·23 [95% CI 0·87-1·75]). […] Although not statistically significant, patients receiving remdesivir had a numerically faster time to clinical improvement than those receiving placebo among patients with symptom duration of 10 days or less (hazard ratio 1·52 [0·95-2·43]). […] In this study of adult patients admitted to hospital for severe COVID-19, remdesivir was not associated with statistically significant clinical benefits.

We recommend establishing an alternative feasible system, such as self-isolation by contact history in non-endemic community and by symptoms in endemic community, not relying on the PCR examination, to minimize this ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. […] Further rapid accumulation of knowledge including incubation period, clinical course and types of transmission is warranted to control this outbreak.

The COVID-19 pandemic has generated an imbalance between the clinical needs of the population and the effective availability of advanced life support (ALS) resources. […] Lacking national guidance or public coordination, each hospital has been forced to put forth independent and autonomous triage protocols, most of which were, nonetheless, based on common ethical principles and clinical criteria. […] However, controversial, non-clinical criteria have also been defended by Spanish scientific societies and public institutions, including setting an age cut-off value for unilaterally withholding ALS, using ‘social utility’ criteria, prioritising healthcare professionals or using ‘first come, first served’ policies.

Since COVID-19 symptoms are aspecific and may resemble a common cold, if it should come back with a seasonal pattern and coincide with the influenza season, this would be particularly challenging, overwhelming and straining the healthcare systems, particularly in resource-limited contexts, and would increase the likelihood of nosocomial transmission. […] In the present study, we devised a mathematical model focusing on the treatment of people complaining of influenza-like-illness (ILI) symptoms, potentially at risk of contracting COVID-19 or other emerging/re-emerging respiratory infectious agents during their admission at the health-care setting, who will occupy the detection kits causing a severe shortage of testing resources.

&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&gt;
We assessed the prevalence, clinical presentation and outcomes of dementia among subjects hospitalized for COVID19 infection. […] Clinical records of each patients admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of COVID19 infection were retrospectively analyzed. […] Diagnosis of dementia, modalities of onset of the COVID-19 infection, symptoms of presentation at the hospital and outcomes were recorded. […] Among patients diagnosed with dementia the most frequent symptoms of onset were delirium, especially in the hypoactive form, and worsening of the functional status. […] The clinical presentation of COVID-19 in subjects with dementia is atypical, reducing early recognition of symptoms and hospitalization.

The antibody positive rates were very low in the first five days after initial onset of symptoms, and then rapidly increased as the disease progressed. […] However, the positive rates of viral RNA maintained above 60% in the first 11 days after initial onset of symptoms, and then rapidly decreased. […] Before the 11th day after initial onset of symptoms, nucleic acid test is key for confirmation of viral infection.

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&gt;
This paper presents an evidence-based strategy for improving clinical outcomes in COVID-19. […] These two aspects of the disease suggest two different patterns of clinical emphasis that seem on the surface to be not entirely concordant. […] Thus, one clinical strategy involves supporting patient innate and adaptive immune responses early in the time course of illness, with the goal of improving the timeliness, readiness, and robustness of both the innate and adaptive immune responses. […] Thus, the second clinical strategy is to prevent or mitigate excessive inflammatory response to prevent the cytokine storm associated with high mortality risk. […] Clinical support for immune system pathogen clearance mechanisms involves obligate activation of immune response components that are inherently inflammatory. […] This puts the goals of the first clinical strategy (immune activation) potentially at odds with the goals of the second strategy(mitigation of proinflammatory effects).

&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&gt;
Therefore, in response to the estimated potential impact of COVID-19 on Johns Hopkins Aramco Healthcare (joint venture between Saudi Aramco and Johns Hopkins Medicine International), several initiatives were taken by the hospital’s inpatient pharmacy department with focus on infection control, staffing, meeting clinical operational challenges, ethics, increased utilization of automation, and maintenance of employee wellness to prepare for this challenge. […] The key focus areas include development of an institutionalized COVID-19 protocol, measures to improve infection control when handling and dispensing medications, modified staffing plan, system changes in peri-operative areas, keeping pharmacy professionals updated about new and scientific researches, increased utilization of automation, clinical interventions by pharmacist ensuring appropriate utilization of medications while monitoring for drug-drug interactions, adverse drug event prevention, and preparing for handling drug shortages.

[…] In this commentary, we provide specific recommendations for the rapid implementation of clinical distancing techniques.

Initially, nasopharyngeal testing was performed only on women with a positive screen (symptoms or exposure) but subsequently, testing was universally performed on all women admitted to labor and delivery. […] Eighty-one patients were tested because of a positive screen (symptoms [&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 60] or exposure only [&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 21]) and 75 patients were universally tested (all asymptomatic). […] Pregnant women who presented with COVID19-related symptoms and subsequently tested positive for COVID-19 have a higher rate of preterm delivery and need for respiratory support than asymptomatic pregnant women. […] It is important to be particularly rigorous in caring for COVID-19 infected pregnant women who present with symptoms.

Although in some recent studies a clinical improvement in COVID-19 patients has been observed, the clinical efficacy of CQ and HCQ in COVID-19 has yet to be proven with randomized controlled studies, many of which are currently ongoing, also considering pharmacokinetics, optimal dosing regimen, therapeutic level and duration of treatment and taking into account patients with different severity degrees of disease. […] Here we review what is currently known on the mechanisms of action of CQ and HCQ as anti-viral, anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic drugs and discuss the up-to-date experimental evidence on the potential mechanisms of action of CQ/HCQ in Sars-Cov2 infection and the current clinical knowledge on their efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. […] Given the role of iron in several human viral infections, we also propose a different insight into a number of CQ and HCQ pharmacological effects, suggesting a potential involvement of iron homeostasis in Sars-Cov-2 infection and COVID-19 clinical course.

&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&gt;
In clinical practice, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are extensively used for the treatment of hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases. […] Yet, it has been claimed that both ARBs and ACE-Is could result potentially useful in the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. […] Older COVID-19-affected patients with cardiovascular comorbidities exhibit a more severe clinical course and a worse prognosis, with many of them being also treated with ARBs or ACE-Is. […] Despite the relevance of experimental animal studies, to comprehensively address the question of the potential hazards or benefits of ACE-Is and ARBs on the clinical course of COVID-19-affected patients treated by these anti-hypertensive drugs, we will need randomized human studies. […] Since ACE-Is and ARBs have different molecular targets, the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection could be also different in patients treated by one or the other of these two drug classes.

[…] The clinical features, laboratory examination indexes and HRCT evolution findings of 270 COVID-19 pneumonia patients were analyzed. &lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; 264 cases (95.74%) were positive at the first time nucleic acid test, 6 cases (2.22%) were negative, after multiple inspections, 270 cases (100%) were positive. […] During this study, a total of 173 patients (64.08%) were recovered after treatment. &lt;b&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/b&gt; In some epidemiological backgrounds, CT imaging manifestations and evolutionary characteristics are of great significance for early warning of lung injury, assessment of disease severity, and assistance in clinical typing and post-treatment follow-up.

In this work, we review its major impacts on procedures and workflow of clinical physics tasks, and suggest alternate pathways to avoid major disruption or discontinuity of physics tasks in the context of small, medium, and large radiation oncology clinics. […] Three models of facilities characterized by the number of clinical physicists, daily patient throughput, and equipment were identified for this purpose. […] For identical objectives of continuity of clinical operations, with constraints such as social distancing and unavailability of staff due to system strain, however with the possibility of remote operations, the performance of these models was investigated. […] General clinical tasks requiring on-site personnel presence or otherwise were evaluated to determine the scalability of the three models at this point in the course of disease spread within their surroundings. […] The clinical physics tasks within three models could be divided into two categories.

[…] Although digestive tract has been recognized as an infection route, it has not been possible to fully investigate the association between HCoVs infection and the gastrointestinal symptoms because of the limited number of pediatric cases. […] It has been necessary to pay more attention on gastrointestinal transmission to identify the infected children early and avoid the children without apparent or mild symptoms becoming the sources of infection.

[…] Fever (84.8%; 95% CI, 78.5% to 90.1%) was identified as the most common clinical manifestation in all COVID-19 patients, and signs of respiratory infection were also frequently present in these patients. […] When comparing the clinical features according to the location of diagnosis, fever and dyspnea were less frequent in patients diagnosed outside of Wuhan (fever: 78.1%; 95% CI, 73.2% to 82.7%; dyspnea: 3.80%; 95% CI, 0.13% to 12.22%) than in patients diagnosed in Wuhan (fever: 91.7%; 95% CI, 88.0% to 94.8%; dyspnea: 21.1%; 95% CI, 13.2% to 30.3%).

&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&gt;
Cancer patients are a special group, the immunity of them will be suppressed because of various anti-tumor treatments, and the risk of infection will be greatly increased, so we will report clinical features of 9 cancer patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. 5 (56%) patients were ordinary type, 3 (33%) were severe type, and 1 (11%) was critical type. […] From the clinical outcomes of these 8 patients, western combined therapy of traditional Chinese medicine was indeed an effective treatment method. […] D-dimmer rise, infection index rise, and chest CT(computed tomography) progression may be clinical warning indicators for severe patients, in our study, more 50% of patients had elevated levels of these indicators, but only 44% (including the dead) of patients had received treatment in the intensive care unit. 5 (56%) ordinary type patients had been discharged, while the 1 (11%) critical type patient died 3 days after admission.

To determine the prevalence and clinical presentation of COVID-19 among HCWs with self-reported fever or respiratory symptoms. […] Health care workers employed in the participating hospitals who experienced fever or respiratory symptoms were asked to voluntarily participate in a screening for infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. […] Structured interviews were conducted to document symptoms for all HCWs with confirmed COVID-19. […] Of 9705 HCWs employed (1722 male [18%]), 1353 (14%) reported fever or respiratory symptoms and were tested. […] Only 3 (3%) of the HCWs identified through the screening had a history of travel to China or northern Italy, and 3 (3%) reported having been exposed to an inpatient with a known diagnosis of COVID-19 before the onset of symptoms. […] Within 2 weeks after the first Dutch case was detected, a substantial proportion of HCWs with self-reported fever or respiratory symptoms were infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, likely as a result of acquisition of the virus in the community during the early phase of local spread. […] The high prevalence of mild clinical presentations, frequently not including fever, suggests that the currently recommended case definition for suspected COVID-19 should be used less stringently.

The prioritisation of high value cancer interventions must be embedded in the agenda for the pandemic response, ensuring that no inconsistency or discrepancy emerge in the health planning processes.The aim of this work is to organise health interventions for breast cancer management and research in a tiered framework (high, medium, low value), formulating a scheme of prioritisation per clinical cogency and intrinsic value or magnitude of benefit. […] The public health tools and schemes for priority setting in oncology have been used as models, aspiring to capture clinical urgency, value in healthcare, community goals and fairness, while respecting the principles of benevolence, non-maleficence, autonomy and justice.We discuss the priority health interventions across the cancer continuum, giving a perspective on the role and meaning to maintain some services (undeferrable) while temporarily abrogate some others (deferrable). […] Considerations for implementation and the essential link to pre-existing health services, especially primary healthcare, are addressed, outlining a framework for the development of effective and functional services, such as telemedicine.The discussion covers the theme of health systems strategising, and why oncology care, in particular breast cancer care, should be maintained in parallel to pandemic control measures, providing a pragmatic clinical model within the broader context of public healthcare schemes.

[…] Compared to the PBS-treated control group, azathioprine-immunosuppressed ferrets exhibited a longer period of clinical illness, higher virus titers in nasal turbinate, delayed virus clearance, and significantly lower serum neutralization (SN) antibody titers. […] Taken together, all antiviral drugs tested marginally reduced the overall clinical scores of infected ferrets but did not significantly affect &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; virus titers. […] Despite the potential discrepancy of drug efficacies between animals and humans, these preclinical ferret data should be highly informative to future therapeutic treatment of COVID-19 patients.&lt;b&gt;IMPORTANCE&lt;/b&gt; The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic continues to spread worldwide, with rapidly increasing numbers of mortalities, placing increasing strain on health care systems. […] While most of the drug treatments marginally reduced clinical symptoms, they did not reduce virus titers, with the exception of emtricitabine-tenofovir treatment, which led to diminished virus titers in nasal washes at 8 dpi. […] As several FDA-approved or repurposed drugs are being tested as antiviral candidates at clinics without sufficient information, rapid preclinical animal studies should proceed to identify therapeutic drug candidates with strong antiviral potential and high safety prior to a human efficacy trial.

[…] Our reasoning highlights how challenging a balanced approach to a patient with fever and flu-like symptoms can be. […] At present, clinical workup of COVID-19 remains a hard task to accomplish.

This has been proposed with a double aim: (1) an in-depth verification of the analytical and clinical performances presented by the manufacturer and (2) an economy of scale in terms of centralized validation for all the laboratories using the tests subject to evaluation. […] Methods A retrospective validation study was conducted including the serum of 125 patients in order to determine the analytical and clinical performances of the LIAISON®SARS-CoV-2 from DiaSorin® detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and to compare its clinical performance with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test from Euroimmun®, one of the first commercially available tests allowing the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG. […] Results The performances of the LIAISON®SARS-CoV-2 satisfied all the acceptance criteria and provided “real world” analytical and clinical performances very close to the ones reported by the manufacturer in its insert kit. […] The analytical and clinical performances are excellent, and the automation of the test offers important rates, ideal for absorbing an extension of testing.

[…] There was a strong positive correlation (r = 0.76, p = 0.01) between the number of registered clinical trials and the public interest in the top ten proposed therapies. […] Moving forward, a concerted effort focused on implementing large, well-coordinated and carefully designed multi-armed clinical trials will help to ensure that the most promising therapeutic options are rigorously studied and clinically meaningful results produced.

&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&gt;
The COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets, with the most common symptoms being high fever, cough, myalgia, atypical symptoms included sputum production, headache, hemoptysis and diarrhea. […] However, the incubation period can range from 2 to 14 days without any symptoms. […] It is particularly true with gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in which patients can still shed the virus even after pulmonary symptoms have resolved. […] Given the high percentage of COVID-19 patients that present with GI symptoms (e.g., nausea and diarrhea), screening patients for GI symptoms remain essential. […] Moreover, the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, diagnostic procedures, treatments and prevention of the gastrointestinal manifestations of COVID-19 remain to be elucidated.

[…] Women from the COVID-19 cohort were more likely than pre-COVID-19 women to present clinically significant levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms [OR=1.94, χ2(1)=10.05, p=.002]. […] Multiple regression analyses indicated that COVID-19 pregnant women having a previous psychiatric diagnosis or low income would be more prone to elevated distress and psychiatric symptoms.

&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&gt;
After segmenting and parsing documents, we conducted analysis of overrepresented words in patient symptoms. […] We then developed a word embedding-based convolutional neural network for predicting COVID-19 test results based on patients’ self-reported symptoms. […] As a result, screening algorithms were adapted to include these symptoms. […] Informatics tools such as NLP and AI methods can have significant clinical impacts when applied to data streams early in the development of clinical systems for outbreak response.

We agree with the authors that, despite conflicting clinical data to date, it is possible that HCQ may have a protective effect in the setting of COVID-19. […] More importantly, we agree that optimal HCQ dosage and timing is a critical underpinning for clinical trials.

This risk is even more serious in pediatric dentistry, since affected children, frequently, present an asymptomatic, mild or moderate clinical viral infection and, therefore, they may play a major role in community-based COVID-19 transmission. […] The aim of this paper is to provide clinical recommendations, presenting a needed tool for dentists to allow a valid and safe how-to-do protocol.

[…] The aim of this systematic review is to summarize the preliminary experiences and ongoing clinical trials of the major candidates and challenges of the vaccine strategies in humans. […] Finally, we scrutinized the Cochrane COVID-19 study register and the COVID-19 section of ClinicalTrials.gov database for identifying relevant ongoing clinical trials. […] Our search identified 1359 published papers, 478 pre-print articles and 367 ongoing clinical trials. […] Finally, only ten ongoing clinical trials met the inclusion criteria. […] Specifically, seven developed vaccines for the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and three clinical trials assessed the protective role of BCG vaccine against COVID-19. […] Notwithstanding the limitations of our analysis, given by the absence of available results, we try to provide a comprehensive view of the ongoing clinical trials in humans.

[…] The quality and contents of early covid-19 guidelines were also compared with recent clinical guidelines for MERS and SARS. 2836 studies were identified, of which 2794 were excluded after screening. […] Overall, the clinical guidelines lacked detail and covered a narrow range of topics.

[…] A systematic review of GI symptoms and a meta-analysis comparing symptoms in severe and non-severe patients was performed using RevMan V.5.3. […] Our study revealed that diarrhoea (7.8%) followed by nausea and/or vomiting (5.5 %) were the most common GI symptoms. […] We performed a meta-analysis comparing the odds of having GI symptoms in severe versus non-severe COVID-19-positive patients. 4 studies for nausea and/or vomiting, 5 studies for diarrhoea and 3 studies for abdominal pain were used for the analyses.

Experienced clinicians served as participants, debriefed, and provided feedback that was incorporated into local site clinical pathways, job aids, and suggested practices. […] Clinical management of an actual suspected coronavirus disease 2019 patient with difficult airway demonstrated very similar success and anticipated failure points. […] Following debriefing and assembly of a success/failure grid, a coronavirus disease 2019 airway bundle template was created using these simulations and clinical experiences for others to adapt to their sites.

The objective of this study was to rate the adequacy of healthcare workers (HCWs) and hospital settings on RID prevention using unannounced standardized patients (USP) in clinical settings of hospital gateways. […] Trained USPs visited 5 clinical settings: information desks, registration desks, two outpatient departments and the emergency departments in 10 hospitals across 3 cities of Inner Mongolia, China. […] USPs observed the hospital air ventilation and distance from the nearest hand-washing facilities to each clinical setting, then mimicked symptoms of either tuberculosis or influenza before observing the HCW’s behavior. […] A total of 480 clinical-setting assessments were made by 19 USPs. […] Compared to the information desk, adequacy of triage and preventing the spread of airborne droplets by physicians in the three clinical departments was less likely to be adequate. […] Triage services for USPs simulating symptoms of influenza were 2.6 times more likely to be adequate than for those simulating symptoms of tuberculosis but there was no significant difference in the prevention of the spread of airborne droplets.

[…] The mean difference (home measurement was subtracted from clinical measurement) in FEV&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; was 0.18 L in CF (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.08-0.27 L; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) and 0.12 L in asthma (95%CI 0.05-0.19 L; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001).

[…] A total of 663 articles were screened and 12 clinical studies (seven peer-reviewed and published studies and five non-peer-reviewed studies from pre-print servers) with a total sample size of 3543 patients were included. […] Some of the clinical studies demonstrated good virological and clinical outcomes with HCQ alone or in combination with azithromycin in COVID-19 patients, although the studies had major methodological limitations. […] The results of efficacy and safety of HCQ in COVID-19, as obtained from the clinical studies, are not satisfactory, although many of these studies had major methodological limitations.

&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&gt;
We summarize what makes SARS-CoV2 different from previous highly pathogenic coronaviruses and why it is so contagious, with focus on its clinical presentation and diagnosis, which is mandatory to start the appropriate management and reduce the transmission. […] Clinical management involves the intensive care approach with intubation and mechanical ventilation in the most serious cases and drug therapy with several apparently promising old and new molecules.
