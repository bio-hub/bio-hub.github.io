Routine blood test revealed WBC &lt;4.0×10(9)/L in 8 petients (26.67%) , (4-10) ×10(9)/L in 22 petients (73.33%) , and WBC&gt;4.0×10(9)/L in 4 petients (13.33%) during the disease.Lymphocyte count &lt;1.0×10(9)/L occurred in 12 petients (40%),abnormal liver function in 7 petients (23.33%) ,myocardial damage in 5 petients(16.67%), elevated D-dimer (&gt;0.5mg/l) in 5 patients (16.67%). […] Compared with normal patients, the average exposure times, cumulative exposure time, BMI, Fever time, white blood cell count, liver enzyme, LDH, myoenzyme and D-dimer were significantly increased in severe patients, while the lymphocyte count and albumin levels in peripheral blood were significantly decreased.Chest CT mainly showed patchy shadows and interstitial changes.According to imaging examination, 11 patients (36.67%) showed Unilateral pneumonia and 19 patients (63.33%) showed bilateral pneumonia,4 patients (13.33%) showed bilateral multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity.Compared with the patients infected in the protected period, the proportion of severe infection and bilateral pneumonia were both increased in the patients infected in unprotected period. <b>Conclusion:</b> Medical staffs are at higher risk of infection.Infection rates are associated with contact time, the amount of suction virus. […] Severe patients had BMI increased, heating time prolonged , white blood cell count, lymphocyte count, D-dimer and albumin level significantly changed and were prone to be complicated with liver damage and myocardial damage.Strict protection measures is important to prevent infection for medical workers. <b>目的：</b> 探讨医务人员新型冠状病毒肺炎（简称新冠肺炎）的临床特征。

<b>Objective:</b> To explore and analyze the possible mechanism of liver injury in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (novel coronavirus pneumonia, NCP). <b>Methods:</b> The correlation between ALT, AST and other liver enzyme changes condition and NCP patients’ disease status reported in the literature was comprehensively analyzed. […] ACE2 expression in liver tissue for novel coronavirus was analyzed based on single cell sequencing (GSE115469) data. […] RNA-Seq method was used to analyze Ace2 expression and transcription factors related to its expression in liver tissues at various time-points after hepatectomy in mouse model of acute liver injury with partial hepatectomy. <i>t</i>-test or Spearman rank correlation analysis was used for statistical analysis. <b>Results:</b> ALT and AST were abnormally elevated in some patients with novel coronavirus infection, and the rate and extent of ALT and AST elevation in severe NCP patients were higher than those in non-severe patients. […] Liver tissue results of single cell sequencing and immunohistochemistry showed that ACE2 was only expressed in bile duct epithelial cells of normal liver tissues, and very low in hepatocytes. […] In a mouse model of acute liver injury with partial hepatectomy, Ace2 expression was down-regulated on the first day, but it was elevated up to twice of the normal level on the third day, and returned to normal level on seventh day when the liver recovered and hepatocyte proliferation stopped. […] Whether this phenomenon suggests that the bile duct epithelial cells with positive expression of Ace2 participate in the process of liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy deserves further study. […] In RNA-Seq data, 77 transcription factors were positively correlated with the expression of ACE2 (r &gt; 0.2, FDR &lt; 0.05), which were mainly enriched in the development, differentiation, morphogenesis and cell proliferation of glandular epithelial cells. <b>Conclusion:</b> We assumed that in addition to the over activated inflammatory response in patients with NCP, the up-regulation of ACE2 expression in liver tissue caused by compensatory proliferation of hepatocytes derived from bile duct epithelial cells may also be the possible mechanism of liver tissue injury caused by 2019 novel coronavirus infection. <b>目的：</b> 探索和分析新型冠状病毒感染肺炎（NCP）患者发生肝损伤的可能机制。

<b>Objective:</b> To analyze the clinical characteristics of cases of novel coronavirus pneumonia and a preliminary study to explore the relationship between different clinical classification and liver damage. <b>Methods:</b> Consecutively confirmed novel coronavirus infection cases admitted to seven designated hospitals during January 23, 2020 to February 8, 2020 were included. […] ALT, AST, ALB and TBil of the severe or critical subgroups were 60.25 (40.88 ~ 68.90) U/L, 37.00 (20.88 ~ 64.45) U/L, 35.75 (28.68 ~ 42.00) g/L, and 20.50 (11.28 ~ 25.00) mmol/L, respectively. <b>Conclusion:</b> The results of this multicenter retrospective study suggests that novel coronavirus pneumonia combined with liver damage is more likely to be caused by adverse drug reactions and systemic inflammation in severe patients receiving medical treatment. […] Therefore, liver function monitoring and evaluation should be strengthened during the treatment of such patients. <b>目的：</b> 分析新型冠状病毒肺炎病例的临床特征，初步探讨不同临床分型与肝功能损伤的关系。

<b>Objective:</b> To understand the clinical characteristics, change of liver function, influencing factors and prognosis in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) combined with liver injury. <b>Methods:</b> The general conditions, biochemical indicators of liver, blood clotting mechanism, routine blood test, UGT1A1 * 28 gene polymorphism and other data of 40 cases with COVID-19 admitted to the isolation ward of Tangdu Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. […] The clinical characteristics, influencing factors and prognosis of liver injury in patients with liver injury group and those with normal liver function group were compared. […] Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the main influencing factors of liver injury. <b>Results:</b> Of the 40 cases, 25 were male (62.5%) and 15 were female (37.5%), aged 22 to 83 (53.87 ± 15.84) years. […] Liver injury was occurred in 22 cases (55%) during the course of the disease. […] Liver function injury was more likely to occur in patients who used many types of drugs and large amounts of hormones (<i>P</i> = 0.002, <i>P</i> = 0.031), and there was no correlation with the TA6TA7 mutation in the UGT1A1 * 28 gene locus. […] Multiple regression analysis showed that the occurrence of liver injury was only related to critical illness. […] The liver function of all patients had recovered within one week after conventional liver protection treatment. <b>Conclusion:</b> COVID-19 combined with liver function injury may be due to the slight elevation of transaminase, mostly around the second week of the disease course. […] Severe patients have a higher proportion of liver injury, and critical type is an independent risk factor for liver injury. <b>目的：</b> 了解新型冠状病毒肺炎（COVID-19）住院患者合并肝损伤的临床特点、肝功能变化、影响因素及预后。

[…] These investigations in SARS-CoV-2-positive pregnant women are vital, as their derangement may signal a more severe COVID-19 infection, and may warrant pre-emptive admission and consideration of delivery to achieve maternal stabilization.

[…] The overall prevalence of chronic liver disease at baseline was 3% (95% CI 2%-4%; I<sup>2</sup> = 29.1%). […] Individuals with severe COVID-19 disease had relevant alterations of liver enzymes and coagulative profile, probably due to the innate immune response against the virus.

We reported the distributional and temporal patterns of liver injury indicators in these patients and determined their associated factors and death risk. […] Longitudinal liver function tests were retrospectively analyzed and correlated with the risk factors and death. […] Liver injury dynamic patterns differed in alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and total bilirubin (TBIL). […] AST abnormality was associated with the highest mortality risk compared to other indicators of liver injury during hospitalization. […] Common factors associated with elevated liver injury indicators were lymphocyte count decrease, neutrophil count increase, and male gender. […] CONCLUSION: The dynamic patterns of liver injury indicators and their potential risk factors may provide an important explanation for the COVID-19-associated liver injury. […] Because elevated liver injury indicators, particularly AST, are strongly associated with the mortality risk, our study indicates that these parameters should be monitored during hospitalization.

Liver impairment has been frequently reported as a common manifestation, although its clinical significance is still unclear, particularly in patients with underlying chronic liver disease (CLD). […] To summarize the changes in liver function tests during SARS-CoV-2 infection and the impact of COVID-19 in patients with underlying CLD. […] A literature review using online database Pubmed was done using the search terms “SARS-CoV-2”, “COVID-19”, “liver”, “cirrhosis” and “liver transplantation”. […] COVID-19 is frequently associated with different degrees of abnormal liver function tests, most notably transaminases, which are usually transitory and of mild degree. […] Available evidence suggests that liver injury may result from direct pathogenic effect by the virus, systemic inflammation or toxicity from commonly used drugs in this subset of patients. […] SARS-CoV-2 infection in children is associated with minimal or no increase in liver enzymes, thus the presence of abnormal liver function tests should trigger evaluation for underlying liver diseases. […] Although it seems that patients with CLD are not at greater risk for acquiring the infection, those with cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, autoimmune liver diseases or liver transplant may have a greater risk for severe COVID-19. […] Abnormal liver function tests during the course of COVID-19 are common, though clinically significant liver injury is rare. […] Further research is needed focusing on the effect of existing liver-related comorbidities on treatment and outcome of COVID-19.

Liver transplantation is considered the ultimate solution for patients with end-stage chronic liver disease or acute liver failure. […] Patients with liver transplant need special care starting from preoperative preparation, surgical intervention ending with postoperative care. […] Such a state of immune suppression could predispose to different types of infections in liver transplant recipients. […] Certain infection control precautions are needed to protect immunocompromised and vulnerable patients, including liver transplant candidates and recipients from acquiring COVID-19 infection. […] Management of immunosuppressive therapy and drug-drug interactions in liver transplant recipients infected with COVID-19 should be cautiously practiced to prevent rejection and effectively treat the underlying infection. […] In this report, we are trying to summarize available evidence about different aspects of the management of liver transplant candidates and recipients in the era of COVID-19.

Patients with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) experience various degrees of liver function abnormalities. […] Liver injury requires extensive work-up and continuous surveillance and can be multifactorial and heterogeneous in nature. […] In the context of COVID-19, clinicians will have to determine whether liver injury is related to an underlying liver disease, drugs used for the treatment of COVID-19, direct effect of the virus, or a complicated disease course.

For patients with end-stage liver failure, liver transplantation is the only option. […] There is an urgent need for ethical frameworks to balance the need for liver transplantation against the availability of national resources. […] To describe the ethical tension arising in this setting, we propose a novel ethical framework, the Quadripartite Equipoise (QE) score, that is applicable to liver transplantation in the context of limited national resources. […] Seventeen large- and medium- sized liver transplant centers from twelve countries across four continents participated.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been associated with acute liver injury manifested by increased liver enzymes in reports worldwide. […] Prevalence of liver injury and associated clinical characteristics are not well-defined. […] We aim to identify the prevalence of and risk factors for development of COVID-19 associated acute liver injury in a large cohort in the United States. […] Acute liver injury was categorized as mild if alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was &gt; upper limit of normal (ULN) but &lt; two times ULN, moderate if ALT was between two and five times ULN, and severe if ALT was &gt; five times ULN. […] Among patients who tested positive, 45% had mild, 21% moderate, and 6.4% severe liver injury. […] In multivariable analysis, severe acute liver injury was significantly associated with elevated inflammatory markers including ferritin (OR 2.40, p&lt;0.001) and IL-6 (OR 1.45, p=0.009). […] Patients with severe liver injury had a more severe clinical course, including higher rates of ICU admission (69%), intubation (65%), renal replacement therapy (33%), and mortality (42%). […] Acute liver injury is common in patients who test positive for SARS-CoV-2, but is most often mild. […] However, among the 6.4% of patients with severe liver injury, a severe disease course should be anticipated.
